1
00:00:03.703 --> 00:00:09.608
The system of inequity is embedded in
history, culture, and identity.

2
00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:13.907
lt has internal components and external
components.

3
00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:20.653
These components are moved or
influenced by power and economics.

4
00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:28.460
The internal components consist of bias,
privilege, and internalized racism.

5
00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:32.924
The external components play out in
relationships

6
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:38.126
which are interpersonal, institutional, and
structural.

7
00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:42.106
All of these layers are happening
simultaneously.

8
00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:46.010
And they are churning out inequities.

9
00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:34.585
ln the western world, we worship the
disguise of science

10
00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:37.326
All else can remain silent.

11
00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:40.695
Duck the supernatural, the spiritual and
unexplained oddities

12
00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:45.397
We need facts. That which you can see
and grasp. Fact.

13
00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:48.974
Europe is not and has never been a
continent,

14
00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:51.676
yet they teach us it all through school

15
00:01:51.978 --> 00:01:53.946
So when l raise my hand in class and ask

16
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.942
"Ey teach, continent defined as a large
land mass,

17
00:01:57.317 --> 00:01:59.581
completely or almost completely
surrounded by water.

18
00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:03.654
Europe is neither large nor even almost
surrounded by water.

19
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.884
How is it a continent?" l get looked at like
a fool

20
00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:10.460
Teach tells me, "Because it is."

21
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.491
Now, this never flew with me as a kid l
ain't get the answer needed,

22
00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:16.625
l'm disrupting the rest of yo class period

23
00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:18.894
So now l'm in the principal's office being
asked to explain,

24
00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:20.803
why l'm questioning a continent's validity

25
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.603
Now l find myself saying, this country is
hypocrisy from top to bottom

26
00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:28.510
You've raised me to focus on facts

27
00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:31.808
l've done what you asked now you letting
me know l'm digging too deep

28
00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:49.634
Puerto Rico, in many ways, is very
homogeneous,

29
00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:51.499
in the way that it is perceived

30
00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:58.709
We have taken on an essential identity,
where we're all Latinos

31
00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:02.872
or we're all Puerto Ricans then we forget a
history of slavery

32
00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:06.443
We forget a history of white Spaniard
domination

33
00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:12.282
We forget a history of Arawak genocide,
and how that creates the Latino,

34
00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:15.361
and so often we think about the Puerto
Rican or the Latino,

35
00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:19.292
without thinking about the historical and
colonial legacies that have

36
00:03:19.432 --> 00:03:21.662
over time constructed who we are today

37
00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:58.662
My mother explained slavery to me,

38
00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:02.675
and l remember, l was really, you know
like, in elementary school,

39
00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:06.508
and she described slavery that people,
human beings were slaves,

40
00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:10.040
and l didn't understand what she meant so
l asked her to explain that

41
00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:13.414
"What, what do you mean? They had them
to do a lot of chores?"

42
00:04:14.487 --> 00:04:15.681
(Laughs) Because she had us doing a lot
of chores at home

43
00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:17.820
But l knew that wasn't what she meant,

44
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.017
but l wondered what do l compare this to?

45
00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:25.087
She said, "Oh no sugar, uh uh, they
couldn't be married;

46
00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:28.959
they couldn't keep their children; they
didn't have their own souls;

47
00:04:29.035 --> 00:04:31.902
everything was taken from them and you
know your grandfather,"

48
00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:36.965
she meant her father, "his father was a
slave." l said, "No way."

49
00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:42.980
l said, "Well why did the people let
themselves be slaves?"

50
00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:46.847
And she said, "Oh Ericka, it wasn't like
that;

51
00:04:47.553 --> 00:04:49.111
the whole government supported it."

52
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.988
Then l got really sad. So sad, l don't think
l could cry about it

53
00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:04.503
l just couldn't fathom, grown-ups as l
thought of them,

54
00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:09.071
being that mean, just mean! l didn't have a
name for it, just mean

55
00:05:13.613 --> 00:05:19.108
Hawaii was conquered by white people.
The Queen was dethroned.

56
00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:21.075
Hawaiian people were put on plantations,

57
00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:24.590
to work alongside Japanese people, and
Filipino, and Chinese people.

58
00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:27.190
Many Hawaiians were converted to
Christianity.

59
00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:29.988
There's a kind of assimilation that tries to
happen

60
00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:35.862
The Hawaiian monarchy wearing English
clothes, and you know, the collars,

61
00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:37.903
the dresses with the high collars.

62
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.804
The very Victorian, you know, English
kinds of clothes

63
00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:46.108
And people kind of glorifying that royalty,

64
00:05:47.246 --> 00:05:50.147
but yet, they're living in shacks

65
00:05:50.216 --> 00:05:52.150
And l'm not talking about grass shacks;

66
00:05:52.552 --> 00:05:55.749
l'm talking about squalor shacks, slums.

67
00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:03.826
No one had ever told me in school, no had
ever told me the truth

68
00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.864
They taught me about Crispus Attucks

69
00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:10.965
Okay, you know l don't have anything
against Crispus Attucks,

70
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:16.531
but, l needed to know more than the black
men who

71
00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:21.806
fought in the American Revolution, you
know. . .But l didn't get the truth

72
00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:25.647
l was told watered down stories about
Native Americans,

73
00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:37.253
that didn't speak any language that was
discernible.

74
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.261
African people that had bones through
their noses and had no language,

75
00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:47.939
except " uga buga." When l realized that
this is what not only l was taught,

76
00:06:48.274 --> 00:06:51.835
but all of the nation's children and people
were being taught this,

77
00:06:51.944 --> 00:06:53.844
l was so pissed off.

78
00:06:56.749 --> 00:07:01.812
l think there's a, a misconception that's out
there in mainstream society,

79
00:07:02.188 --> 00:07:07.216
that sees our people as primitive and
uncivilized.

80
00:07:07.894 --> 00:07:12.797
There was a high level of organized
society that existed around us

81
00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:16.060
to the point where l would say that as
colonizers came to our land,

82
00:07:16.135 --> 00:07:21.232
as the settlers came, they mimicked and
followed some of those ways,

83
00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:23.541
of looking at the way that we did our
governance

84
00:07:23.776 --> 00:07:25.175
But l'd like to start before that

85
00:07:25.344 --> 00:07:31.010
to talk about the strength and the, and the
way of life that, that we had,

86
00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:35.143
and sometimes it's difficult to, to talk fully
about who we are

87
00:07:35.254 --> 00:07:38.314
because over the years we've lost a lot.

88
00:07:41.327 --> 00:07:44.125
l had to learn U.S. history in a new way

89
00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:48.726
Learning about the Marshall lslands in
particular,

90
00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:51.994
the history of U.S. bomb testing on
Marshall lslands

91
00:07:52.238 --> 00:07:55.765
A device with one-thousand times the
energy of the bomb that shattered

92
00:07:55.842 --> 00:08:00.211
Hiroshima, exceeding the power of that
bomb as vastly as it exceeded,

93
00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:03.043
the greatest high explosive giants of World
War ll.

94
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.710
There's a one long skinny island where
the U.S. military base is

95
00:08:07.887 --> 00:08:09.878
and then there's this other island, called
Ebeye

96
00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.623
where all of the folks of color live

97
00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.289
and they come over during the day

98
00:08:13.359 --> 00:08:16.294
and work in a lot of the service sector jobs,

99
00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:19.257
and then go back at the end of the day,
and also have radiation,

100
00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:22.699
from all of the bomb testing that
happened, you know,

101
00:08:22.768 --> 00:08:26.101
in the mid-twentieth century. That was
something l had no idea about.

102
00:08:28.207 --> 00:08:31.040
How many of our stories are left untold?

103
00:08:33.079 --> 00:08:36.674
Buried under piles of dust waiting to be
forgotten

104
00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:45.087
Can we truly forget them, or do they just
get told in other ways?

105
00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:18.985
Fact. Racially, we are almost completely
the same.

106
00:09:19.292 --> 00:09:25.822
Ask an anthropologist. We are all, every
people, less than . 1 % different

107
00:09:26.098 --> 00:09:29.158
Other 99.9 is what makes us humankind,

108
00:09:34.307 --> 00:09:42.112
Fact. The human psyche will do almost
anything to remove dissonance

109
00:09:42.815 --> 00:09:45.978
Dissonance means that which is outside of
your comfort zone.

110
00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:51.720
When l was really young, probably up until
the age of about eight or nine,

111
00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:56.952
the social network, the relationships, the
family, friends,

112
00:09:57.129 --> 00:10:00.394
were all mostly people of South Asian
descent

113
00:10:01.233 --> 00:10:06.796
l wasn't self-aware of myself as a racial,
as a racial being

114
00:10:07.206 --> 00:10:13.008
And then something shifted, and, at that
point,

115
00:10:13.212 --> 00:10:19.447
l started rejecting my own culture,
community,

116
00:10:20.419 --> 00:10:22.410
quite, l think quite drastically

117
00:10:22.989 --> 00:10:27.323
And although there were so many people
of color that were around me,

118
00:10:27.927 --> 00:10:34.059
l really wanted to be accepted and
assimilate with, with white people

119
00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:44.174
l was taught to think that life that's worth
noticing and living,

120
00:10:44.543 --> 00:10:48.741
is just a little wedge of the three hundred
and sixty degrees.

121
00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:51.006
Now they didn't say it in so many words,

122
00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:56.319
but l was taught there are these lines that
mark off the rest of the world,

123
00:10:56.389 --> 00:11:00.189
and the rest of the world's people from
what is good,

124
00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:07.160
and in my coming up as a child, again and
again, l heard phrases like,

125
00:11:08.234 --> 00:11:09.394
"good families"

126
00:11:10.436 --> 00:11:11.994
"good neighborhoods"

127
00:11:13.072 --> 00:11:14.004
"good books"

128
00:11:14.907 --> 00:11:15.874
"good music"

129
00:11:16.542 --> 00:11:17.804
"good taste"

130
00:11:18.444 --> 00:11:19.536
"good manners"

131
00:11:21.147 --> 00:11:22.239
"good jobs"

132
00:11:22.481 --> 00:11:24.142
"good investments"

133
00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:31.047
Those "goods" demarcated what l was
meant to respect

134
00:11:31.624 --> 00:11:35.060
and beyond which l was not meant to stir

135
00:11:36.996 --> 00:11:40.932
The college l went to was really white and
really suburban

136
00:11:41.233 --> 00:11:45.033
so l had to find like a small sector of
people l could hang out with

137
00:11:45.104 --> 00:11:46.298
but most of those people were white.

138
00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:50.004
l remember, l'll never forget this, l saw an
lndian person on T.V.

139
00:11:50.076 --> 00:11:52.374
which back then was like unheard of, and
l'll be like

140
00:11:52.445 --> 00:11:56.438
"Oh my God, there's an lndian person on
T.V." And they'll be like

141
00:11:56.515 --> 00:11:58.073
"Well why is that such a big deal to you?"

142
00:11:58.384 --> 00:12:01.376
And l'm like, "What are you talking about,
l'm , l'm lndian."

143
00:12:03.122 --> 00:12:07.286
l remember when l didn't know l was
black.

144
00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.452
My mother is black and white.

145
00:12:09.528 --> 00:12:13.988
My grandmother is an lrish woman born
on a farm.

146
00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:18.426
My mother had very, very, very light white
skin, freckles

147
00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:20.198
and brown hair that fall straight.

148
00:12:20.539 --> 00:12:25.033
So here she is a black girl growing up
without

149
00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:29.040
the absolute black exterior, in a black
experience, in a black family.

150
00:12:31.016 --> 00:12:35.214
Where she's too light, and, and white to be
cool with black children,

151
00:12:35.488 --> 00:12:39.322
and too like black folks to be cool with
white children.

152
00:12:40.292 --> 00:12:45.889
My father is black and from Tennessee,
and my mother l think because

153
00:12:48.234 --> 00:12:50.065
(pause) though she was black didn't have

154
00:12:50.136 --> 00:12:54.038
you know my sisters are brown skinned,
nappy headed girls, you know.

155
00:12:55.341 --> 00:12:58.276
She couldn't, she couldn't fully understand
what that meant for us.

156
00:12:58.344 --> 00:13:01.507
So my mother would tell us things like, you
know

157
00:13:02.314 --> 00:13:05.147
"Yeah, you're, you're, you're black and,
and, and, and you're white

158
00:13:05.217 --> 00:13:08.584
but more than anything you're um, you're,
you're a good person.

159
00:13:09.922 --> 00:13:15.588
You're um, we have several, several
different cultures in us

160
00:13:15.661 --> 00:13:17.253
and in our background and duhduhduh"

161
00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:20.566
And l don't think she was deliberately
dodging the issue of race

162
00:13:20.566 --> 00:13:24.593
but l think she, she couldn't fully
understand the impact of you know

163
00:13:24.703 --> 00:13:29.072
no police officer they were pulling me over
and considered my racial mixture.

164
00:13:30.543 --> 00:13:33.671
When l was a couple of days old l was
adopted

165
00:13:34.146 --> 00:13:37.980
My birth parents are black-Colombians

166
00:13:38.083 --> 00:13:41.348
and my adopted family was Caucasian

167
00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:45.420
ln my parents' mind, l'm their child and
they're white

168
00:13:46.292 --> 00:13:49.090
and, what does that make me?

169
00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:55.161
And my adoptive father has talked about
what it was like for him

170
00:13:55.234 --> 00:14:01.503
to have my birth father, a black man, come
to stay with them

171
00:14:01.607 --> 00:14:04.201
in their house and come to church with us.

172
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:11.009
And for my adoptive dad to stand up and
introduce who my birth father was,

173
00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:15.417
and he said, really it was in that space
when he really realized

174
00:14:16.488 --> 00:14:20.356
that everyone else in the church was
looking at my birth dad,

175
00:14:20.426 --> 00:14:23.361
and now suddenly at me as a black
person

176
00:14:24.096 --> 00:14:27.725
and that was never something he'd had to
confront before

177
00:14:28.133 --> 00:14:32.593
and suddenly he realized that that was
something that l as an adult

178
00:14:33.272 --> 00:14:35.331
was connected to as well.

179
00:14:37.343 --> 00:14:38.435
For me as a Latino,

180
00:14:38.677 --> 00:14:42.169
l can choose to be one of multiple
identities.

181
00:14:42.248 --> 00:14:46.651
So if l moved to Michigan without talking, l
could pass for Arab.

182
00:14:47.086 --> 00:14:50.283
lf l move to California, l could pass for
Mexican.

183
00:14:50.489 --> 00:14:53.583
lf l move to Florida, l could be Cuban and
Puerto Rican.

184
00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:57.119
lf l'm in New York, l could be Dominican,
Puerto Rican

185
00:14:57.263 --> 00:14:59.322
or anything as long as l'm not downtown.

186
00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:00.524
That's where all the white folk hung out.

187
00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:02.701
l had a girlfriend

188
00:15:03.102 --> 00:15:07.232
who was raised in a black family on the
south side of Chicago

189
00:15:07.439 --> 00:15:09.737
and she was the only mixed race person
in her family.

190
00:15:10.409 --> 00:15:13.776
She ended up living in France for six years
with her sister

191
00:15:14.046 --> 00:15:16.480
who ended up settling in France, and over
there

192
00:15:17.249 --> 00:15:20.013
people there thought she was Moroccan

193
00:15:20.619 --> 00:15:23.179
because there's a large Moroccan and
Algerian population

194
00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:26.691
and so therefore in that environment she
was treated the way

195
00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:29.352
North African women in France are
treated.

196
00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:32.155
And she began to really identify with those
relationships

197
00:15:32.231 --> 00:15:35.530
and her primary source of support and
relationships

198
00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:37.592
ended up being Moroccan and Algerian
women.

199
00:15:37.803 --> 00:15:39.361
So she started to really identify with that.

200
00:15:39.471 --> 00:15:40.802
Then when she came back to the United
States

201
00:15:41.707 --> 00:15:44.505
she had this experience where she would,
you know

202
00:15:44.576 --> 00:15:48.774
black folks didn't totally accept her or they
did but they didn't really

203
00:15:48.847 --> 00:15:51.407
understand the whole thing in France that
she'd experienced

204
00:15:51.583 --> 00:15:54.677
and then white folks treated her like she
was black

205
00:15:55.154 --> 00:15:57.816
and so she was moving between different
racial dynamics

206
00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:00.786
in different social contexts, and somehow

207
00:16:01.327 --> 00:16:02.589
l was able to relate to her.

208
00:16:03.095 --> 00:16:05.825
And what it's helped me realize is that
identity is complex

209
00:16:06.165 --> 00:16:08.224
how we navigate and negotiate it is
complex

210
00:16:08.434 --> 00:16:10.834
and therefore l think we have to come up
with solutions

211
00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:14.237
to how we navigate the complexity of our
identities

212
00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:19.603
that are more flexible than the rigidness of
racism and race

213
00:16:27.119 --> 00:16:36.118
BlAS

214
00:16:39.264 --> 00:16:43.132
What is whiteness?

215
00:16:46.238 --> 00:16:50.174
Growing up l thought that my experience
was the American experience,

216
00:16:50.476 --> 00:16:54.378
and that everybody in the whole United
States had lived exactly,

217
00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.572
lived exactly as l did.

218
00:16:55.814 --> 00:17:01.275
And that's an experience where everybody
looked exactly like me

219
00:17:01.353 --> 00:17:03.287
So l was born in Medford, Oregon,

220
00:17:03.455 --> 00:17:07.653
and in Medford there were absolutely no
people of color,

221
00:17:07.826 --> 00:17:08.793
within the city limits.

222
00:17:12.398 --> 00:17:15.492
And then l met another woman, l mean
well she was a girl,

223
00:17:15.567 --> 00:17:17.626
so we're 11 years old, and l meet another
person,

224
00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:20.900
who then becomes my best friend and she
still is my best friend

225
00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:24.431
And her name was Serena Maria Cruz,
right?

226
00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:28.910
So Serena for me wasn't of color, she was
white

227
00:17:29.348 --> 00:17:34.411
So we're graduating, we're signing up for
the PSAT to take the test,

228
00:17:34.486 --> 00:17:36.784
and this is when we have gone to school
together for 5 or 6 years

229
00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:39.187
And we've been to each other's houses,
we've had birthday parties

230
00:17:39.358 --> 00:17:41.883
We're all involved in the same gifted
program activities

231
00:17:42.294 --> 00:17:49.894
And she's filling out her, her form, and
filling out her race

232
00:17:50.235 --> 00:17:53.671
and, and l'm filling out my form, and l look
over at Serena

233
00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:57.231
and l see her filling out the bubble for
Hispanic, and so,

234
00:17:57.376 --> 00:18:01.210
l actually reach out, and l grab her hand,
and l pull it up, and l tell her,

235
00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.646
"Serena, you're supposed to fill out the
white bubble."

236
00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:07.343
And she looks at me, and she says, she
says, she says,

237
00:18:07.419 --> 00:18:11.822
"Look at me Susie." She says, "Look at
me" like this.

238
00:18:12.858 --> 00:18:14.291
And l looked at her

239
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.293
and l didn't have any clue what she was
talking about.

240
00:18:17.963 --> 00:18:19.328
l didn't know what she was talking about.

241
00:18:20.732 --> 00:18:23.428
l think unconscious bias is really heavily
implicated,

242
00:18:23.735 --> 00:18:27.603
in white America's racial attitudes in this
age of Obama so-to-speak

243
00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:29.798
On the one hand, l think a lot of white
folks,

244
00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:33.538
who actually admire President Obama a
lot, who voted for him

245
00:18:33.846 --> 00:18:37.612
who find him to be an extremely erudite,
intelligent, capable leader.

246
00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:39.910
Nonetheless, and we know this from the
studies,

247
00:18:39.985 --> 00:18:43.785
many of those folks will indeed have
implicit associations

248
00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:47.790
between black folks and negativity,
different stereotypes, different views,

249
00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.988
and they've taken, many of them, the
implicit association tests

250
00:18:51.263 --> 00:18:53.231
that had been run by Harvard and
Princeton and others

251
00:18:53.532 --> 00:18:55.898
that can test for these sort of
subconscious biases.

252
00:18:56.034 --> 00:18:58.764
And what those studies have found is 7 5%
of white Americans

253
00:18:58.871 --> 00:19:01.533
have overtly pro-white anti-black bias.

254
00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.734
Well, by definition, some of those folks
voted for Barack Obama

255
00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.938
because he got about what, 44% of the
white vote, 45% .

256
00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:11.349
So by definition, a large number of white
folks

257
00:19:11.416 --> 00:19:14.943
who carry around this sort of baggage of
bias

258
00:19:17.856 --> 00:19:20.381
are willing to carve out these exceptions

259
00:19:20.626 --> 00:19:24.357
for those who make us comfortable, who
seem different from the norm

260
00:19:26.498 --> 00:19:28.022
My ex-husband is a white man.

261
00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:34.997
And he adores, and always has adored his
son.

262
00:19:39.044 --> 00:19:41.672
There were things that happened to my
son in the communities

263
00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.907
that he lived in because he was mixed
race

264
00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:49.651
that forced him to learn to use both
intellect and humor.

265
00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:56.655
However, l became aware, that as Noah
grew older

266
00:19:57.796 --> 00:19:58.763
and would defend himself

267
00:19:58.997 --> 00:20:02.797
his father would try to get him to defend
himself with anything but his fists

268
00:20:03.468 --> 00:20:04.935
even when he was under attack.

269
00:20:05.437 --> 00:20:07.803
And his dad was like, "Oh no no no, we
don't want him to be a bully.

270
00:20:08.106 --> 00:20:10.375
We don't want him to stoop to their level.

271
00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:12.002
l'm going to go and talk to the parents."

272
00:20:12.544 --> 00:20:15.672
Well later we sat down, he and l, and had
a conversation, it's like,

273
00:20:15.814 --> 00:20:19.443
"Well Noah's being hit, why shouldn't he
defend himself?

274
00:20:19.518 --> 00:20:22.715
He's tried every other methodology that
we could think of,

275
00:20:22.788 --> 00:20:25.985
and it hasn't worked, and so l think he has
the right to defend himself. "

276
00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:29.323
What came out of that conversation was
outside of my husbands awareness,

277
00:20:29.394 --> 00:20:31.385
because he loves me, and he loves his
son,

278
00:20:31.964 --> 00:20:35.331
is he had a fear of angry black men.

279
00:20:36.635 --> 00:20:39.832
He didn't want his son to be one of those
angry black men.

280
00:20:41.006 --> 00:20:45.568
And he was doing everything that he could
to keep that from happening

281
00:20:46.511 --> 00:20:51.471
even though it meant that Noah was
actually being,

282
00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:57.616
"oppressed" and " abused" and
"stigmatized" at school.

283
00:20:58.457 --> 00:21:05.727
We finally got to some of those early
messages about black boys

284
00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:10.799
that still run like wild fire through our
educational systems

285
00:21:11.903 --> 00:21:14.463
but it had also impacted my husband, and
he wasn't aware of it anymore.

286
00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:35.526
l have internalized messages that support
what it means to be white for me.

287
00:21:35.694 --> 00:21:40.666
And part of those messages are, l have
advice, right.

288
00:21:40.666 --> 00:21:43.897
l have knowledge that, that is good
knowledge

289
00:21:43.969 --> 00:21:46.767
that everybody deserves to have in order
to become like me.

290
00:21:46.838 --> 00:21:51.741
So l, l can give advice and people will
value my advice,

291
00:21:52.044 --> 00:21:54.638
and in particular l can give advice to
people of color.

292
00:21:56.114 --> 00:21:58.048
Recently l was in a meeting

293
00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:03.178
with a white woman, and an African
American woman

294
00:22:03.755 --> 00:22:07.748
where the African American woman was
trying to explain to the white woman,

295
00:22:07.893 --> 00:22:09.121
with me as a witness

296
00:22:09.928 --> 00:22:13.864
that, what the white woman was doing
was very oppressive to her.

297
00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:20.036
The African American woman took great
pains to be respectful

298
00:22:20.572 --> 00:22:26.977
to be as articulate as she could, while
being kind at the same time

299
00:22:27.646 --> 00:22:30.615
and really told a lot of stories

300
00:22:30.816 --> 00:22:33.944
in the hopes that this white woman would
understand

301
00:22:34.219 --> 00:22:36.881
in what ways she was oppressing her.

302
00:22:37.656 --> 00:22:42.593
And each time that the African American
woman would tell her story

303
00:22:42.994 --> 00:22:45.087
the white woman would say,

304
00:22:45.597 --> 00:22:50.625
"No, you were wrong. No, you must not
understand what l was telling you

305
00:22:51.236 --> 00:22:55.969
You obviously don't know me very well. l
would never do that."

306
00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:04.244
l call this behavior of always being right

307
00:23:04.983 --> 00:23:11.582
always thinking that you know better than
a person of color

308
00:23:12.124 --> 00:23:16.117
always trying to make sure that things
work for you,

309
00:23:16.795 --> 00:23:19.195
as internalized white superiority.

310
00:23:22.234 --> 00:23:28.139
l rarely really understand when l'm
exhibiting behavior that is racist,

311
00:23:28.206 --> 00:23:31.505
and internalized white superior in its
nature

312
00:23:33.044 --> 00:23:37.242
When well-meaning white people who've
never thought about privileged systems

313
00:23:37.315 --> 00:23:41.945
or whiteness, or race, start out,

314
00:23:44.055 --> 00:23:49.891
the teaching is very necessary to get them
past blame, shame, and guilt

315
00:23:49.961 --> 00:23:53.294
They were born into circumstances they
didn't invent

316
00:23:53.799 --> 00:23:56.063
They're born into history they didn't invent

317
00:23:57.035 --> 00:23:59.299
Rather then have them do the solipsistic
thing,

318
00:23:59.738 --> 00:24:02.707
of getting all self-involved in this,

319
00:24:03.175 --> 00:24:06.167
it's just very important to hold them,

320
00:24:06.244 --> 00:24:10.078
while they get into a rational frame of
mind,

321
00:24:10.148 --> 00:24:13.174
that the big systems exist that they didn't
know about,

322
00:24:13.819 --> 00:24:14.911
they were born into them

323
00:24:15.153 --> 00:24:18.247
The American myth of meritocracy doesn't
apply.

324
00:24:19.591 --> 00:24:24.290
We were not taught history, but this is
history they're learning

325
00:24:24.963 --> 00:24:31.892
And the American myth of meritocracy is
the unit of society,

326
00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:34.962
is the individual, and whatever you end up
with,

327
00:24:35.106 --> 00:24:37.233
must be what you wanted and worked for,

328
00:24:37.309 --> 00:24:41.837
and earned and deserved individually.
They've been taught that

329
00:24:42.747 --> 00:24:45.614
lt's not true - it's part way true.

330
00:24:46.051 --> 00:24:50.954
Your individual effort from your own sacred
center does matter.

331
00:24:51.189 --> 00:24:59.221
But, it's untrue, also, huge systems that
one's born into

332
00:24:59.297 --> 00:25:03.893
will bear on what one can do with one's
life, and how one won't see.

333
00:25:04.369 --> 00:25:07.236
And that's the part that has been missing
from that education.

334
00:25:07.372 --> 00:25:12.071
So these white women breaking up over
their first experience

335
00:25:12.143 --> 00:25:15.772
of hearing about racism, they are basket-
cases

336
00:25:15.847 --> 00:25:20.045
partly because of their bad, bad,
education.

337
00:25:20.652 --> 00:25:25.055
Their inability to see systemically, and it's
not their fault

338
00:25:25.824 --> 00:25:27.951
But they need to be hustled past it

339
00:25:28.226 --> 00:25:31.753
as quickly as possible with some remedial
words

340
00:25:31.963 --> 00:25:34.022
which l think l've just spoken here.

341
00:25:34.666 --> 00:25:37.396
You did not invent the systems you were
born into.

342
00:25:37.869 --> 00:25:40.303
They are there, and you were taught not to
see them

343
00:25:40.705 --> 00:25:43.367
and you're a very good student of what
you've been taught

344
00:25:44.009 --> 00:25:46.876
ln a way my entire career l owe, to white
privilege

345
00:25:46.945 --> 00:25:48.139
and l tell that story

346
00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:52.011
not sort of as a matter of self-flagellation
or out of guilt.

347
00:25:52.083 --> 00:25:54.711
l tell it because l want people to
understand

348
00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.113
that there can be two things that are true
at once.

349
00:25:57.222 --> 00:26:00.020
On the one hand we can work really hard,
but on the other hand

350
00:26:00.091 --> 00:26:03.788
our hard work can be met by access to an
opportunity structure.

351
00:26:03.862 --> 00:26:06.854
So it's not that l didn't work hard

352
00:26:06.932 --> 00:26:08.399
it's not that my great-grandfather who
came here from Russia in

353
00:26:08.466 --> 00:26:10.195
you know, the early part of the 1900's

354
00:26:10.302 --> 00:26:12.065
a Jewish immigrant who didn't speak
English;

355
00:26:12.304 --> 00:26:15.034
he worked eighteen hours a day. lt's not
that he didn't work hard

356
00:26:15.206 --> 00:26:18.972
but he also had access to jobs that were
off limits to people of color

357
00:26:19.044 --> 00:26:20.841
the day he got off the boat

358
00:26:21.846 --> 00:26:24.178
lt's a lot easier to recognize how you're
different

359
00:26:24.249 --> 00:26:25.716
and the doors are closed in your face

360
00:26:25.951 --> 00:26:30.081
than it is to recognize how you're normal

361
00:26:30.755 --> 00:26:33.121
and doors are open for you so that you
can step through them.

362
00:26:33.391 --> 00:26:38.761
This is not a reality that is only held by
white people.

363
00:26:39.164 --> 00:26:44.329
ln those areas where l am dominant, l just
assume

364
00:26:44.869 --> 00:26:47.064
that the doors that are held open for me
are held open for me

365
00:26:47.138 --> 00:26:49.333
because l'm such a fabulous human
being.

366
00:26:50.442 --> 00:26:52.000
lt doesn't dawn on me

367
00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:54.371
that l can have a conversation about my
dark complexion

368
00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:56.914
and l can have a conversation about being
black

369
00:26:56.982 --> 00:26:58.950
and l can have a conversation about being
a woman.

370
00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:01.912
So l don't have to deal with the fact that
because l'm educated

371
00:27:02.087 --> 00:27:03.782
and l speak standard English

372
00:27:03.955 --> 00:27:05.479
and l live a middle class existence

373
00:27:05.991 --> 00:27:10.155
there are entitlements that l have that
other people don't .

374
00:27:10.428 --> 00:27:13.920
There are entitlements that l have
because l'm heterosexual,

375
00:27:14.766 --> 00:27:16.233
that some people don't .

376
00:27:16.835 --> 00:27:19.235
There are entitlements that l have
because l'm U.S. born

377
00:27:20.505 --> 00:27:22.370
that some people don't. And l don't have
to think about them.

378
00:27:27.112 --> 00:27:31.105
And unless l take the blinders off and start
looking at the

379
00:27:31.182 --> 00:27:35.312
interconnected nature of power and
abusive power in particular

380
00:27:36.187 --> 00:27:37.984
l can't have this conversation.

381
00:27:38.223 --> 00:27:41.021
And so, in the context of race

382
00:27:41.459 --> 00:27:44.394
it shouldn't surprise us that white people

383
00:27:44.562 --> 00:27:47.292
have a very difficult time having this
conversation

384
00:27:47.365 --> 00:27:51.802
because they are not aware of the ways in
which they've been socialized

385
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:56.273
and acculturated to take their dominance
for granted

386
00:27:57.208 --> 00:28:02.271
even when they're being, they think,
politically aware, politically astute

387
00:28:02.514 --> 00:28:04.812
and moving a social justice agenda.

388
00:28:04.983 --> 00:28:06.518
There's a way in which whiteness

389
00:28:06.518 --> 00:28:08.884
and the normalcy of that whiteness,

390
00:28:08.987 --> 00:28:11.251
and the superiority of that whiteness

391
00:28:11.423 --> 00:28:14.950
shows up, that people are completely
unaware of.

392
00:28:18.163 --> 00:28:23.032
My sister-in-law, who's half black half
white, but looks white:

393
00:28:23.234 --> 00:28:26.294
blue eyes, whiter than most white folks,
very white.

394
00:28:27.105 --> 00:28:29.266
She and l, you know, we kind of grew up
together.

395
00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:32.104
We raised our children together so they're
first cousins

396
00:28:32.177 --> 00:28:36.238
and you know, it's wonderful, very, very
multicultural family.

397
00:28:36.881 --> 00:28:38.974
So we're going into Safeway, one day

398
00:28:39.517 --> 00:28:42.816
and Kathleen, my sister-in-law is in front of
me.

399
00:28:43.188 --> 00:28:46.589
And she's , you know, writing a check for
her groceries.

400
00:28:46.991 --> 00:28:48.925
Now my daughter, who at the time was ten
years old

401
00:28:48.993 --> 00:28:51.086
was standing with me, and l was directly
behind her

402
00:28:51.396 --> 00:28:52.920
you know, getting ready to get my
groceries.

403
00:28:52.997 --> 00:28:58.492
So, Kathleen comes up, and the checker
who's a strawberry blonde, freckled

404
00:28:59.003 --> 00:29:01.904
very delightful, warm, you know, the
checker,

405
00:29:01.973 --> 00:29:03.531
this young woman is talking to Kathleen

406
00:29:03.608 --> 00:29:05.599
"Hey how you doing? lsn't it a nice day
today?"

407
00:29:05.877 --> 00:29:07.310
They're just chatting up, and she says,
"Yes."

408
00:29:07.378 --> 00:29:09.209
So Kathleen writes her check

409
00:29:09.347 --> 00:29:11.178
and she steps off to the side with her
groceries

410
00:29:11.316 --> 00:29:12.305
'cause she's waiting for me.

411
00:29:13.118 --> 00:29:15.177
Of course again, Kathleen looks white
right?

412
00:29:15.887 --> 00:29:16.410
So l come up.

413
00:29:17.922 --> 00:29:23.861
No conversation, she looks up at me,
absolutely no just little chatter

414
00:29:24.562 --> 00:29:25.995
and l, l write my check.

415
00:29:26.064 --> 00:29:29.431
My daughter, however is ten, notices
immediately the difference

416
00:29:29.501 --> 00:29:30.968
in how she responds to me.

417
00:29:31.636 --> 00:29:35.436
So l write my check, and she goes, "l'm
gonna need two pieces of l.D."

418
00:29:36.908 --> 00:29:41.971
At which point, my daughter looks at me
and she gets very, very embarrassed,

419
00:29:42.046 --> 00:29:44.913
and tears are kind of coming up in her eye
like

420
00:29:45.083 --> 00:29:47.643
"Mommy, you're not gonna, you're not
gonna let her do this?

421
00:29:47.952 --> 00:29:49.385
Why is she doing this to us?" Right?

422
00:29:50.054 --> 00:29:52.579
So l'm trying to figure out what l should do

423
00:29:52.924 --> 00:29:55.552
'cause behind me are two elderly white
women. Right?

424
00:29:55.627 --> 00:29:59.529
Now l'm thinking, okay, so then l become
the angry black woman, right?

425
00:29:59.931 --> 00:30:00.420
And they're gonna be.

426
00:30:00.598 --> 00:30:03.465
And l just, l'm just trying to second-guess
all the drama.

427
00:30:04.035 --> 00:30:06.435
So then l, l just give her the two pieces of
l.D.

428
00:30:06.504 --> 00:30:08.438
You know some things you just got to
choose your battles, right?

429
00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:10.364
And then it gets worse

430
00:30:10.575 --> 00:30:14.033
she pulls out the bad check book, right?

431
00:30:14.145 --> 00:30:16.113
So this is the book that shows the people
who've written bad checks.

432
00:30:17.415 --> 00:30:22.614
So she starts searching for my license in
the bad checks

433
00:30:23.121 --> 00:30:25.385
at which point, it's just out of control now.

434
00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:27.214
Just as l'm standing there

435
00:30:27.959 --> 00:30:31.156
trying to decide what to do, and this is
really deeply humiliating

436
00:30:31.229 --> 00:30:35.393
and now my daughter is in full blown
emotionally upset, who's ten.

437
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.433
My sister-in-law walks back over

438
00:30:38.436 --> 00:30:42.668
and she steps in, and she says, "Excuse
me, why are you doing this?"

439
00:30:43.641 --> 00:30:45.438
And the checker goes

440
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:48.577
"Why are you taking her through all of
these changes, why you doing that?"

441
00:30:49.214 --> 00:30:51.273
She goes, "Well, um, this is our policy."

442
00:30:51.416 --> 00:30:54.044
She goes, "No, it's not your policy
because you didn't do that with me."

443
00:30:54.319 --> 00:30:56.514
"Oh well, l know you, you've been,"

444
00:30:56.588 --> 00:30:58.613
she goes, "No, no, she's been here for
years.

445
00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:00.385
l've only lived here for 3 months."

446
00:31:01.526 --> 00:31:04.290
And so at this point, the two white elderly
ladies go

447
00:31:04.395 --> 00:31:07.558
"Uh! l can't believe what this checker has
done with this woman

448
00:31:07.632 --> 00:31:09.293
that is totally unacceptable!"

449
00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.491
At which point, the manager walks over.

450
00:31:12.036 --> 00:31:14.732
So the manager walks over and says, "ls
there a problem here?"

451
00:31:15.206 --> 00:31:17.003
And then my sister-in-law again responds

452
00:31:17.242 --> 00:31:19.710
she goes, "Yes, there is a problem here.
Here is what happened."

453
00:31:20.278 --> 00:31:22.405
So you see, she used her white privilege

454
00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.311
and even though Kathleen is half black
and half white

455
00:31:24.515 --> 00:31:26.745
she recognizes what that means

456
00:31:27.185 --> 00:31:28.550
and she made the statement

457
00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.544
she pointed out the injustice

458
00:31:30.688 --> 00:31:32.622
and she as a result of that one act

459
00:31:33.057 --> 00:31:35.150
influenced everyone in that space.

460
00:31:35.426 --> 00:31:36.484
But what would've happened?

461
00:31:36.694 --> 00:31:39.128
l can't know for certain had the black
woman said

462
00:31:39.364 --> 00:31:42.094
"This is unfair, why are you doing this to
me?"

463
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.129
Would it have had the same impact?

464
00:31:44.335 --> 00:31:45.427
But Kathleen knew

465
00:31:45.803 --> 00:31:48.363
that she walked through the world
differently than l did

466
00:31:48.539 --> 00:31:51.303
and she used her white privilege to
educate

467
00:31:51.476 --> 00:31:54.104
and make right a situation that was wrong.

468
00:31:54.245 --> 00:31:56.270
That's what you can do, every single day

469
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:29.409
Well, within the black family

470
00:32:30.548 --> 00:32:35.315
within the black community, there are
legacies of color

471
00:32:35.653 --> 00:32:38.622
and most people felt that if you were
lighter skin

472
00:32:39.157 --> 00:32:43.594
you would be more acceptable, and
accepted to the whiter culture.

473
00:32:43.761 --> 00:32:45.456
But within the black community

474
00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:49.598
many times, people who were lighter skin
were rejected.

475
00:32:50.101 --> 00:32:53.400
My mother felt that, she was rejected by
my father's family.

476
00:32:54.205 --> 00:32:58.505
And, so there was this it's a lot of different
layers of the skin thing.

477
00:32:59.177 --> 00:33:00.804
Because within the white community

478
00:33:01.179 --> 00:33:03.272
if you were lighter skin, you were more
acceptable.

479
00:33:03.548 --> 00:33:04.742
But within the black community

480
00:33:04.816 --> 00:33:07.410
if you were lighter skin, many times you
were rejected.

481
00:33:08.619 --> 00:33:10.587
My assumptions were that light
complected women

482
00:33:10.688 --> 00:33:13.418
had it much easier in the world than darker
complected women.

483
00:33:13.791 --> 00:33:15.622
They were the women who were
considered beautiful.

484
00:33:16.361 --> 00:33:19.421
They were the women that people made a
way for.

485
00:33:19.664 --> 00:33:21.325
They were the people that look more like
white people

486
00:33:21.399 --> 00:33:22.297
than l look like white people

487
00:33:22.367 --> 00:33:24.198
so white people were more comfortable
with them.

488
00:33:24.302 --> 00:33:27.499
So life flowed in an easier fashion for
them.

489
00:33:28.172 --> 00:33:29.662
Until l actually got to know somebody

490
00:33:29.774 --> 00:33:33.107
who was really, really, really, light
complected

491
00:33:33.344 --> 00:33:36.472
and she laid out a reality that just broke
my heart.

492
00:33:36.581 --> 00:33:38.742
She desperately wanted to be the color
that l was.

493
00:33:39.183 --> 00:33:40.741
And basically what that taught me in terms
of

494
00:33:40.852 --> 00:33:44.845
internalized oppression and internalized
colorism, is how carefully

495
00:33:45.456 --> 00:33:51.326
we have been trained, culturally, to be
dissatisfied with our reality

496
00:33:51.729 --> 00:33:56.132
as people of color or actually white folk as
well.

497
00:33:56.434 --> 00:33:59.403
That the dissatisfaction is bread into the
culture

498
00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:02.871
and it is part of the ways in which we are
oppressed

499
00:34:03.441 --> 00:34:05.272
and the ways in which we oppress others.

500
00:34:07.245 --> 00:34:12.444
l think one of the biggest disturbances

501
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:15.883
that l have about my dad in particular

502
00:34:16.487 --> 00:34:20.355
has to do with his upset about how dark
he is.

503
00:34:20.691 --> 00:34:25.651
l remember about ten years ago, and l'm
54, so this wasn't that long ago.

504
00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:30.299
Ten years ago he was visiting, and he
showed me a picture of himself

505
00:34:30.568 --> 00:34:32.365
when he was 4 years old.

506
00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:35.334
Had never seen pictures of him when he
was young before

507
00:34:35.406 --> 00:34:39.433
he never showed any photos of himself to
us.

508
00:34:39.877 --> 00:34:43.404
And he showed me this picture, he was
four years old

509
00:34:43.581 --> 00:34:45.845
he showed me this picture, and he says,
"Look at this."

510
00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:52.220
l look at the picture, and it's this cute,
beautiful, four year old boy

511
00:34:52.523 --> 00:34:56.220
dark, dark, dark, and they lived in the
desert.

512
00:34:56.394 --> 00:34:58.862
They're even darker, right? So they lived
out there in desert.

513
00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:01.523
Dark picture of this four year old, this cute
four year old,

514
00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:03.328
and l said, "Dad, aww, you're so cute.

515
00:35:03.601 --> 00:35:05.501
How come you haven't showed me these
pictures before

516
00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:06.969
this is the first time l've seen em."

517
00:35:07.505 --> 00:35:08.802
And he said, "Well look at it."

518
00:35:08.873 --> 00:35:09.931
And l looked at it, and he says

519
00:35:10.308 --> 00:35:12.538
"l look like a goddamn piece of charcoal."

520
00:35:15.646 --> 00:35:17.671
Well l remember a time when l was six

521
00:35:17.882 --> 00:35:20.749
and l was hanging out at my great-
grandmother's home.

522
00:35:21.519 --> 00:35:24.750
And she's very white, very Spaniard, in her
appearance

523
00:35:25.423 --> 00:35:27.891
And l was hanging out with another kid,
who was my age

524
00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:29.824
a classmate who was black.

525
00:35:31.262 --> 00:35:32.627
And when we went to the house,

526
00:35:32.864 --> 00:35:36.425
l was so eager for him to try the
strawberry and chocolate grits.

527
00:35:36.767 --> 00:35:39.463
You know, in Spanish it's farina, or avena

528
00:35:39.804 --> 00:35:41.669
but in English, you know, it's the grits.

529
00:35:42.507 --> 00:35:44.475
And l remember my great-grandmother
telling me

530
00:35:44.542 --> 00:35:46.305
that he couldn't come into the house.

531
00:35:46.577 --> 00:35:47.737
But l didn't know why

532
00:35:47.812 --> 00:35:50.542
and l really didn't understand why until
later

533
00:35:50.615 --> 00:35:54.016
after l became more conscious and
reflecting back, why it was.

534
00:35:54.285 --> 00:35:56.810
And it was very simply because he was
black

535
00:35:57.288 --> 00:36:02.316
and she didn't want her house, her floor,
her presence, tinted by blackness

536
00:36:04.629 --> 00:36:08.588
l'm thinking of myself at age 1 4, you know

537
00:36:08.666 --> 00:36:10.327
hanging out in the flower shop.

538
00:36:10.935 --> 00:36:15.736
There's a white woman and a Latino
woman at the counter.

539
00:36:15.873 --> 00:36:17.864
The Latino woman was there first.

540
00:36:18.576 --> 00:36:21.477
And l choose to talk to the white woman.

541
00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:27.676
And then you lose your own humanity, you
know, because, you know,

542
00:36:27.752 --> 00:36:32.519
what's the humanity in treating someone
more poorly than another person?

543
00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:44.290
Very early on l noticed that there was one
other African American boy

544
00:36:44.368 --> 00:36:46.529
in the school and in my class.

545
00:36:46.637 --> 00:36:49.765
Brocelius was treated just like l was, that
is that

546
00:36:50.374 --> 00:36:53.468
none of the other boys and girls who were
white

547
00:36:57.348 --> 00:36:58.337
And so l remember

548
00:36:58.449 --> 00:37:03.079
there was one particular day, when he was
just trying to make friends.

549
00:37:03.354 --> 00:37:04.844
l don't really remember what it was,

550
00:37:04.922 --> 00:37:09.723
but l think it might've been in the
classroom during an art project.

551
00:37:10.461 --> 00:37:11.655
And he said, you know

552
00:37:11.729 --> 00:37:14.527
"Why don't you come on over? Why don't
we work on this with me?"

553
00:37:15.099 --> 00:37:19.001
And l said, "No, l'm not going to. No, l'm
not going to."

554
00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:20.537
And l walked away

555
00:37:20.605 --> 00:37:25.565
and he actually followed me in the room
and started to break out in tears

556
00:37:25.676 --> 00:37:30.045
because he knew, and l knew what l was
doing

557
00:37:30.448 --> 00:37:35.112
but deep down inside at that point, it was
real clear to me

558
00:37:35.386 --> 00:37:38.014
that he was somebody that l needed to
avoid

559
00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:43.048
l know that l get challenged more in the
classroom than my

560
00:37:43.527 --> 00:37:44.687
than my white colleagues.

561
00:37:45.029 --> 00:37:49.728
ln fact, l actually taught a class with a
white colleague, so it was right there

562
00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:50.926
We had the same set of students.

563
00:37:51.068 --> 00:37:52.763
We were in the class at the same time

564
00:37:53.037 --> 00:37:58.737
and l saw it day after day, that he would
say something

565
00:37:58.876 --> 00:38:01.845
and had to give very little explanation that
followed

566
00:38:02.146 --> 00:38:03.841
and they would all be fine with it.

567
00:38:04.715 --> 00:38:08.879
And before, l would, you know say, "Well
this is your assignment,"

568
00:38:08.986 --> 00:38:12.046
l'd have to make sure that l had everything
ready for

569
00:38:12.156 --> 00:38:13.714
"Why are you asking us to do this?"

570
00:38:13.824 --> 00:38:17.624
Being challenged on every level, with
grades, with assignments

571
00:38:18.129 --> 00:38:20.927
so from the point of view of internalized
racism

572
00:38:20.998 --> 00:38:24.627
l fall into the trap where l'm justifying

573
00:38:24.735 --> 00:38:26.066
and l'm bending over backwards

574
00:38:26.137 --> 00:38:30.403
and l have to remind myself that l'm here
because l have a expertise;

575
00:38:30.474 --> 00:38:33.671
l have the experience, that's why l'm the
instructor.

576
00:38:34.178 --> 00:38:38.740
l have to go there, because an automatic
reaction is to please

577
00:38:39.083 --> 00:38:43.417
to help them along, that's the internalized
racism is

578
00:38:43.521 --> 00:38:47.787
is not feeling that l'm , that l'm capable.

579
00:38:47.958 --> 00:38:49.118
But l am capable.

580
00:38:51.796 --> 00:38:54.697
When we look at American chattel slavery
which lasted for centuries

581
00:38:54.965 --> 00:38:56.728
we're always told, "Don't talk about it.

582
00:38:56.801 --> 00:38:58.769
Shut it down. Why? lt's over with now."

583
00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:03.600
And what l understand as a healer, as a
clinician, you know, and as an educator,

584
00:39:03.808 --> 00:39:05.173
is that it just doesn't go away.

585
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:06.836
So the question becomes

586
00:39:06.944 --> 00:39:08.145
what does it look like now?

587
00:39:08.145 --> 00:39:09.703
How did it get passed along?

588
00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:13.250
What are some of the symptoms of this
thing l'm talking about

589
00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:15.150
which l call post-traumatic slave
syndrome.

590
00:39:15.753 --> 00:39:17.778
But it becomes adaptive behavior

591
00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:20.889
things that lie just beneath the surface.

592
00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:25.052
For example, l give this example because
it's such a good one.

593
00:39:25.129 --> 00:39:27.529
l think people can kind of grasp it.

594
00:39:29.233 --> 00:39:30.894
There are certain things like sayings

595
00:39:30.968 --> 00:39:32.993
and things you grow up with that you just
take for granted.

596
00:39:33.137 --> 00:39:36.470
"Mama said it," or, "Big Daddy said it," or,
"Pookie," somebody said it,

597
00:39:36.607 --> 00:39:38.234
and it's just something you come to know.

598
00:39:38.609 --> 00:39:41.145
l'll give you an example that there is, let's
say that there are two people

599
00:39:41.145 --> 00:39:46.742
201 0, or in contemporary society that,
there're mother

600
00:39:46.851 --> 00:39:48.819
two mothers, white mother, black mother

601
00:39:48.919 --> 00:39:51.547
or it could be a white mother, a black
father, white father

602
00:39:51.622 --> 00:39:53.157
it doesn't matter, it's not gender specific.

603
00:39:53.157 --> 00:39:54.886
But you have these two individuals; they
have children.

604
00:39:55.192 --> 00:40:00.494
Say these two mother's have two sons,
and these two sons play together.

605
00:40:00.765 --> 00:40:01.732
They go to school together

606
00:40:01.799 --> 00:40:03.027
they spend a night over at each other's
house.

607
00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:04.965
They're best of friends, and they find
themselves

608
00:40:05.035 --> 00:40:08.027
the mothers and the two sons, at a school
meeting.

609
00:40:09.039 --> 00:40:12.610
The black mother and her son is seated
next to the white mother and her son

610
00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:14.771
and so, the black mother leans over and
says to the white mother

611
00:40:14.845 --> 00:40:18.281
"You know, your son's really doing well.
He's really coming along."

612
00:40:18.983 --> 00:40:20.678
And she goes, "Well thank you," and she
begins to say

613
00:40:20.851 --> 00:40:22.580
"Well did you know he's in the talented
and gifted

614
00:40:22.787 --> 00:40:24.277
and did you know he won the science fair

615
00:40:24.555 --> 00:40:26.022
and did you know his uncle was an
astronaut,"

616
00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:29.856
because she's oozing with pride,
wonderful thing.

617
00:40:30.561 --> 00:40:32.529
So then the white mother stops for a
moment and realizes

618
00:40:32.596 --> 00:40:35.929
that the black mother's son is actually
excelling her son.

619
00:40:36.767 --> 00:40:38.564
So she leans over to the black mother and
she goes

620
00:40:39.136 --> 00:40:41.570
"What are you talking about? My son!

621
00:40:41.806 --> 00:40:44.240
Now your son's the one that's really
coming along!"

622
00:40:44.909 --> 00:40:47.241
And the black mother's response is, "Girl,
get out of here.

623
00:40:47.611 --> 00:40:48.976
You should've seen that boy yesterday!

624
00:40:49.046 --> 00:40:52.743
Eew wee, he's , eew that boy is, eew he's
a handful. Stop it!"

625
00:40:53.651 --> 00:40:56.211
Now, the white mother's response is

626
00:40:56.287 --> 00:40:59.279
"Wow, they're so negative. No wonder,
why are they so negative?"

627
00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:02.916
Now, within our cultural adaptation and
norm

628
00:41:03.994 --> 00:41:07.555
if you're African American, not even just
African, you could be from the Caribbean.

629
00:41:07.798 --> 00:41:09.925
Black folks know that even though that
mother's going

630
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.935
"Girl get out of town, he's a mess," she's
really proud.

631
00:41:13.704 --> 00:41:17.640
Everyone knows that, sort of, except
maybe her son.

632
00:41:18.209 --> 00:41:21.042
So now let's take a look at this from a
different context

633
00:41:21.111 --> 00:41:24.103
because that's not healthy behavior, okay.

634
00:41:24.348 --> 00:41:27.647
And whether it's cultural or adaptive,
doesn't matter

635
00:41:27.718 --> 00:41:29.049
lt's not healthy behavior.

636
00:41:29.386 --> 00:41:30.717
Why isn't she praising him?

637
00:41:31.222 --> 00:41:33.087
Why isn't she oozing like the white
mother?

638
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:34.987
Well let's roll it back a couple centuries.

639
00:41:35.392 --> 00:41:40.728
And let's , now you have a black mother
that is seated, maybe at the table

640
00:41:41.699 --> 00:41:45.066
cutting up onions, or she's working in the
fields, and she's enslaved,

641
00:41:45.769 --> 00:41:47.031
and her children are with her.

642
00:41:47.304 --> 00:41:49.135
And a white slave owner comes over

643
00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:52.700
could be white woman, or white man, and
they say to that mother

644
00:41:53.677 --> 00:41:58.080
"My, my, now that boy, that boy there, he
sure coming along."

645
00:41:59.049 --> 00:42:01.347
What is she going to say? She gon' say

646
00:42:01.418 --> 00:42:05.912
"No sir, no sir. He shiftless, he can't work,
he stupid."

647
00:42:06.323 --> 00:42:08.018
'Cause l don't want you to sell my boy.

648
00:42:08.959 --> 00:42:11.621
lf it's my daughter, l don't want you to
breed her.

649
00:42:11.862 --> 00:42:14.854
So l denigrate them, to protect them.

650
00:42:15.032 --> 00:42:19.128
That is called appropriate adaptation to
living in a hostile environment.

651
00:42:19.303 --> 00:42:23.069
We never unlearned it, that's post-
traumatic slave syndrome.

652
00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:28.371
And while we continue to move on, and we
continue to even excel despite it all,

653
00:42:28.812 --> 00:42:30.837
there is some broken parts that we need
to fix

654
00:42:31.081 --> 00:42:32.742
and we can't fix it if we don't look.

655
00:42:52.937 --> 00:42:55.098
Can you point to in your own mind

656
00:42:56.073 --> 00:42:58.371
some of the ways that you are oppressed

657
00:42:59.276 --> 00:43:00.675
and oppressing?

658
00:43:01.912 --> 00:43:07.817
l remember when l really was on this,
making this journey

659
00:43:07.885 --> 00:43:09.409
and really making a commitment

660
00:43:09.987 --> 00:43:13.320
that l wanted to heal from the disease l
had termed racism.

661
00:43:14.959 --> 00:43:16.324
When you make a commitment like that

662
00:43:16.894 --> 00:43:19.954
nature has a way of providing you with all
kinds of opportunities

663
00:43:23.334 --> 00:43:25.734
So one day after work

664
00:43:26.236 --> 00:43:27.225
l picked up my daughter

665
00:43:27.838 --> 00:43:29.806
and we were on our way home.

666
00:43:30.007 --> 00:43:31.338
She says, "Let's go have Chinese food."

667
00:43:32.076 --> 00:43:36.308
So it was a Chinese restaurant right up the
street from where we lived.

668
00:43:37.181 --> 00:43:39.149
So she and l went into the restaurant

669
00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:41.308
waitresses was passing by us,

670
00:43:41.385 --> 00:43:43.046
and they, nobody was really stopping.

671
00:43:44.154 --> 00:43:46.816
And then l called one of them, l said

672
00:43:46.924 --> 00:43:48.721
"l'd like to get an order to go," and she
says

673
00:43:48.792 --> 00:43:51.488
"One moment." So she left, and she never
came back.

674
00:43:52.329 --> 00:43:54.263
So l was sitting there, ten minutes had
passed

675
00:43:54.331 --> 00:43:55.229
and l said, "Wait a minute."

676
00:43:55.499 --> 00:44:00.198
So finally, an elderly woman was at the
counter

677
00:44:00.304 --> 00:44:04.104
so l said, "Let me go up and talk to her."

678
00:44:04.875 --> 00:44:08.038
So l walked up to her, and l was just
reading some stuff off

679
00:44:08.112 --> 00:44:12.048
She wasn't writing anything down, and so l
finished my order

680
00:44:12.116 --> 00:44:15.517
and then she looked at me and she said,
"We don't serve you people."

681
00:44:17.821 --> 00:44:21.814
l looked at this woman, l said, "Look, you
know, it's okay."

682
00:44:22.426 --> 00:44:24.087
l said, "You don't have to serve me."

683
00:44:25.195 --> 00:44:28.460
l said, "But, l really want you to think about
what you're doing."

684
00:44:29.466 --> 00:44:31.866
l said, "There are all kinds of people in the
world."

685
00:44:32.436 --> 00:44:35.064
l said, "There are good black people and
bad black people.

686
00:44:35.139 --> 00:44:38.233
Good Chinese people and bad Chinese
people.

687
00:44:38.308 --> 00:44:39.866
Good white people and bad,"

688
00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:42.945
and l, it was like l was having an out of
body experience.

689
00:44:43.013 --> 00:44:45.243
l was looking deep into her eyes and she
was

690
00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:50.145
it was like l had captured her, and she was
listening.

691
00:44:50.254 --> 00:44:51.881
And l was sharing with her

692
00:44:51.955 --> 00:44:55.447
l said, "But, l just want you to think about
the message

693
00:44:55.893 --> 00:44:57.451
that you're sending to young people

694
00:44:58.429 --> 00:45:03.366
by saying you don't serve you people.
Who are you people?"

695
00:45:06.336 --> 00:45:07.530
When 9/11 happened

696
00:45:08.105 --> 00:45:11.871
l had a lot of context about the history of
racism in our country.

697
00:45:12.276 --> 00:45:18.044
And immediately l recognized there was
gonna be a shift in our society

698
00:45:18.315 --> 00:45:20.180
and there was gonna be a focus on our
community

699
00:45:20.284 --> 00:45:22.275
the Muslim community in the United
States.

700
00:45:22.619 --> 00:45:25.986
And there was going to be an enormous
amount of backlash.

701
00:45:26.256 --> 00:45:29.419
All of a sudden it became, "We are the
enemy."

702
00:45:30.227 --> 00:45:32.354
What l saw with a lot of white folks was

703
00:45:33.397 --> 00:45:38.300
Muslim people in this society went from
being completely unknown to

704
00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:41.163
"l have a very specific idea about who you
are."

705
00:45:41.572 --> 00:45:45.064
Muslim people are overwhelmingly viewed
to be people of color.

706
00:45:45.642 --> 00:45:49.339
And- And so as a result, there's a racial
dynamic there.

707
00:45:49.947 --> 00:45:51.380
And also l think it's been interesting

708
00:45:51.448 --> 00:45:54.975
because l think that there is a concerted
effort

709
00:45:55.052 --> 00:45:57.577
to make us foreign and the other

710
00:45:59.256 --> 00:46:01.952
Frank Rich, who again, is a fairly liberal
columnist

711
00:46:02.025 --> 00:46:04.255
and wrote a piece, l think it was in the
New York Times

712
00:46:04.328 --> 00:46:06.228
right after or right before the election

713
00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:07.588
where he said that, you know

714
00:46:07.664 --> 00:46:09.962
basically racism is not a problem anymore

715
00:46:10.067 --> 00:46:12.968
because when white folks get to know
black folks well

716
00:46:13.203 --> 00:46:14.966
their biases and their fears subside.

717
00:46:15.272 --> 00:46:17.137
Now, number one, l'm not sure that's true

718
00:46:17.207 --> 00:46:19.971
but secondly, even if it were true, the truth
is

719
00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:24.248
given the history of racism, spatial
segregation, residential isolation

720
00:46:24.248 --> 00:46:27.183
the fact that 85% of white folks live in
communities

721
00:46:27.251 --> 00:46:29.082
with virtually no people of color around

722
00:46:29.386 --> 00:46:30.410
even if he were right

723
00:46:30.654 --> 00:46:32.383
it wouldn't matter because most white
folks

724
00:46:32.456 --> 00:46:35.584
won't get that opportunity to actually form
close

725
00:46:36.093 --> 00:46:38.459
intimate friendships or connections with
people of color.

726
00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:41.530
And unfortunately, if it isn't happening

727
00:46:41.698 --> 00:46:44.531
the only way we get to know folks of color
is via media.

728
00:46:44.968 --> 00:46:47.232
So, maybe we see Barack Obama on
television

729
00:46:47.304 --> 00:46:48.965
coming into our living rooms every night

730
00:46:49.273 --> 00:46:51.901
and over a 18 month to two year period
we're able to say

731
00:46:51.975 --> 00:46:53.272
"Yeah you know, l sorta like that guy

732
00:46:53.377 --> 00:46:55.538
he seems really capable and really bright.

733
00:46:55.679 --> 00:46:59.479
Maybe l wasn't sure at first but given two
years he was able to overcome

734
00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:01.108
you know, maybe my first impression."

735
00:47:01.351 --> 00:47:03.319
But the only other folks we're seeing in the
media

736
00:47:03.587 --> 00:47:06.351
are either folks who are sort of superstars,
on the one hand

737
00:47:06.723 --> 00:47:08.315
or criminals on the other hand.

738
00:47:08.392 --> 00:47:10.917
Those are the black folks we typically see
on T.V.

739
00:47:11.195 --> 00:47:14.255
They're either like mega-millionaire
athletes or entertainers

740
00:47:14.464 --> 00:47:15.931
or they're the folks doing a perp walk

741
00:47:15.999 --> 00:47:18.695
on the 6 o'clock news, that the cops had
just gone arrested

742
00:47:19.002 --> 00:47:20.367
and haven't even let them put a shirt on

743
00:47:20.437 --> 00:47:23.133
before cuffing them and bringing them out
in front of the cameras.

744
00:47:26.176 --> 00:47:28.542
are superstar millionaires and thugs

745
00:47:29.012 --> 00:47:32.004
for the average person, they can't relate to
either of those, right?

746
00:47:32.149 --> 00:47:33.343
The average person of color can't

747
00:47:33.417 --> 00:47:35.078
and the average white person can't either.

748
00:47:38.388 --> 00:47:39.616
and the thug you're afraid of.

749
00:47:40.123 --> 00:47:42.591
And envy and fear are not particularly
good human emotions

750
00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.651
upon which to base some personal
connections or intimate relationships.

751
00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:47.697
So l think that's what we're dealing with,
you know

752
00:47:47.764 --> 00:47:51.427
Barack Obama, or Bill Cosby, or Oprah
Winfrey

753
00:47:51.501 --> 00:47:54.732
are a handful people of color, we're able to
get to know them

754
00:47:55.105 --> 00:47:57.130
or at least we think we know them, via
media.

755
00:47:57.374 --> 00:47:59.001
But for average everyday white folks

756
00:47:59.076 --> 00:48:00.634
and for average everyday black and brown
folks

757
00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:02.736
the ability to really get to know each other

758
00:48:03.046 --> 00:48:05.480
and overcome those implicit biases is a lot
more rare

759
00:48:11.555 --> 00:48:13.648
and somehow l ended up in this sociology
class

760
00:48:13.757 --> 00:48:16.282
where there were, it was a small class.

761
00:48:16.693 --> 00:48:21.130
lt was about maybe 1 50 students.

762
00:48:21.431 --> 00:48:24.594
And most classes were at least 4 and 500
students.

763
00:48:25.802 --> 00:48:29.169
And the professor was a WASP, and really

764
00:48:29.373 --> 00:48:32.774
growing up in the south, l really didn't
know what a WASP was, you know.

765
00:48:33.644 --> 00:48:39.708
And, and so the professor, the first day of
class, he said

766
00:48:40.083 --> 00:48:42.278
how many WASPs were in the classroom?

767
00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:44.653
And so l was looking around,

768
00:48:44.755 --> 00:48:49.692
'cause l was looking for this, like, wasp
that sting people.

769
00:48:52.696 --> 00:48:54.254
And so as l was looking around

770
00:48:54.331 --> 00:48:56.731
l saw people raising their hands.

771
00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:59.091
And finally l raised my hand.

772
00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:01.797
But l was raising my hand to ask a
question.

773
00:49:02.439 --> 00:49:04.771
And the professor knew l wasn't a WASP.

774
00:49:05.509 --> 00:49:08.103
So he looked at me, he said, "How may l
help you?"

775
00:49:08.679 --> 00:49:10.306
And then he said, "You!"

776
00:49:10.681 --> 00:49:14.674
And l said, "Yes, um, what is a WASP?"

777
00:49:15.619 --> 00:49:19.715
And so he looked at me with such disdain
and such venom

778
00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:24.727
he said, "White Anglo-Saxon Protestant, of
course."

779
00:49:24.828 --> 00:49:26.796
And then everybody in the class laughed

780
00:49:27.564 --> 00:49:30.465
and when they all laughed l was just like,
you know

781
00:49:31.568 --> 00:49:34.833
l felt horrible, and l sank down in my seat

782
00:49:35.205 --> 00:49:38.572
and that's when l realized that to speak
was not the right thing to do.

783
00:49:40.577 --> 00:49:45.810
That interpersonal level is when we're
making decisions,

784
00:49:47.751 --> 00:49:51.687
and what we're going to make possible or
not possible for them.

785
00:49:52.389 --> 00:49:55.688
That's when as a teacher, for example

786
00:49:55.859 --> 00:50:01.320
if you have a young black kid who's having
a hard time settling down

787
00:50:01.498 --> 00:50:04.296
you're making decisions based on your
beliefs

788
00:50:04.368 --> 00:50:08.361
about whether that kid needs a little bit
more attention

789
00:50:08.572 --> 00:50:12.406
or that kid needs to be sent to special
education

790
00:50:12.576 --> 00:50:18.208
or that kid needs to be expelled from the
school because he can't act right

791
00:51:19.209 --> 00:51:20.471
At the institutional level

792
00:51:20.544 --> 00:51:25.413
we see racism play out in the, both the
written rules

793
00:51:25.482 --> 00:51:28.679
and the unwritten rules of that institution.

794
00:51:29.419 --> 00:51:31.785
l went to Lionel Wilson College
Preparatory Academy.

795
00:51:32.255 --> 00:51:34.689
First high school built in Oakland in 40
years.

796
00:51:34.891 --> 00:51:38.850
Funded by many donations it was clearly
not no ghetto school.

797
00:51:39.329 --> 00:51:40.523
Though they placed us in the middle of
Sobrante Park

798
00:51:40.597 --> 00:51:41.791
East Oakland, on 1 05th.

799
00:51:41.865 --> 00:51:44.356
For those who missing this, that would be
the ghetto.

800
00:51:44.835 --> 00:51:46.826
So those who ran it were continuously
shocked and appalled

801
00:51:46.903 --> 00:51:48.495
at the daily tagging appearing in the halls.

802
00:51:48.572 --> 00:51:50.301
The block signs scraped into walls

803
00:51:50.373 --> 00:51:53.365
and the rocks tossed so frequently through
windows.

804
00:51:53.677 --> 00:51:54.905
What did they expect?

805
00:51:55.378 --> 00:51:56.811
Shudda known you can't take the ghetto
out a kid

806
00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.973
even if you place them in a clean cut
environment

807
00:51:59.249 --> 00:52:01.877
because they will do anything to remove
dissonance.

808
00:52:01.952 --> 00:52:04.386
So when you're used to crack vials lining
your walkways

809
00:52:04.454 --> 00:52:06.615
and everything you own is a step past
shitty

810
00:52:06.923 --> 00:52:08.982
you really ain't trying to see nothing pretty.

811
00:52:10.694 --> 00:52:13.993
A white boy who walks in the room, and is
animated

812
00:52:14.264 --> 00:52:16.960
and moving around, and maybe even a
little cheeky

813
00:52:17.534 --> 00:52:21.595
is smart, and, "lsn't he smart, isn't he
cheeky?"

814
00:52:21.671 --> 00:52:24.799
He's almost looked at as, "Well boys will
be boys."

815
00:52:26.443 --> 00:52:29.970
A child, a boy of color, especially an
African American boy

816
00:52:30.046 --> 00:52:33.015
who walks in the room exhibiting the same
behavior

817
00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:37.547
walks in and it's , "Hmm, l might need to
keep an eye on him."

818
00:52:37.754 --> 00:52:41.315
We are afraid, of these young boys

819
00:52:41.558 --> 00:52:45.255
and l'm talking young boys, four years-old
and above.

820
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:49.856
And that, instead of the teacher looking at
him or herself and saying

821
00:52:50.367 --> 00:52:51.959
"What is going on with me

822
00:52:52.402 --> 00:52:59.740
that this same behavior creates fear in me
instead of admiration?"

823
00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:02.471
We pathologize the boy of color.

824
00:53:03.313 --> 00:53:03.836
"Jumpshot!"

825
00:53:04.447 --> 00:53:06.608
"No, look, l just, l want to get over there."

826
00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:07.444
"Dance."

827
00:53:07.584 --> 00:53:10.382
"No listen, l, l just need to get over there."

828
00:53:10.887 --> 00:53:11.581
"Crack!"

829
00:53:11.655 --> 00:53:14.522
"No, l'm sorry look, l, l, l just want to get
over there."

830
00:53:14.658 --> 00:53:14.953
"Rap."

831
00:53:15.392 --> 00:53:17.417
"No, l need to get over there!"

832
00:53:17.494 --> 00:53:22.898
"Hey man show me your jumpshot! C'mon,
rap for me, c'mon.

833
00:53:25.068 --> 00:53:27.696
There was no place for us in school.

834
00:53:28.004 --> 00:53:30.336
l would argue that the greatest waste of
time in my life

835
00:53:30.407 --> 00:53:32.841
was the four years l spent in high school.

836
00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:34.877
And this is coming from an educator

837
00:53:35.612 --> 00:53:39.946
that there was, from the food we were fed

838
00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:44.443
to the only way we were really accepted in
school, you know.

839
00:53:44.521 --> 00:53:48.457
The black boys are the mascots of any
high school

840
00:53:48.525 --> 00:53:49.617
that they're in where l grew up.

841
00:53:49.693 --> 00:53:51.354
l don't know about other places

842
00:53:52.862 --> 00:53:57.856
l see it now at Universities where like the
black dudes are you know

843
00:53:57.934 --> 00:54:01.529
they're the provocative part of your
experience

844
00:54:01.938 --> 00:54:04.429
in high school or college or in the work
place, you know.

845
00:54:04.808 --> 00:54:07.971
And for me it just, it didn't speak to me.

846
00:54:09.713 --> 00:54:11.943
Race always deals with boxes, right?

847
00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:16.417
And l think when we are

848
00:54:18.888 --> 00:54:22.688
so let's say, you grow up in the suburbs,
you know?

849
00:54:22.759 --> 00:54:25.557
Or you grow up in an affluent area in a
city,

850
00:54:25.629 --> 00:54:27.688
that has an affluent area and a ghetto

851
00:54:29.399 --> 00:54:30.366
but you're black, a black boy.

852
00:54:33.403 --> 00:54:36.839
And you, so you get to school

853
00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:38.632
and there's a box for you.

854
00:54:38.742 --> 00:54:39.970
And that box says

855
00:54:40.477 --> 00:54:41.102
"you rap

856
00:54:42.612 --> 00:54:43.772
you're an athlete,

857
00:54:45.415 --> 00:54:50.648
you're slightly to highly misbehaved.

858
00:54:52.889 --> 00:54:56.381
You're not involved or into your education
that much.

859
00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.887
You sell and or use drugs."

860
00:54:59.763 --> 00:55:01.458
That's the box that you're accepted in.

861
00:55:03.199 --> 00:55:05.861
And in order to play ball, no pun intended

862
00:55:06.503 --> 00:55:09.028
That's how you interact with yourself, your
own identity

863
00:55:09.105 --> 00:55:10.800
and this is how you're cool.

864
00:55:12.008 --> 00:55:14.704
But you feel like, the box that it traps you
in

865
00:55:15.612 --> 00:55:20.174
if you feel like, to be healthier

866
00:55:21.551 --> 00:55:23.109
to be in a more sound mind state

867
00:55:23.186 --> 00:55:28.089
to think and know and come from a place
of foundation in your life

868
00:55:28.792 --> 00:55:30.555
is something that you have to be ashamed
of

869
00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:32.191
and you have to denounce

870
00:55:32.929 --> 00:55:34.658
it can drive you crazy.

871
00:55:37.934 --> 00:55:40.528
Boy is born.

872
00:55:42.539 --> 00:55:46.168
He's beautiful, as everyone is.

873
00:55:48.011 --> 00:55:51.845
He's brown, like his parents.

874
00:55:53.216 --> 00:55:54.581
He is loved.

875
00:55:56.219 --> 00:55:57.584
He grows.

876
00:56:00.123 --> 00:56:04.116
One day coming from school, cops stop
boy.

877
00:56:05.962 --> 00:56:07.691
Cops do not love boy.

878
00:56:08.832 --> 00:56:09.924
Tell boy so.

879
00:56:11.267 --> 00:56:12.598
Call him stupid.

880
00:56:13.136 --> 00:56:18.233
Bad, stupid. Ugly, brown, black, black,
brown, ugly.

881
00:56:18.508 --> 00:56:19.668
Call him stupid.

882
00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:22.943
Bad. Ugly.

883
00:56:24.814 --> 00:56:30.810
T.V. tells boy, what cop say, true.

884
00:56:32.822 --> 00:56:39.159
Teacher show boy, they believe what cop
say, true.

885
00:56:41.097 --> 00:56:45.090
News say, tube say, people say

886
00:56:45.168 --> 00:56:47.636
seem like even steeple say

887
00:56:48.138 --> 00:56:51.665
what cop say, true.

888
00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:54.702
Boy blue

889
00:56:55.712 --> 00:56:57.009
You know when l get the occasion

890
00:56:57.113 --> 00:56:59.775
and l don't get it very often to sit down

891
00:56:59.849 --> 00:57:02.283
and do trainings or workshops with law
enforcement officers

892
00:57:02.852 --> 00:57:03.978
one of the things that l do usually

893
00:57:04.087 --> 00:57:06.521
in the first five minutes is to ask them

894
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:08.657
you know, "What's the very first thing you
think

895
00:57:08.725 --> 00:57:10.283
when you see a young black or Latino
male

896
00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:13.522
driving a nice car in your community?"

897
00:57:13.797 --> 00:57:16.595
And almost invariably and with very few
exceptions

898
00:57:16.666 --> 00:57:19.760
including among the officers of color, they
will respond

899
00:57:19.903 --> 00:57:20.801
"Probably a drug dealer."

900
00:57:21.304 --> 00:57:22.965
l will then ask them, next question

901
00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:25.073
"When you see a young white male, same
age

902
00:57:25.275 --> 00:57:27.266
driving the same kind of car in your
community

903
00:57:27.577 --> 00:57:28.771
what is the first thing you think?"

904
00:57:28.845 --> 00:57:30.938
And almost every time, without exception

905
00:57:31.014 --> 00:57:34.245
including among the officers of color, they
will say

906
00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:36.648
"Spoiled little rich kid. Daddy probably
bought him a car."

907
00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:38.180
Now on the one level, you know

908
00:57:38.254 --> 00:57:40.279
we've been together for five minutes, me
and these cops

909
00:57:40.356 --> 00:57:42.847
we got a two hour workshop, three hour
workshop coming

910
00:57:42.992 --> 00:57:44.892
and they've already outed themselves
fundamentally

911
00:57:44.961 --> 00:57:48.124
as racist in the sense that they've
acknowledged their perception

912
00:57:48.231 --> 00:57:52.065
which is solely based on skin color, is one
that is negative toward

913
00:57:52.135 --> 00:57:53.625
in this case, black or brown kids.

914
00:57:54.137 --> 00:57:55.331
How is that going to manifest?

915
00:57:55.605 --> 00:57:56.902
Well logic tells you

916
00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:59.665
that if you're a police officer who has that
reaction

917
00:57:59.943 --> 00:58:01.934
you may not like the spoiled little rich kid
either.

918
00:58:02.011 --> 00:58:03.035
ln fact you probably don't .

919
00:58:03.346 --> 00:58:04.608
But you're not going to hassle him

920
00:58:04.681 --> 00:58:06.273
because you're afraid his daddy might
have some power.

921
00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:09.250
On the other hand, if you think the black or
brown kid is a dealer

922
00:58:09.652 --> 00:58:10.346
you're going to stop him.

923
00:58:10.987 --> 00:58:11.954
You're going to search him.

924
00:58:12.155 --> 00:58:14.851
You're probably not going to find anything
according to the data

925
00:58:14.924 --> 00:58:16.687
but now you're going to have his name in
the system.

926
00:58:16.993 --> 00:58:18.358
You're going to be on the lookout for his
car.

927
00:58:18.628 --> 00:58:21.654
You're able to in effect tag him as a
possible wrong doer

928
00:58:21.731 --> 00:58:23.596
and then, that's how these folks get
caught up

929
00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:26.100
young black and brown men in particular,

930
00:58:26.369 --> 00:58:28.030
in the system being harassed over and
over and over again

931
00:58:28.238 --> 00:58:30.229
while the white folks, according to the data

932
00:58:30.306 --> 00:58:32.365
are the ones more likely to have drugs in
their car

933
00:58:33.076 --> 00:58:35.772
more likely to bring drugs through airports.

934
00:58:35.845 --> 00:58:38.075
The ones who are the least suspected

935
00:58:38.147 --> 00:58:40.877
are the ones who are actually most likely
to be guilty

936
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:43.919
So you have the combination of personal
bias

937
00:58:44.787 --> 00:58:47.187
and the reality then of systemic
mistreatment

938
00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:50.750
and then the irony of it all, is it actually
leads you astray

939
00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:52.862
and doesn't allow you to do your job
effectively.

940
00:58:52.862 --> 00:58:55.296
lf you're a cop, thinks the black or brown
kids got drugs

941
00:58:55.365 --> 00:58:56.389
and the white kid has drugs

942
00:58:56.666 --> 00:58:57.894
you're not even doing your job well

943
00:58:58.101 --> 00:58:59.363
So at some level, you know

944
00:58:59.435 --> 00:59:02.927
these personal biases not only affect
systemic behavior

945
00:59:03.239 --> 00:59:06.697
but they actually have profound, larger,
social consequences

946
00:59:06.776 --> 00:59:08.403
in that our criminal justice resources

947
00:59:08.678 --> 00:59:11.647
are really deployed in the completely
wrong areas

948
00:59:19.923 --> 00:59:24.257
So a good example is our current
foreclosure crisis and the housing crisis.

949
00:59:25.161 --> 00:59:30.064
What happened there is that, 30, 40 years
ago

950
00:59:30.333 --> 00:59:34.326
you had banks making very explicit racial
decisions

951
00:59:34.437 --> 00:59:38.100
not to loan to people of color, and
particularly

952
00:59:38.207 --> 00:59:41.870
not to loan to people who are trying to
integrate neighborhoods.

953
00:59:42.011 --> 00:59:44.070
That kind of explicit racism

954
00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:47.707
was outlawed by the community
reinvestment act

955
00:59:47.784 --> 00:59:50.150
and by some other civil rights laws.

956
00:59:50.753 --> 00:59:53.415
But what came up in their place

957
00:59:53.823 --> 00:59:58.453
is a whole range of new financial
institutions.

958
00:59:58.728 --> 01:00:01.219
And those folks began to make

959
01:00:01.297 --> 01:00:04.232
what are now known as, subprime loans

960
01:00:04.767 --> 01:00:07.031
and they went to the communities

961
01:00:07.136 --> 01:00:10.765
that had very little access to traditional
mortgages.

962
01:00:11.341 --> 01:00:17.769
Their behavior, their lending practices,
created a racist impact;

963
01:00:17.847 --> 01:00:20.179
it created a tremendous lost of wealth

964
01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:24.083
and a huge foreclosure crisis in
communities of color

965
01:00:24.487 --> 01:00:29.083
but we couldn't address it because they
weren't saying, explicitly

966
01:00:29.258 --> 01:00:32.284
"We're targeting these people because of
their race."

967
01:00:32.862 --> 01:00:37.322
So, we need to have a sense of racism

968
01:00:37.533 --> 01:00:41.367
as it works through our rules and
regulations,

969
01:00:41.504 --> 01:00:44.337
or our lack of rules and regulations

970
01:00:45.508 --> 01:00:52.414
even if no one is intentionally trying to be
racist.

971
01:01:06.129 --> 01:01:10.327
There is, a sort of seductive myth

972
01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:14.894
and undercurrent of this whole idea of
post-raciality that

973
01:01:14.971 --> 01:01:19.340
like, the answer is, everyone should have,
you know

974
01:01:19.442 --> 01:01:22.172
relationships across race and then
everything is gonna go away.

975
01:01:22.578 --> 01:01:24.273
Particularly in the Bay, you know, you get
that.

976
01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:27.144
You see a lot of couples who are raced
differently.

977
01:01:28.184 --> 01:01:30.243
and there's lots of beautiful babies
everywhere.

978
01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.044
And so some people would point to that as
like

979
01:01:32.155 --> 01:01:34.953
hey, mountain top, here we are.

980
01:01:36.392 --> 01:01:37.188
And l think that

981
01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:40.327
so often we talk about the interpersonal
when it comes to race

982
01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:43.525
when we need to be talking about the
structural also.

983
01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:48.129
ln all the social justice work l've done

984
01:01:48.404 --> 01:01:52.101
as l look at who is making the decision
about

985
01:01:52.175 --> 01:01:56.077
that transportation project, that job-training
program.

986
01:01:56.379 --> 01:02:01.214
Very rarely, do the people who are making
the decisions

987
01:02:01.951 --> 01:02:07.355
come from the communities that those
decisions are going to impact.

988
01:02:09.125 --> 01:02:12.253
So they are not representative of those
communities

989
01:02:13.129 --> 01:02:15.063
and more often than not

990
01:02:15.431 --> 01:02:18.594
they're also not even responsive to those
communities.

991
01:02:19.068 --> 01:02:22.560
l really became so focused on

992
01:02:23.306 --> 01:02:26.867
the different access to resources and
opportunities

993
01:02:27.143 --> 01:02:31.375
that different people have, and how that
influences

994
01:02:31.447 --> 01:02:34.507
what happens generation after generation
after generation.

995
01:02:34.917 --> 01:02:37.249
What makes places the places that they
are?

996
01:02:37.386 --> 01:02:41.220
And who decided that, and where's the
money going?

997
01:02:42.525 --> 01:02:44.015
At the structural level

998
01:02:44.127 --> 01:02:46.118
you're understanding the relationship

999
01:02:46.195 --> 01:02:48.993
between those different kinds of
institutions.

1000
01:02:49.165 --> 01:02:54.068
So, you understand that housing
segregation, for example

1001
01:02:54.303 --> 01:02:58.899
affects school financing, and so, housing
segregation

1002
01:02:58.975 --> 01:03:02.911
is going to generate segregation in
schools

1003
01:03:02.979 --> 01:03:07.939
and it's gonna generate uneven education
for kids of color.

1004
01:03:08.017 --> 01:03:12.113
And so if you only try to intervene in
education

1005
01:03:12.188 --> 01:03:13.951
with the education institutions

1006
01:03:14.323 --> 01:03:17.121
you're only gonna make limited progress
because we know

1007
01:03:17.193 --> 01:03:21.027
that the housing institutions also affect
what happens in schools.

1008
01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:26.933
l like the idea of living in a multi-racial
community

1009
01:03:27.003 --> 01:03:30.404
so that my children can get to know lots of
different people

1010
01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:33.441
and feel comfortable in all these different
cultures

1011
01:03:33.676 --> 01:03:35.940
and be able to go out into the world
comfortable with that.

1012
01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:39.079
But on the other hand, l'm also
challenged,

1013
01:03:39.182 --> 01:03:43.346
because l really need my child to have a
really good education.

1014
01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.054
And so in order to have a good education

1015
01:03:46.622 --> 01:03:49.614
they need to live in a neighborhood where
they can go to a good school.

1016
01:03:50.226 --> 01:03:51.955
And a good school is determined

1017
01:03:52.094 --> 01:03:57.555
by how much tax that school is able to
collect.

1018
01:03:58.267 --> 01:04:00.167
And l have to make choices about that

1019
01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:03.165
so then, say l make the decision to buy a
house

1020
01:04:03.239 --> 01:04:06.265
in a good neighborhood so my child has a
good education.

1021
01:04:06.576 --> 01:04:10.034
Chances are that neighborhood is less
racially diverse.

1022
01:04:10.546 --> 01:04:13.276
Then that means that my child will not
have

1023
01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:17.284
the same kinds of interracial experiences
growing up

1024
01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:22.221
that l had living in a city when my parents
had fewer choices

1025
01:04:22.558 --> 01:04:26.517
that were related to my fathers
immigration status, or not status

1026
01:04:26.596 --> 01:04:28.257
but the fact that he was an immigrant

1027
01:04:30.199 --> 01:04:34.397
and that it was harder for him to find good
work

1028
01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:36.399
which limited where we could live.

1029
01:04:37.607 --> 01:04:39.700
l may value racial diversity

1030
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:43.975
but given that wealth and access to
schooling

1031
01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:47.638
is so closely linked to home-ownership in
this society

1032
01:04:48.317 --> 01:04:52.515
l don't have to be racist in the traditional
sense of the word

1033
01:04:52.588 --> 01:04:55.489
of not liking somebody who's not like
myself

1034
01:04:57.326 --> 01:05:00.261
to actually be carrying on that tradition.

1035
01:05:01.764 --> 01:05:04.733
Structural racism, you know, the first part
of it is

1036
01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.166
that you're looking multiple institutions

1037
01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:10.231
and you're looking at the culture

1038
01:05:10.506 --> 01:05:13.498
the morals, the aspirations

1039
01:05:13.643 --> 01:05:16.339
the ideas, the language

1040
01:05:16.479 --> 01:05:17.639
the images,

1041
01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:20.774
all of those things that comprise a culture

1042
01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:22.718
but the other parts are that,

1043
01:05:22.718 --> 01:05:25.346
you're paying very serious attention to
history

1044
01:05:25.788 --> 01:05:28.382
because that's the way structural racism
works

1045
01:05:28.457 --> 01:05:29.685
that history matters.

1046
01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.091
So l'm 21 , right

1047
01:05:32.161 --> 01:05:37.258
and l find out that there's this distant
relative of mine,

1048
01:05:37.366 --> 01:05:41.496
who, once upon a time, was the governor
of Mississippi.

1049
01:05:42.305 --> 01:05:47.038
J.P. Coleman, he's the governor between
1 956 and 1960.

1050
01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:52.714
Mind you, he was elected into office four
months after Brown ll.

1051
01:05:53.382 --> 01:05:55.475
And one of the first things he did

1052
01:05:55.551 --> 01:05:57.485
was set up the state sovereignty
commission

1053
01:05:57.553 --> 01:05:59.544
and sort of be in cahoots with the citizens
council

1054
01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:07.359
and try to use the law to preserve
Mississippi's way of life

1055
01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:13.091
to subvert Brown through aracial legalistic
means.

1056
01:06:16.572 --> 01:06:20.736
ln the archives l was reading this letter
that, to me, echoed

1057
01:06:20.843 --> 01:06:26.645
of a sort of Ward Connerly colorblind
approach to the law

1058
01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:33.452
as a way to ensure that racialized
hierarchies of power

1059
01:06:34.790 --> 01:06:36.485
continue and are upheld.

1060
01:06:38.427 --> 01:06:41.294
And the letter was basically one of, you
know

1061
01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:47.733
in 1956 Mississippi, looking to remove the
language of race from the law,

1062
01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:50.662
so as to maintain segregated schools.

1063
01:06:52.141 --> 01:06:54.200
ln my opinion it was, you know, incredibly
insidious

1064
01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:56.801
but also what made it so that by the end of
his term

1065
01:06:58.581 --> 01:06:59.707
there were still separate schools.

1066
01:07:00.316 --> 01:07:03.285
The reality is if you're not part of the power
structure

1067
01:07:03.719 --> 01:07:05.778
you're not one of the ones making the
decision

1068
01:07:07.456 --> 01:07:10.254
l think you're hyper-aware of what's
happening.

1069
01:07:10.393 --> 01:07:13.658
You're hyper-aware of the decisions that
are being made

1070
01:07:13.729 --> 01:07:15.196
and how they impact you

1071
01:07:15.798 --> 01:07:21.134
and for the folks who are in positions of
power, they're not

1072
01:07:21.604 --> 01:07:22.662
they don't need to think about it.

1073
01:07:22.738 --> 01:07:25.866
They don't need to critique it, it works for
them.

1074
01:07:27.543 --> 01:07:31.274
As long as we're being taught that where
you end up is about your effort

1075
01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:34.310
then the fact of inequality between groups
of people,

1076
01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:36.712
is gonna come to be seen as natural
evidence

1077
01:07:37.186 --> 01:07:40.314
of some people's superiority, and other
people's inferiority.

1078
01:07:40.623 --> 01:07:42.215
Because if you don't educate folks

1079
01:07:42.391 --> 01:07:44.188
because you figure it's just wasting money.

1080
01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:47.793
lf you don't provide equal job opportunity
or equal housing opportunity

1081
01:07:48.264 --> 01:07:50.664
and you don't really care if there's
disproportionate incarceration

1082
01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:53.701
because you think "those folks are all bad
anyway,"

1083
01:07:54.236 --> 01:07:56.864
then you create this sort of snowball affect

1084
01:07:57.206 --> 01:07:59.640
where the uneducated and those who
can't find housing

1085
01:07:59.775 --> 01:08:00.935
and those who can't find jobs

1086
01:08:01.544 --> 01:08:03.910
will almost invariably have to find
someway to survive

1087
01:08:03.979 --> 01:08:06.243
and that will involve in some cases
criminal activity

1088
01:08:06.515 --> 01:08:07.709
which then will land them in jail.

1089
01:08:07.817 --> 01:08:08.681
When they get out of jail

1090
01:08:08.984 --> 01:08:11.248
60% of employers say they won't hire
anyone

1091
01:08:11.387 --> 01:08:13.355
who they know to be an ex-con, right?

1092
01:08:13.622 --> 01:08:16.420
So ultimately, we sort of keep this system
in place

1093
01:08:16.692 --> 01:08:20.355
by a combination of actual practices in the
job market

1094
01:08:20.429 --> 01:08:21.453
the school system, etc.

1095
01:08:21.764 --> 01:08:25.495
But also the underlying ideological glue of
the society.

1096
01:08:27.636 --> 01:08:33.506
The system of inequity is embedded in
history, culture, and identity.

1097
01:08:34.276 --> 01:08:37.712
lt has internal components and external
components.

1098
01:08:38.614 --> 01:08:44.678
These components are moved or
influenced by power and economics.

1099
01:08:45.554 --> 01:08:46.851
The internal components

1100
01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:52.553
consist of bias, privilege, and internalized
racism.

1101
01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:54.861
The external components

1102
01:08:55.531 --> 01:08:57.260
play out in relationships

1103
01:08:57.533 --> 01:09:01.867
which are interpersonal, institutional, and
structural.

1104
01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:05.697
All of these layers are happening
simultaneously.

1105
01:09:06.842 --> 01:09:09.640
And they are churning out inequities.

1106
01:09:11.447 --> 01:09:13.608
At the level of structures and institutions

1107
01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:15.775
we don't talk about division of resources.

1108
01:09:15.851 --> 01:09:19.912
We don't talk about larger structures of
schooling and workforce.

1109
01:09:20.356 --> 01:09:21.983
We don't talk about the whole system of
racism

1110
01:09:22.424 --> 01:09:23.516
and that's the problem.

1111
01:09:24.527 --> 01:09:26.358
What we owe to ourselves and each other

1112
01:09:26.695 --> 01:09:31.257
is to have authentic, clear conversations

1113
01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:34.032
We could actually get to somewhere so
fundamental

1114
01:09:34.603 --> 01:09:37.265
that the needs of human beings are more
important

1115
01:09:37.339 --> 01:09:38.499
than the desire for profit.

1116
01:09:38.574 --> 01:09:40.633
Or that our individual good

1117
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:44.277
is not above the common good, that we
actually work together.

1118
01:09:44.513 --> 01:09:47.616
What a bold and exciting way to organize
your society.

1119
01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:02.694
l like to go see movies.

1120
01:10:02.765 --> 01:10:03.891
Everybody knows l'm a movie person.

1121
01:10:04.333 --> 01:10:06.631
But l always go to see movies that aren't

1122
01:10:06.802 --> 01:10:08.667
They're just fantastic, kind of

1123
01:10:08.737 --> 01:10:10.534
you know, cinematography stuff.

1124
01:10:10.806 --> 01:10:14.799
l don't want reality, 'cause l deal too much
with reality

1125
01:10:15.511 --> 01:10:18.309
At this particular time it was King Kong, my
fault, l own it

1126
01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:20.371
l go to see King Kong, and the only reason
why l,

1127
01:10:20.449 --> 01:10:22.349
you know, of course l had seen it, the
earlier versions.

1128
01:10:22.418 --> 01:10:25.410
But the cinematography for this new one
was phenomenal

1129
01:10:25.521 --> 01:10:27.318
all the mechanics, and all the new stuff.

1130
01:10:27.389 --> 01:10:28.879
King Kong was doing all kinds of amazing
stuff.

1131
01:10:29.024 --> 01:10:30.013
So l decided l was gonna go.

1132
01:10:30.826 --> 01:10:32.817
So l'm in, l don't know, Baltimore

1133
01:10:32.928 --> 01:10:33.917
l don't know where l am, traveling.

1134
01:10:34.496 --> 01:10:35.861
And l'm with this friend of mine name
Dennis.

1135
01:10:35.998 --> 01:10:36.657
So we go in.

1136
01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:40.462
l didn't realize the movie was three hours,
first of all.

1137
01:10:40.603 --> 01:10:42.696
l had to go to the bathroom when l got in,
so l had to get out.

1138
01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:45.703
So l'm trying to figure out, when during the
movie do l run out.

1139
01:10:46.375 --> 01:10:49.833
So l decided it's a big bug scene, Jurassic
bugs.

1140
01:10:49.912 --> 01:10:52.039
l don't like little bugs, certainly don't like
big ones.

1141
01:10:52.147 --> 01:10:53.739
So l decided this is a good time to run out.

1142
01:10:53.849 --> 01:10:56.409
So l run out, and as l'm running out, this
young-

1143
01:10:56.552 --> 01:10:58.383
This is like the first day of opening

1144
01:10:58.454 --> 01:11:00.354
so there's like five theatres of King Kong.

1145
01:11:00.723 --> 01:11:02.782
So this guy runs out with his son, white
man

1146
01:11:02.891 --> 01:11:05.985
he's like mid-30s and he's got his son,
looks about eight or ten.

1147
01:11:06.428 --> 01:11:07.452
So they're running out and l'm going

1148
01:11:07.563 --> 01:11:10.657
"Whoa, that was out of control. The bug
scene."

1149
01:11:10.766 --> 01:11:12.461
He goes, "Oh boy was it!"

1150
01:11:12.668 --> 01:11:15.501
l said, "Yeah, that was clearly the worst
part so far."

1151
01:11:15.938 --> 01:11:19.066
So the father runs in, but his son stops
and goes

1152
01:11:20.042 --> 01:11:21.703
"Yeah l didn't like those black people."

1153
01:11:22.544 --> 01:11:24.637
And l'm going, "Why me? ls it me?

1154
01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:27.442
Do l have like a sign on me?" Right!

1155
01:11:27.583 --> 01:11:29.073
And then the kid runs in the bathroom.

1156
01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:32.512
So l go back in the show, and l say, tell
Dennis what just happened

1157
01:11:32.655 --> 01:11:33.644
and Dennis falls out laughing

1158
01:11:33.722 --> 01:11:34.984
he goes, "Joy this only happens to you."

1159
01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:39.655
And l'm going, "But l just," because there's
a scene, where there-

1160
01:11:39.762 --> 01:11:40.763
And here's the thing about it

1161
01:11:40.763 --> 01:11:41.695
this is so amazing about the scene.

1162
01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:43.591
There's a scene of cannibals

1163
01:11:44.667 --> 01:11:45.429
They're all kind of people.

1164
01:11:45.534 --> 01:11:47.434
And they're, you know right, they got to be
politically correct.

1165
01:11:47.503 --> 01:11:48.128
So you had Asians

1166
01:11:48.203 --> 01:11:49.693
and they zoomed in so you could see

1167
01:11:49.772 --> 01:11:53.401
even the main character was a blonde
woman with blue eyes.

1168
01:11:53.676 --> 01:11:55.667
But they're physically, were all black

1169
01:11:55.911 --> 01:11:57.845
even though they represented different
ethnicities.

1170
01:11:57.913 --> 01:11:59.847
'Cause you know, they couldn't have all
black people in there

1171
01:11:59.915 --> 01:12:01.610
not in, you know, this age.

1172
01:12:02.184 --> 01:12:04.880
But the little boy, he couldn't see that
subtlety.

1173
01:12:05.487 --> 01:12:08.684
So l'm sitting there, now upset, 'cause l
couldn't process.

1174
01:12:08.957 --> 01:12:11.152
And Dennis goes, "Joy you can't process
this, it's over.

1175
01:12:11.226 --> 01:12:12.557
lt's done. There are thousands of people.

1176
01:12:12.628 --> 01:12:13.822
You're never going to be able to fix this."
Right

1177
01:12:13.896 --> 01:12:14.191
So l'm sitting here

1178
01:12:14.463 --> 01:12:15.828
l'm messed up for the rest of the movie.

1179
01:12:16.932 --> 01:12:18.194
So the movie is over

1180
01:12:18.467 --> 01:12:21.493
we walk out, and there are droves of
people coming out.

1181
01:12:21.904 --> 01:12:25.135
And who do you think is standing there
leaning on the rail,

1182
01:12:25.607 --> 01:12:26.869
was this man and his son.

1183
01:12:27.543 --> 01:12:29.170
And l say "Dennis, this is the man."

1184
01:12:29.645 --> 01:12:30.907
He goes, "No way!"

1185
01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:32.947
l say, "Yes way. That's him!"

1186
01:12:33.248 --> 01:12:36.149
So l walk over to the man and l said, "Do
you remember me?"

1187
01:12:36.218 --> 01:12:38.083
He says, "Yeah, you ran out during the
bug scene."

1188
01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.545
Well they were waiting for the daughter to
come out of the bathroom.

1189
01:12:40.689 --> 01:12:41.986
That's why they were leaning and waiting
at the rail.

1190
01:12:42.057 --> 01:12:44.082
l said, "Can l ask your son something?"

1191
01:12:44.793 --> 01:12:45.725
He says, "Certainly."

1192
01:12:46.595 --> 01:12:47.926
So l say to the little boy, l said

1193
01:12:47.996 --> 01:12:50.089
"You know, now that you've seen the
whole movie,"

1194
01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:53.058
you know, because King Kong bites it in
the end

1195
01:12:53.135 --> 01:12:54.124
l'm figuring that's pretty bad.

1196
01:12:54.269 --> 01:12:56.999
l say, "What do you think the worst part of
the movie was now?"

1197
01:12:57.072 --> 01:12:59.199
He goes, "Those black people."

1198
01:12:59.675 --> 01:13:00.198
And his father goes

1199
01:13:00.676 --> 01:13:01.870
"Whoa." You know.

1200
01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:06.640
"Uh, uh, you know, l'm sure, well, yeah-
ahhh, they were."

1201
01:13:06.815 --> 01:13:07.907
You know he was so, the father

1202
01:13:08.016 --> 01:13:10.610
l said, "Listen l know your son is not a
Nazi, don't worry about it.

1203
01:13:10.786 --> 01:13:11.775
That, that's not what the issue is."

1204
01:13:11.854 --> 01:13:13.082
And the son runs off, l said

1205
01:13:13.655 --> 01:13:16.123
"The issue here is that, they weren't all
black people.

1206
01:13:16.191 --> 01:13:17.590
But that's his image, because you see

1207
01:13:17.659 --> 01:13:19.559
it wasn't the monsters that are horrific

1208
01:13:19.661 --> 01:13:20.628
it was those people were.

1209
01:13:20.763 --> 01:13:21.991
And that's the image in his mind

1210
01:13:22.598 --> 01:13:24.498
and he's so young, he couldn't see that

1211
01:13:24.566 --> 01:13:28.093
they were actually different groups of
people as those cannibals.

1212
01:13:28.170 --> 01:13:29.694
He only saw black people."

1213
01:13:30.105 --> 01:13:32.096
And his father, you could just see he was
tortured.

1214
01:13:32.708 --> 01:13:35.871
He says, "l, l just," he says, "l don't know.

1215
01:13:35.944 --> 01:13:38.913
This problem is so big l don't know if we
could ever make it right."

1216
01:13:39.815 --> 01:13:42.682
And l said, "You see, now we're having
another conversation," he and l.

1217
01:13:42.851 --> 01:13:45.684
He goes, "lt's just so big, l don't know if we
can make it right."

1218
01:13:46.755 --> 01:13:49.986
l said, "Perhaps." l said, "l have to believe
that we can."

1219
01:13:53.829 --> 01:13:55.626
and now he has his son and his daughter

1220
01:13:55.798 --> 01:13:58.130
and he's disturbed though, you can tell.

1221
01:13:58.767 --> 01:13:59.756
And he's walking away

1222
01:13:59.935 --> 01:14:01.766
and Dennis looks at me, and l look at
Dennis

1223
01:14:02.571 --> 01:14:05.734
and he gets to the escalator, and he stops

1224
01:14:06.642 --> 01:14:07.836
and he takes both of his children

1225
01:14:08.010 --> 01:14:09.773
and he turns around, and he walks back to
me.

1226
01:14:09.912 --> 01:14:12.574
And he says, "But l will make it right with
them

1227
01:14:14.183 --> 01:14:15.707
because l can make it right with them."

1228
01:14:16.852 --> 01:14:19.252
You see, that's , that's where the healing
begins

1229
01:14:19.721 --> 01:14:23.350
You know. That's where. Those moments.

1230
01:14:26.094 --> 01:14:32.795
Looking well in these books l see

1231
01:14:33.235 --> 01:14:38.798
nothing in them rings a bell.

1232
01:14:39.975 --> 01:14:45.140
Oh how l wish they'd speak to me

1233
01:14:45.747 --> 01:14:51.242
and my grandmother with the stories she'd
tell

1234
01:14:52.187 --> 01:14:58.148
My family has refrained you see,

1235
01:14:58.627 --> 01:15:04.259
from causing up a stir

1236
01:15:04.933 --> 01:15:10.371
They've been trained not to mention all the
rape and the death

1237
01:15:11.073 --> 01:15:16.272
making my history just a blur

1238
01:15:17.112 --> 01:15:22.982
So perhaps that is why you feel no shame,

1239
01:15:23.218 --> 01:15:28.622
just giving me one page

1240
01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:34.390
Erasing the source of my family's real
name,

1241
01:15:34.696 --> 01:15:38.826
to prevent me from tracing their rage

1242
01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:41.059
And you ask me why

1243
01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:44.969
there's hopelessness and there's
blindness

1244
01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:50.979
in the young ghetto children's eye.

1245
01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:57.046
Well any strong tree uplifted and stripped
of roots,

1246
01:15:57.719 --> 01:16:02.349
eventually will wither and die

1247
01:16:02.891 --> 01:16:08.352
Yes any strong tree uplifted and stripped
of roots,

1248
01:16:08.897 --> 01:16:15.132
eventually will wither and die

1249
01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:21.773
And looking within these books l see,

1250
01:16:22.177 --> 01:16:27.012
nothing in them rings a bell

1251
01:16:28.884 --> 01:16:33.844
Oh how l wish they'd speak to me..

1252
01:16:34.323 --> 01:16:39.955
and my grandmother with the stories she'd
tell

1253
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:47.928
Oh how l wish they spoke to me..

1254
01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:56.708
and my grandmother with the stories she'd
tell

1255
01:16:56.945 --> 01:17:00.278
Heya, heyya,

1256
01:17:00.816 --> 01:17:02.750
ho metquiasin,

1257
01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:11.723
Freedom, oh freedom,

1258
01:17:12.294 --> 01:17:18.824
can you imagine that?

1259
01:17:20.435 --> 01:17:27.932
Freedom oh freedom,

1260
01:17:28.377 --> 01:17:35.749
can you imagine that?

1261
01:17:36.385 --> 01:17:38.012
To make a job,

1262
01:17:38.086 --> 01:17:40.077
not just take a job,

1263
01:17:40.255 --> 01:17:44.282
to love the work l do

1264
01:17:44.926 --> 01:17:48.123
Happiness, togetherness,

1265
01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:55.395
with love from me or to you

1266
01:17:56.371 --> 01:17:58.271
To lift up your voice,

1267
01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:00.501
to shout and sing,

1268
01:18:01.009 --> 01:18:04.501
until we have and heaven rings,

1269
01:18:04.846 --> 01:18:08.942
with harmony, with liberty,

1270
01:18:09.117 --> 01:18:16.319
from sea to shining sea

1271
01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:22.430
Free. . .freedom. Freedom. . .oh... freedom

1272
01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:30.267
Oh. . .can you. . ..Can you imagine that?

1273
01:18:32.507 --> 01:18:39.003
Freedom. . .oh freedom,

1274
01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:46.048
Can you imagine that?

1275
01:18:48.123 --> 01:18:52.219
Take some pride in yourself. . .in yourself

1276
01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:56.262
Believe in yourself,

1277
01:18:56.364 --> 01:19:00.164
Take pride, take pride. . . in yourself,

1278
01:19:00.368 --> 01:19:04.065
Have faith in yourself,

1279
01:19:05.207 --> 01:19:11.578
Have freedom. . .faith in. . .oh. . .freedom,

01:19:11.913 --> 01:19:18.443
Oh freedom. . .can you imagine that?

Can you imagine freedom?

1282
01:19:22.891 --> 01:19:27.521
Can you imagine?. . .Oh freedom,
