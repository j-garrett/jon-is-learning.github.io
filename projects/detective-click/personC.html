        <p>Hello. I see you're the one who's supposed to solve this mystery isn't it? I tell you, the only mystery is how she lived so long! My mother was a dear, but she was also dearly old. As wrinkly as she was lovely.</p>
	<p>This was her favorite room you know. She would come in here and read for hours. Sometimes all she read was the spine of the books, trailing her fingers slowly over each letter visible while the book was shelved. She would shut her eyes and when I'd ask what she was doing she would say, "Just dreaming, dear. Just dreaming."</p>
	<p>I loved my mother. This room reminds me of her and with her memory I do what paltry thing I can do to keep her alive for just a while longer.</p>
