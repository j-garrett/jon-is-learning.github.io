	<p>This baby is watching a movie about a killer confessing to his crimes. She sees you approaching and turns it off.</p>
	<p>"How can I help you detective? I don't have too much to offer. She burped me and put me down for a nap. That was the last time I saw that sweet, sweet, Applebottom."
	<p>"Please, continue your search. When you find the bastard, please record the confession. I want to watch him break."</p>
