       <p>There's a side door. You can see inside it to the hallway, but the door is locked. Sure, you could break the glass and go in, but you're a detective not a thief. Besides, have you tried the front door yet? It looks like maybe it's at the end of the hall there. Seriously, why are you skulking around in the garden before even introducing yourself? Get your head in the game, buddy.</p>

        <p>Wow, you've worked so hard and for so long and you have to go back to the start. Well, not all the way back to your office at least. That would be a bummer. It's a four hour drive and it's hot out and the AC in your car is broken. I guess going back to the start isn't so bad if you keep it in perspective.</p>
