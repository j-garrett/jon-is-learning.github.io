	<h3>Police Detective</h3>

        <img src="img/personB.jpg"/>
	<p>The police had sent over a detective of their own. She looked sharp. Her tie was a snake and her eyes said she'd seen it all before. She'd been working the case and knew a whole lot, but wanted to get your perspective on it. Lord knows why, you just woke up from a four day drunk and still had the smell of rye coming out your pores. You were a mess, but here was a chance for redemption.
        <p>"We think someone in this house killed Gene Applebottom. We need your help getting to da bottom of this. You used to be good. Word's going around that you ain't that anymore. Ain't good."</p>
	<p>"I've put in a lot of hours on this. Maybe two to three whole ones with a minimum of snoozing. You take a look around and tell me what you think we got. If we're in agreement we'll book that perp right now."</p>

	</a>


	<a href="guiltyE.html">
		<p>"So you think it's the weird guy we picked up nearby?"</p>
	</a>


	<a href="guiltyF.html">

	</a>


	<a href="1foyer.html">
		<p>"Whadaya mean you did it?! You never heard of this family before today I bet. Get outta here, you crazy mug."</p>
