    <h3>Return to Foyer?</h3>

       <p>It's called foyer, but pronounced foy YAY. This is because you'll have a blast if you go back there. Don't go looking into doors or chests that are none of your business. I know this isn't a picture of the foyer. You'll have to keep using your imagination. I'll help: you look back to the foyer, but can't see the room and the people huddled inside dramatically because of the giant, hill-like staircase taking up your view. There. You're welcome.</p>

<div class="location2">
    <h3>Chest</h3>

        <p>There's a chest at the end of the hall. It probably has something private inside, but there might also be evidence in there. Disregard a person's right to privacy and you may get the clue you desire!</p>

<div class="location3">
    <h3>Bathroom</h3>

        </a>
	<p>Finally, a place to relieve yourself. It's been a long day, hasn't it? You had to drive over here in your beaten up Dodge. A several hour drive wouldn't have been so bad if only the AC was working. At least your radio still works. The AM channels at least... Why are we talking about your crummy life? Go to the bathroom already, geez!</p>
