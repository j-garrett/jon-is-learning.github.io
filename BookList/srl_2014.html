                            <h3>Speak Freely. Read Freely.</h3>
                            <p>We welcome you, the incoming freshman class, to the Cal campus on the 50th anniversary of an important period in our history, one that still defines a significant portion of the university’s public identity—the Free Speech Movement. As part of marking that anniversary, we’ve compiled a series of recommended readings on the subject of free speech for the 2014 edition of UC Berkeley’s Summer Reading List for Freshmen. We’re quite sure you’ll find something of interest to you on this list.</p>
                            <p>Every year, faculty, staff, and students offer their reading recommendations based on a particular theme, and then we share these books with the incoming class. There will be no exam; these are not required readings. Rather, these are works that these members of the campus community found compelling, and which they think you would too. The list is always eclectic, and always interesting. This year’s is no different.</p>
                            <p>You’ll find books here that treat the people and events of Berkeley in fall 1964 and soon after. You’ll also find books, both fiction and nonfiction (and some other media), that deal with other issues, places, and people that touch on the theme: freedom of the press, the women’s movement, Malala Yousafzai, Nelson Mandela, and so much more.</p>
                            <p>We encourage you to look up one, two, or all of them in one of UC Berkeley’s libraries, which hold one of the richest collections in the world. You can also find past years’ reading lists at the home page for <a href="http://reading.berkeley.edu/">reading.berkeley.edu</a>. Pick a book, then find a comfortable patch of grass on the Memorial Glade or a chair deep in the stacks of Doe Library, and take your place in the free thinking community of avid readers.</p>

Growing up in a working-class Catholic family, Savio struggled with a stammer, but he overcame his stammer to become a passionate and eloquent orator who led the Free Speech Movement in its struggle for political and academic freedom. Cohen tells the story of how Savio became a committed activist as the result of his experiences registering black voters in Mississippi during the Freedom Summer of 1964, and goes on to give a blow-by-blow account of the Free Speech Movement, its struggles and its final success. Here at Berkeley the Free Speech Movement Cafe stands as a memorial to the Movement and Savio’s role in it. Cohen’s book is both a biography of a remarkable individual and an account of a pivotal moment in Berkeley's history, and has been selected for this year’s “On the Same Page” program.">Summary</a>

Edgar Hoover. Obtaining this material was the result of numerous suits demanding access to documents under the Freedom of Information Act, and we readers have been given this compelling book as a result of Rosenfeld’s impressive persistence.">Summary</a>
