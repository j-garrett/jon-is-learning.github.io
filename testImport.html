<li><b>Me &amp; The Mosque</b></li>
<li>In North America, a large number of converts to Islam are
women. Many are drawn to the religion because of its emphasis on
social justice and spiritual equality between the sexes. Ironically
many mosques force women to pray behind barriers away from the men,
and some mosques do not even permit women to enter the building. In
this documentary journalist and filmmaker Zarqa Nawaz visits
mosques throughout Canada and talks to scholars, colleagues,
friends and neighbours about equal access for women. Written and
directed by Zarqa Nawaz. Dist.: <a href=

<li><b>The Purity Myth.</b></li>
<li>The United States is obsessed with virginity from the media to
schools to government agencies. The Purity Myth is an important and
timely critique of about why this is so, and why it's problematic
for girls and women. Analyzing cultural stereotypes and media
messages, Jessica Valenti reveals the overt and hidden ways our
society links a woman's worth to her sexuality rather than to
values like honesty, kindness, and altruism. With intelligence and
wit, this film exposes the legal and social punishments that women
who dare to have sex endure, while presenting a powerful argument
that evaluating girls and women on their sexuality needs to stop.
Directed by Jeremy Earp. Based on the book: The purity myth: how
America's obsession with virginity is hurting young women / Jessica

moments of life, baby girls and boys already behave differently.
Combining case histories and scientific analysis this program
argues that the mixture of hormones in the womb "hardwires" the

become distinctly female or male--or a mixture of both. <b>Video/C

Demonstrates how gender-based expectations are deeply intertwined

reveals groundbreaking studies, both practical and scientific, that
illustrate the variances between the learning patterns of boys and
girls from birth to adolescence. From a personal encounter with a
family trying to raise their sons and daughter with identical
influences to a series of observational experiments with a group of

equal opportunities has failed to iron out the great sex divide in
the workplace. This film examines primarily through research on the
brain, how biology plays a role in men's drive to succeed more than
it does for women, and why this may explain the lack of women in
the boardroom. Also looks at the contrasting behaviors of female
and male athletes and the difference of "risk taking" behavior
between the sexes. <b>Video/C 6372</b></li>

of equal opportunities raised expectations that men and women's
roles would become interchangeable. Yet, research reveals that most
men are neurologically primed to find household routine more
difficult, and that women are hormonally primed for maternal
behavior, finding such tasks less stressful than men do. This film
explores the neurological elements that help to perpetuate
persistent divisions of labor, and investigates the biological
basis of our seemingly unchangeable emotional systems. <b>Video/C

<li><b>I Lease Wombs, I Don't Sell Babies: An Inquiry Into
"Surrogate Motherhood"</b></li>
<li>Since it burst onto the public agenda in the 1980s, "surrogate"
motherhood has aroused controversy and confusion. This powerful
courtroom drama explores the ethical, emotional, and commercial
issues underlying the practice of surrogacy and depicts its effects
on three participants: the "biological" mother, who becomes
pregnant through artificial insemination, the father, and his wife.
In setting the issue of "surrogate" motherhood in the context of
individual lives, this well-acted video relates a story that is
seldom told and reveals the human side of this controversial
practice. The courtroom drama is based on actual testimony. Four
witnesses, each a party to a preconception agreement, are called to
testify: the husband and wife who are having trouble conceiving a
child, the broker who sets up the deal, and finally the "surrogate"
mother, who has relinquished her baby to the father and his wife
for $10,000, which translates to an hourly rate of less than the
minimum wage. This is a drama that should be seen by everyone
considering "surrogate" parenthood arrangements as well as by
professionals in the family planning and counseling fields. The
issues it raises force us to examine what it means to society when
motherhood is turned into a commercial activity and the values of
the marketplace take priority over the interests of women and their
children. 1992. 46 min. <b>Video/C MM540</b></li>

<li><b>Refrigerator Mothers</b></li>
<li>From the 1950s through the early 1970s, the American medical
establishment thought it had found the cause of autism: poor
mothering. Doctors presumed that the bizarre behaviors of autistic
children - rigid rituals, difficulty with speech, extreme
self-isolation - stemmed from their mothers' emotional frigidity.
We now know that autism is a brain disorder, not the result of poor
parenting. But for a whole generation of women branded as cold
"refrigerator mothers," the damage had already been done. 2002.. 54

<li><b>Codes of Gender</b></li>
<li>Communication scholar Sut Jhally applies the late sociologist
Erving Goffman's groundbreaking analysis of advertising to the
contemporary commercial landscape in this provocative new film
about gender as a ritualized commercial performance. Uncovering a
remarkable pattern of gender-specific poses, Jhally explores
Goffman's central claim that the way the body is displayed in
advertising communicates normative ideas about masculinity and
femininity. The film looks beyond advertising as a medium that
simply sells products, and beyond analyses of gender that focus on
biological difference or issues of surface objectification and
beauty, taking us into the two-tiered terrain of identity and power
relations. Contents: Sex &amp; gender -- The feminine touch -- The

<li><b>Generation M: Misogyny in Media &amp; Culture</b></li>
<li>Despite the achievements of the women's movement over the past
four decades, misogyny remains a presistent force in American
culture. This documentary examines the sexism that continues to
proliferate in media depictions, entertainment, and society.
Interviewees include Jean Kilbourne (Killing Us Softly), Jackson
Katz (Tough Guise), and many others. Looks at the selling of sex as
a form of female empowerment, idealized beauty, gender training,
misogyny in music and games, and the double standards that exist in
media and society when it comes to women and men, as well as
recommendations for change. Written, produced, and directed by
Thomas Keith. c2008. 60 min. <b>DVD X148</b></li>

<li><b>Hollywood Harems.</b></li>
<li>This documentary examines Hollywood stereotypes of the East,
with particular attention paid to the Middle East and the depiction
of women of the East. Juxtaposing film clips from the 20s through
the 80s, the filmmaker argues these fantasies have worked both to
shape and reinforce often derogative assumptions about the peoples
of the East while at the same time reinscribing the moral,
spiritual, and cultural supremacy of the Anglo-European West. 1999.

<li><b>Killing Us Softly 4</b></li>
<li>In this new, highly anticipated update of her pioneering
Killing us softly series, Jean Kilbourne takes a fresh look at how
advertising traffics in distorted and destructive ideals of
femininity. The film marshals a range of new print and television
advertisements to lay bare a stunning pattern of damaging gender
stereotypes--images and messages that too often reinforce
unrealistic, and unhealthy, perceptions of beauty, perfection, and
sexuality. By bringing Kilbourne's groundbreaking analysis up to
date, Killing us softly 4 stands to challenge a new generation to
take advertising seriously, and to think critically about popular
culture and its relationship to sexism, eating disorders, and
gender violence. Contents: Introduction -- Ads everywhere -- A
constructed beauty -- Objectification -- Judged by looks alone --
Thinness -- Dieting -- Eating &amp; morality -- Global impact --
Infantilization &amp; powerlessness -- Advertising &amp; sex --
Experienced virgins -- Consumerism &amp; sexualizing products --
Masculinity -- Violence -- What to do? Directed by Sut Jhally.

<li>Filmmaker Nicole Clark, a former Elite International fashion
model, calls for a necessary change: integrity and responsible
media for our youth. An examination of how advertising and the cult
of celebrity have deeply and negatively impacted teens and young
women, the film pairs ads and footage from the catwalks with
shocking interviews with editors from top fashion magazines. The

<li><b>The Cult of the Beautiful Body: Observations from the Plane
of Body Consciousnes</b></li>
<li>Extreme body consciousness has taken youthful narcissism to new
heights, making 'boy meets girl' a ruthless physical selection
process. This program examines the cult of the body in Western
society and how it has reduced today's courtship ritual to a
one-dimensional experience based primarily on physical attraction.
Beginning with the pressure that men currently feel to conform to
an abstract physical ideal, the role of the media is scrutinized,
along with the culture that from Munich to Los Angeles excludes all
who do not espouse the ideals of bodily perfection at the expense
of all else. 30 min. <b>Video/C 9679</b></li>

<li>As the daughters of the baby boom reached adolescence, the
American school system struggled to educate them on matters of

such topics were considered a godsend. They depicted the
reproductive system in anatomical detail or through puzzling
symbolism. Beyond sex education, classroom films addressed a wide

self-defense and how to appear more pleasing to others. You're

<li><b>Inside Out: Stories of Bulimia</b></li>
<li>Bulimia is on the rise, yet it is often portrayed in the media
as a kind of "extreme" dieting practiced by models, socialites and
others obsessed with their appearance. In reality, this eating
disorder can be as hard to overcome as any addiction and affects
both men and women from all walks of life. This documentary takes
the viewer into the lives of women and men who are struggling to
cope with bulimia and its consequences. It combines interviews and
observational footage of each of them and their family members
illuminating the feelings of compulsion, confusion and desperation
endemic to the disorder...but also the hope of recovery. 2002. 56

<li><b>The Vagina Monologues</b></li>
<li>"I was worried about vaginas. I was worried about what we think
about vaginas, and even more worried that we don?tthink about them.
So I decided to talk to women about their vaginas, to do vagina
interviews, which becamevagina monologues. I talkedwith hundreds of
women. I talked to old women, young women, married women, single
women, lesbians, college professors, actors, corporate
professionals, sex workers, African American women, Hispanic women,
Asian American Women, Native American women, Caucasian women,
Jewish women. At first, women were reluctant to talk. They were a
little shy. But once they got going, you couldn?t stop them." [Eve

<li><b>Perversion for Profit</b>(1965)</li>
<li>This propaganda film is a full-blown attack on the pornography
industry. Its main thesis is, pornography corrupts and perverts the
mind. The film makes outrageous and ridiculous claims (i.e. "75-90%
of all pornography bought ends up in the hands of children"). Using
fear tactics to make its case against pornography the investigation
varies from rape, to homosexuality, to sexual transmitted diseases,
to illegitimate births. As a secondary persuasion method the film
uses religion quoting the Bible several times. At the time the film
was made in the 1965, pornography was a 2 billion a year industry
and growing quite rapidly. Produced by Citizens for Decent

<li><b>Searching for Angela Shelton</b></li>
<li>Filmmaker Angela Shelton sets out on a journey to meet every
other Angela Shelton in America and through them survey the early
21st Century thoughts of American women. What she wasn't prepared
for was learning that, like herself, 24 out of 40 Angela Sheltons
she spoke to had been raped, beaten or molested. Then there was an
Angela Shelton who tracked sexual predators and just happened to
live in the same town as the filmmaker's father who molested her
and her step-siblings for years. The filmmaker's survey of women
becomes a journey of self discovery during which she decides to
confront her past and her father. The Angela Sheltons complete the
journey by teaching the filmmaker about forgiveness, faith and the
power of the human spirit in all of us, no matter what your name
is. 2004. 94 min. <b>DVD 6033</b></li>

<li>Takes the viewer on a journey with incarcerated battered women,

the abuse by their spouses, the murder, trial, parole process, and
finally, for one woman, freedom. It is thought in our society that
a woman can leave an abusive relationship at any time. However, the
women in this film prove the contrary. They were under the age of
24, isolated from their families and had virtuallly no money. They
all reached a point where there was a final beating in which the
survival instinct prevailed. In these final moments, they snapped
and killed. Produced and directed by Vita Lusty. Special features:

<li><b>War Zone</b></li>
<li>Filmmaker Maggie Hadleigh-West believes that for women, walking
the streets is like traversing a mine field. The anxiety that is
produced by gestures and verbal attacks (leers, taunts, catcalls,
and misguided "compliments") are perceived by women as a threat to
their safety and are a reminder of their powerlessness in society.
Armed with a movie camera, Hadleigh-West recorded men in the act of
harassing her on the city streets, filming 112 incidents of street
abuse in 7 1/2 hours. War zone documents one woman's experience
with this damaging behavior and attempts to define this phenomenon
as well as raise the awareness of both men and women to this
degrading and debilitating epidemic. c1993. 13 min. <b>DVD 9542

<li><b>In the Name of the Family</b></li>
<li>On December 10, 2007, a 16-year-old schoolgirl, Aqsa Parvez,
was strangled to death, and her father and brother are charged with
her murder. Three weeks later, teenage sisters, Amina and Sarah
Said, were shot to death in Dallas; their father fled the country
and is still wanted for murder. Six months later a 19-year-old
college student was stabbed by her brother; he was convicted and is
now in jail in New York. Friends and family of the murdered girls
paint a chilling portrait of the forces that led to their deaths,
and Toronto schoolgirls talk about their lives of constant fear.
While Muslim women organize to help girls at risk and the Imam at a
Toronto mosque teaches that violence has no basis in Islam, some
men continue to justify these crimes through patriarchal beliefs
about family honour. This documentary challenges the traditions
that lie behind the heartbreaking tragedies committed against young
girls caught between two cultures in North America. Directed,
written and produced by Shelley Saywell. 2010. 60 min. <b>DVD

nearly 100,000 domestic workers living in that city today. Judith
hasn't seen her four daughters for the two years since she left
Guatemala, but hopes to give them a better future by sending half
her income back home. Telma, from El Salvador, has cared for the
now six-year-old Mickey since he was a baby, essentially becoming
his 'mom' so his mother can keep her career on track. Eva, one of
the thousands of college-educated immigrants who have fled Mexico's
unstable economy, is attending night school to improve her skills,
and views housekeeping as a necessary transition.These women's
stories vividly reveal how immigrants are redefining their roles,
and underscores the vital role they play in many American
households. The issue of worker's rights is introduced in the film
through Dynamic Workers, a collective of women who have formed
their own business to provide job security and benefits, and
Domestic Workers Association, a support organization providing
information and advocacy. Produced &amp; directed by Anayansi

<li><b>Phantom of the Operator.</b></li>
<li>This delightful found-footage film reveals a little-known
chapter in labor history: the story of female telephone operators'
central place in the development of global communications. Presents
more than one hundred clips from rarely seen industrial,
advertising and scientific management films produced in North
America between 1903 and 1989 by Bell and Western Electric,
transformed into a dreamlike montage documentary. As the first
agents of globalization, this invisible army of women offered a way
for companies to feminize and glamorize what was a highly
stressful, underpaid and difficult job. Not merely 'Voices with a
Smile,' telephone operators were test pilots for new management
systems, and the face of shrewd public relations campaigns. As the
work of operators has been eclipsed by the advent of automated
systems, this artful piece of labor history also offers an
insightful comment on women's work, industrialization and
communications technology. A film by Caroline Martel. c2004. 66

<li><b>Type/caste: A Secretary with a Camera</b></li>
<li>Although the early 20th century "working girl" epitomized
independence and modernity, by the end of the century the
"secretary" had become the symbol of female subservience. This
innovative documentary was shot and edited over a period of several
years by a secretary working in downtown San Francisco. Loosely
structured as a "day in the life" of a secretary, the film is a
funny and compelling look inside the traditional female role in the
American workplace. The film effectively interweaves narration,
information on the history of clerical workers in the United
States, interviews, the voices of secretaries, and provocative
music, poetry, and performance to create a multilayered and highly
discussible filmic essay that will stimulate thought and debate in
a wide variety of courses in women's studies, labor studies,
sociology, psychology, and American studies. Produced by Eileen
