</li><li>  The article presents film criticism on the use of prison and prisoners as a metaphor in motion picture plays. Several definitions of what constitutes a metaphor in a motion picture are offered. Motion pictures which depict prison and prisoners are discussed including "Birdman of Alcatraz," and "The Shawshank Redemption." Motion pictures which use prison as a metaphor for other social experiences are examined including "The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner."

</li><li>"Generally, people have low levels of exposure to prisons through personal experience and therefore the media plays an important role in informing beliefs and actions. In particular prison films are an important and extensive form of media depiction. However, media depiction of crime and imprisonment has been criticised on ethical, political and social grounds. This article explores how prison films have depicted the relationship between the media, crime and punishment. It argues that this is a significant and integrated part of the prison film genre. It also argues that these representations are important both as a narrative device and in making the media a focus of pressure for reform." [Blackwell Synergy]

</li><li>"Female prisoners are an invisible correctional population; thus, media images are critical in shaping people's understanding of this social issue. Although research has examined how Hollywood depicts female prisoners, it has not delved into images found in reality-based programs. This study examined documentaries, televised news magazines, and talk shows to determine how these programs portray this incarcerated population and to identify how the issue is framed. Findings indicate that although some of the critical issues facing incarcerated women are presented, these programs still highlight factors that excite viewers, including violence and sex, thereby creating a sensationalized and damaging image of women behind bars."

</li><li>"Although the number of incarcerated females is rapidly increasing, few of us will have actual contact with women in a correctional setting. For the most part, our ideas about female inmates and the prisons they are housed in come from filmic images--images that, though highly accessible to the public, depict inaccurate accounts of prison life. From the use of unlikely characters and their corresponding improbable behavior to the maintenance of insecure facilities and impossible happenings, the four films reviewed for this article propagate common, negative stereotypes of inmates. After providing numerous filmic images of inaccurate depictions, the author provides counterexamples based on her own work in a maximum-security prison as an educator of female inmates. More than being wrong, celluloid portrayals of female prisoners inspire additional marginalization of a group who, though convicted of serious crimes, will eventually be released into society."

</li><li>"Analyzes 15 movies to explore whether films about prison life include male rape &amp; whether this is an accurate reflection of the existing literature. Each film is analyzed to determine if male rape is presented as a common occurrence, is an essential part of the plot of the movie, &amp; if the victims &amp; perpetrators fit the stereotypical profiles of those believed to be victims &amp; offenders in the prison culture. It was found that 50% of the films included an attempted or completed rape &amp; nearly 75% mentioned rape &amp; treated it as a common prison event. Consensual homosexual behavior &amp; prostitution were not represented. Physical force was usually involved, &amp; the victim displayed fear, but resisted physically. Prison officials were portrayed as passively accepting the practice of male rape. The results stand in contrast to studies that have found male rape in prison to be a relatively rare event. The sensationalization of male rape in prison may contribute to its acceptance as a deterrent of crime &amp; may discourage the moral outrage that such vulnerability should receive."

</li><li>"The increased populist and punitive turn in criminal justice policy in the United Kingdom over recent years has led to punishment becoming politicised, harsher and more ostentatious. The role of media and popular culture discourses of prison is rarely examined in this account. Adopting a Foucauldian discourse analysis of prison films released over the past 10 years, this article explores the prison film as one important element of the discursive regime. It seeks to investigate what representational practices are at work, how they limit the meaning of prison and prisoners, and how this may contribute to debates about the nature and aim of prison in contemporary society. It argues that several discursive practices exist in cinematic representations of the incarceration that strengthen support for the use of prison. The explicit and recurring depiction of violence in most prison films over the past 10 years, while appearing to offer evidence for prison reform, does the opposite. This paper suggests that discourses around the futility and inhumanity of incarceration are scant, replaced by scenes of prison violence; rape and death appear, which appear to exist purely for the pleasure of the spectator: a generic feature of the prison film. Secondly, prisoners are largely constructed as an inhuman other: a danger to society and deserving of harsh punishment. Consequently, the discursive regime of prison in cinema over the past decade constructs prison as not only necessary, but as the only process for crime control and reduction." [Taylor and Francis]

</li><li>"The 1990s saw a steady growth in the world prison population with the US contributing significantly to the upward trend. But, while it has been suggested that media-led panics &amp; the propagation of "prison myths" have legitimated prison growth, there has been little work done on the significance of representations of prison in popular cinema for social &amp; cultural understandings of imprisonment. The current article attempts to redress this neglect. After a brief review of some of the existing literature, an analysis of four significant "prison films" of the 1990s is presented. It is concluded that, with respect to film, the notion of challenging media misrepresentations of prisons &amp; prisoners is problematic. 24 References." [Sociological Abstracts]

</li><li>"Existing research on prison film--where it addresses gender--has largely focused
on the relationship between represented incarceration and hegemonic masculinities
(Jarvis, 2004; Mason, 2003; O'Sullivan, 2001). Although arguments are far more
complex, the general consensus appears to be that prison film as a whole
symbolically confirms, rather than challenges the existing hierarchical organization
of masculinities.
This article questions the preceding proposition. The debate begins at a theoretical
level, with a brief overview of some elements of masculinity studies theory that are
relevant to analysis of prison film. Next, I introduce Butler's concept of
'insurrectionary speech'. Through textual analysis, 'insurrectionary speech'
(Butler, 1997) becomes a vehicle for reading certain fictional representations of
prison as renegotiations of conventional hegemonic masculinity is present-day
North America. In light of a number of recent productions, the article considers
the insurrectionary potential of prison film as a genre."

</li><li>"Most contemporary American prison films represent the relationship between the inside &amp; the outside of the prison through the prison escape. Paradoxically, the prison break both produces &amp; undermines the distinction between inside &amp; outside, which doesn't allow us to know very much about the prison itself. The audience is able to walk out of the theater without much thought regarding how prison structures our everyday lives. But the prison montage that opens Sam Peckinpah's 1972 film The Getaway expresses how the prison functions as a microcosm of social totality at the same time it is the locus of the most radical exclusion from the social. In this way, prison actually fragments or destroys the fascistic fantasy of tantalization, which is based on an omnipotent vision of the whole. And cinematic montage becomes a mighty means through which to express this new understanding of totality." [Sociological Abstracts]

</li><li>"British cinema of the 1950s has recently been the subject of substantial reappraisal which has sought to rescue it from its former image as dull and reactionary. However, one thing that has stayed the same is the notion of this period of British cinema as male-dominated, particularly through the critical focus on the war film genre. An analysis of director J. Lee Thompson's career in the 1950s provides an interesting corrective to this. Thompson's films focus predominantly on women, particularly those who do not or cannot fit in with accepted modes of female behaviour. These include two films about women in prison, The Weak and The Wicked (1953) and Yield To The Night (1956), and one about an unhappy housewife, Woman in a Dressing Gown (1957). This article also discusses Thompson's contribution to the war film, Ice Cold In Alex (1958), which interestingly, is one of the few examples of the genre to give a central role to a female character. Although the personnel behind these films are mainly men, including Thompson himself, these films powerfully expose the contradictions and problems in constructions of femininity at the time, and merit more critical attention than they have previously received."

However, one thing that has stayed the same is the notion of this period of British cinema as male-dominated, particularly through the critical focus on the war film genre. An analysis of director J. L. Thompson's career in the 1950s provides an interesting corrective to this. Thompson's films focus predominantly on women, particularly those who do not or cannot fit in with accepted modes of female behavior. These include 2 films about women in prison, The Weak and The Wicked (1953) and Yield To The Night (1956), and 1 about an unhappy housewife, Woman in a Dressing Gown (1957). This article also discusses Thompson's contribution to the war film, Ice Cold In Alex (1958), which is 1 of the few examples of the genre to give a central role to a female character. Although the personnel behind these films are mainly men, including Thompson himself, these films expose the contradictions and problems in constructions of femininity at the time, and merit more critical attention than they have previously received."
