<li>"Examines the role of war correspondents in Hollywood films made from the Vietnam War era to 2002. Such films as The Green Berets (1968), Salvador (1986), and We Were Soldiers (2002) portray war reporting as an ambivalent occupation in which noncombatant correspondents are often called on to make a commitment and even take up arms. Correspondents obsessed with "getting the story" are often ridiculed or played as buffoons." [America: History and Life]

<li>"The article focuses on the depiction of journalists in motion pictures. The author provides a brief overview of films with journalist protagonists and films which are about journalism. The author discusses journalists who appear to craft factual literary pieces rather than report the news. Particular attention is given to the depiction of journalism in the film "Shattered Glass." Advocacy journalism is defined and discussed." [Ebsco]

The article discusses the portrayal of journalists in Hollywood movies. Reporters and other newsmen are seen as having gone through a period of negative portrayals in the 1980s and 1990s in such films as "Absence of Malice" and "Wag the Dog." However, the individual journalist has been rehabilitated in the 2000s with films such as "Capote" and "The Hunting Party."

<li>"Hollywood is no longer depicting reporters as heroes, which is a reflection of the current mood toward journalists. In 1976, All the President's Men glamorized the press, but Oliver Stone's 1996 Nixon hardly mentions Woodward and Bernstein. In 1994, the movie Quiz Show did not mention the key role newspaper reporters played in uncovering the game show scandals of 1958. The journalist as a rogue is much more popular in the movies of the '90s." [Expanded Academic Index]

<li> "Television and film usually portrays journalists as one of four stock characters, the newsroom monster, the cardboard cutout, the saint with a crooked halo or the newsroom saint. The journalist has most often been seen in the role of the heartless hack who will do anything for a story, which was typified in the 1931 classic 'The Front Page.' The saintly crusader made a brief appearance in the 1970s starting with 'All the President's Men', but has disappeared as other villains have been scripted." [Expanded Academic Index]

<li>"Sympathetic portrayals of journalists in motion pictures, such as "All the President's Men," and on television series, such as "Lou Grant," often inspire budding reporters to seek careers in journalism. Although Hollywood's depictions of the profession may not be realistic, they do not necessarily lead to disillusionment later on. Three journalists describe the way such portrayals influenced their career choices and how they have successfully adapted their glamorous expectations to the real world of journalism."

Gledhill's (1989) concept of negotiation, which analyzes the struggle between competing frames of reference (text vs consumer) to derive meaning from cultural commodities, is employed to study the film's ideological message that white professional women must make a choice between a career or a personal life, & choosing a career makes them less a woman in the traditional sense. However, the film also offers moments that contradict this dominant ideology." [Sociological Abstracts]
