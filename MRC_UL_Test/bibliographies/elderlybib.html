</li><li>"Have changing demographics, increased life expectancy and findings about gender similarities and differences, altered portrayals of older people in American feature films during the past 65 years? We identified 3,038 films made between 1929 and 1995 in which actors and actresses, nominated at least once during their lifetimes for an Oscar award, appeared when aged 60 years or older. Academy Award nominees were selected because they offered a sample of 'notable' performers and an accessible database. We selected an eight per cent random sample for a content analysis of their roles. Throughout this period, men were more likely to be depicted as vigorous, employed and involved in same-gender friendships and adventure (whether as hero or villain). Women remained either peripheral to the action or were portrayed as rich dowagers, wives/mothers, or lonely spinsters. Despite changing gender roles in later life since the 1930s and despite social and economic changes for older Americans (earlier retirement age and better health are but two examples), their film roles have remained remarkably static in age and gender stereotyping. In feature films, the mask of ageing differs by gender. Male masks veil inactivity and physical changes, while female masks reveal ageist and sexist stereotypes."

</li><li> The article examines the difficulties facing older motion picture actors and actresses in finding lead roles in films. The dominant role of young adults in motion picture audiences has led producers to avoid scripts focusing on older or middle-aged persons. Veteran actor Jeff Bridges, whose role in the motion picture "Crazy Heart" is an exception to this trend, notes that the recession means that fewer motion pictures of any kind are being produced.

</li><li>The article focuses on the fear of aging among women and the dominance of older women characters in Western horror films. It points out that the fear of aging is not gender-neutral. The fear of aging is attributed to the fact that it is unavoidable. Also noted is the tendency of women to hate the characters instead of acknowledging the fact that aging is the real culprit behind such emotion.

The author also looks at her own "youthful ideas about aging" that reflect a sentimentalized view, and she points to ways ageism is a feminist issue.
