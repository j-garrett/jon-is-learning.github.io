</li><li>"The writer investigates the drama of geopolitical and maternal separation at the heart of The Piano, a film directed by Jane Campion. In its dramatization of a melancholic daughter's dilemma, The Piano demonstrates that clinging to the body of the mother might be a kind of suicide, as the subject is incapable of constructing itself as a "living system" that is "open to the other, capable of adaptation and change." The film envisions a postcolonial, postpatriarchal contract that is not predicated on a loss that is nostalgically mourned in the new order established, but precisely on an excess (concerning the mother) that opens up the very potential of the new. It is easy to dismiss Campion's (re)turn to the ancestral motherlands of the Victorian female body and the New Zealand landscape as a collapse into essentialism, but her treatment of these maternal bodies is sensitive to the ambiguity of their role within a colonial, phallogocentric economy."

</li><li>Author's Abstract: COPYRIGHT 2001 Northern Illinois University
"All of Jane Campion's feature films, if most notably The Piano, have generated intense and dramatically polarized debate, especially among female spectators and critics. All make use of female voiceover narration and all share a focus on women together with complex structures of narration, characterization, and plot development that thwart any easy or unambiguous interpretation. In addition, Campion revisits genres and storytelling modes of interest to women--abuse narratives, melodrama, battle of the sexes--and re-tells their stories, significantly refusing to invoke their conventional frameworks of truth and morality. Though Campion consistently deals with abuse, oppression, and mistreatment of women in all of her feature films, she resolutely forgoes the moral judgments of melodrama and refuses to portray her protagonists as victims. In this, she proffers an aesthetic challenge to the ressentiment that Wendy Brown argues has shaped the epistemology and politics of much feminist discourse." [Expanded Academic Index]

</li><li>Campion's adaptation of Henry James's novel 'The Portrait of a Lady' is superb rendering of the nuances of a woman's life. The film stars Nicole Kidman and John Malkovich, and has beautiful cinematography. Some of Campion's other films are also discussed.

While it is ostensibly about cults and cultism, the film is ultimately about reconciling imagination with reality. It links fantasy and realism so that the characters, having undergone their own tortured and radical awakenings, become reconciled to compromise. This is an immense, emotional, enthralling movie that wears its brilliance casually.” [Art Index]

</li><li>”Jane Campion's Holy Smoke! is a fearless, flawed, and profound movie. Kate Winslett plays Ruth Baron, an open-souled Australian who falls hard for an Indian guru. Her eccentric family hire cult expert P. J. Waters (Harvey Keitel) to deprogram their prodigal daughter. Set against a backdrop of the awesome vastness of the Australian outback, the two engage in spiritual and gender combat in a claustrophobic cabin. Winslett's exposed performance is matched by some raw and brave acting by Keitel. In conversation, Campion discusses, among other subjects, the making of Holy Smoke! and her next project.” [Art Index]

</li><li>"The cinematography in Jane Campion's new film, In the Cut, is discussed. This urban thriller, which focuses on a sensitive woman who becomes embroiled in a murder investigation, functions as a detective story as well as a character dissection, its terrain being New York's literal and metaphorical dark side. Its mood was approached by director of photography Dion Beebe with handheld work, using Arricam and Moviecam lightweight camera systems fitted with Zeiss Ultra Primes or with Century Optics' bellow-mounted Clairmont Swing &amp; Shift system. Beebe's equipment and lighting are discussed.” [Art Index]

</li><li>"A sensuous study of desire and masochism wrapped around a straight-up thriller, this film gives audiences three murdered women to keep them interested while director Jane Campion deals with more troubling preoccupations. However, as finely crafted as this provocative and complex film is, one could argue that it fails as a genre exercise, since experienced thriller fans will guess the killer faster than it takes to recite an Emily Dickinson poem. But once the mystery's been solved, what is left is a minutely etched study in mood and female psychology." [Art Index]

</li><li>"Jane Campion's most recent movie, In the Cut, has surprised critics because it forsakes her usual territory of Anglo Australia and a high literary mode for New York City and the pop culture ramifications of a slasher/thriller. Nonetheless, the film does continue and amplify themes and plot patterns that are recognizable from the director's earlier major works, such as white middle-class women being forcibly held and at risk from male violence and socially sanctioned power. With regard to style, In the Cut's forceful and vivid cinematography splinters the harsh urban setting, moving the narrative further into dreamscape, into the interiority of female experience. Shifting both toward and away from mainstream cinema was a courageous step, but it overtaxed an often insubstantial public appreciation for Campion's work." [Art Index]

</li><li>”With In the Cut, Jane Campion has dived into the psychosexual abyss and created a broken fairy tale. The film is adapted from the best-selling first-person novel by Susanna Moore, the lurid conclusion of which sparked a flurry of controversy in feminist academic circles. In the Cut has a vague resemblance to the liberated-woman-in-jeopardy thrillers that were the response of 1970s Hollywood to incipient feminist consciousness, but Campion's suspicion of the existing order and her emphasis on the irrational element of female desire do not fit into narrative formulas, as those movies do.”

The film depicts women as mere symbols of sex and death, emphasizing women's lack of capacity to speak in public. However, the voice of Ada, the film's heroine, does not entirely fade into nothingness. Instead, it finds its place in the mouth of other silent heroines such as Flora, Ada's daughter, who translates Ada's voice through sign language and balletic expressions." [Expanded Academic Index]

</li><li>Author's Abstract:
"This article examines two films, Daughters of the Dust, by Julie Dash, and The Piano, by Jane Campion. While both are subversive tales that rely on unconventional narrative techniques to examine and challenge female subordination and ethnocentric ideological systems, they are simultaneously "foundational" epics that mythologize this subordination even as they attempt to resist it. Key to this process is each film's reliance on native Others to both create and sustain a space of individuality and revolt for the female protagonist. Despite significant differences in the structure and perspective of each production, in both, the indigenous characters are silenced in order to permit non-native women the right to speak and affirm themselves and their embattled identities. This article analyzes both the tensions and forms of novel representation arising from this process." [Expanded Academic Index]

</li><li>"Artistry frees the human spirit from social constraints in Jane Campion's 'The Piano.' Ada, the film's main character, has chosen to stop speaking and communicates either through a private set of gestures shared with her daughter or by playing a piano. When art supports nature in the film, both grow stronger, while separating art and nature leads to failure. Ada abandons her piano rather than let it carry her into the ocean, but retains its mental image as she enters her new life." [Expanded Academic Index]

</li><li>Shows how post-Jungian animus theory illuminates the mysterious personality of Ada, the mute heroine of Jane Campion's The Piano (1993). In particular, Ann Ulanov's (1971) thoughts about animus development are connected with Demaris Wehr's (1987) observations concerning the internalization of social oppression in an argument that shows how, notwithstanding she is a woman, Ada is a product of colonial oppression. Her mythological antecedents are also considered and are particularly marked in that she resembles the handless maiden in Marie-Louise von Franz's (1993) analysis of that fairy tale. In this context Ada's ultimate renunciation of her husband is symbolically reinforced by the developing personality of her daughter Flora. The changes in both characters can be seen as implying not only the rebirth of Ada's psyche but also the emergence of a new psychological readiness to throw off the colonial mantle.

</li><li>"The art film's evocative image as a site of lingering affective power and uncertain meaning explains the enduring fascination of Jane Campion's 1993 film The Piano with female viewers. The film's closing scene, where the protagonist imagines herself anchored to her piano at the bottom of the sea, illustrates the relationship between cinematic visuals and affective responses negotiated through the viewer's past experiences. The associations that occur between this arresting image and those of other texts are created by means of a series of parallelisms that cover a wide territory, from the visual to the cultural; far from being unbounded, they find their roots in the viewer's cultural experience. Particulars between viewers vary, but through its graphic reenactment of a drama of a female identity that can potentially intersect in heterogeneous ways with the experiences of viewers, Campion's film invites personalization, which is a prime feature of cult relationships to film."

</li><li>"The writer investigates the drama of geopolitical and maternal separation at the heart of The Piano, a film directed by Jane Campion. In its dramatization of a melancholic daughter's dilemma, The Piano demonstrates that clinging to the body of the mother might be a kind of suicide, as the subject is incapable of constructing itself as a "living system" that is "open to the other, capable of adaptation and change." The film envisions a postcolonial, postpatriarchal contract that is not predicated on a loss that is nostalgically mourned in the new order established, but precisely on an excess (concerning the mother) that opens up the very potential of the new. It is easy to dismiss Campion's (re)turn to the ancestral motherlands of the Victorian female body and the New Zealand landscape as a collapse into essentialism, but her treatment of these maternal bodies is sensitive to the ambiguity of their role within a colonial, phallogocentric economy."

</li><li>"Critical acclaim for the motion picture 'The Piano' has focussed on the its portrayal of gender issues. However, another aspect of the film is its setting in the colonial structures of New Zealand, probably in the early 19th century. Director Jane Campion uses imagery to portray aspects of relations between the white settlers and the indigenous Maoris. These aspects include the portrayal of the Maoris as a group rather as individual characters, and the portrayal of the Maoris as part of nature." [Expanded Academic Index]

</li><li>Presents a brief psychoanalytic interpretation and review of the film The Piano (1993), directed by Jane Campion. The author notes that an interesting quality of The Piano is the dearth of information about Ada's childhood other than the sudden onset of her muteness at the age of 6 yrs; there is no mention of her mother. It is also noted that throughout the film we see multiple representations of the merged and the interchangeable identities of Ada and Flora (Flora speaks for Ada), the mother-daughter dyad. The significance of the piano as a poignant transitional object linked to the absence of Ada's mother is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2004 APA, all rights reserved)

</li><li>”The touted feminist text of Jane Campion's film The Piano is undermined by a lack of inter-racial understanding or even interaction on the part of Ada, its main protagonist. It has been argued that the developing sexual relationship between Ada and Baines, her lover and a fellow Scotsman "gone native," enacts a fantasy of reconciliation that permits them to become "real" New Zealanders. However, Ada's femininism not only suppresses the heterogeneity of the native Maori, but also negates the race completely, and as such must be seen as a form of imperialism. Moreover, Baines's "understanding" of the Maori appears one-way, with the Maori characters constantly giving and Baines simply receiving--an analogy that could apply to colonialism itself.” [Art Index]

</li><li>  Reflects on the ways in which the complex iconography of The Piano provides access to early hungers, fears, and longings oriented toward the mother's sensual and voluptuous body--the journey into the primal swampy "dark continent." The birth of desire and emergent capacity to speak and be heard, and the genuine capacity for mutuality in love that emerges slowly in both George Baines and Ada McGrath, has its roots in the discovery and acceptance of the "dark continent" of the feminine body. It's suggested that such creative discovery and acceptance lead from repressive sensory isolation to erotic vitality. Adult heterosexual erotic excitement, evidenced in Ada and Baines's love affair, reveals the rich reparative possibilities of adult relationships to heal early deprivation and provide the path to oedipal resolution. The author concludes that the imagery of the film furnishes an associative vehicle for patients to explore their internal unconscious relations to the internal mother and father, which form or deform their intersubjective adult relations. The clinical case of a female analysand is also presented in this article, for whom the iconography of The Piano became a central organizing metaphor.

</li><li>"The theme of women discovering freedom links Jane Campion's motion picture 'The Piano' and Henry James's novel, 'The Portrait of a Lady.' The protagonist of each work searches for self-actualization, discovering it when she abandons the male-imposed burdens that had controlled her life. Ada in 'The Piano' must abandon the instrument that symbolizes her civilized identity, while Isabel in 'Portrait' needs to give up her passionate, sexual self, and this is how each woman liberates herself.

</li><li>”A discussion of Jane Campion's adaptation of Henry James's Portrait of a Lady. Campion and screenwriter Laura Jones offer a reading of James's work that harks back to Campion's first youthful exploration of the novel and elaborates on it. Campion's work to date has been so deliriously uncensored that it taps into the most perverse parts of the female psyche, unafraid to deal with women who are the undoing of themselves. At the troubled, and therefore fascinating, core of her work is the exploration of female masochism. This is no less predominant in Portrait, where Isabel allows herself to be ensnared by Osmond into the most sadomasochistic of relationships. Campion traces Isabel's journey, from ingenue to a woman caught up in an elaborate style. In this film haunted by Eros and Thanatos, the path to love seems one of psychotic self-destruction.” [Art Index]

</li><li>"The writer discusses Jane Campion's film version of Henry James's Portrait of a Lady. Generally, critics who became enamored with Campion for her earlier films, such as The Piano, responded ambivalently to Portrait of a Lady. Some regarded the dubious decision to make a Hollywood-style movie, worse still an adaptation, as Campion dabbling in the waters of "literary" cinema, "coarsening" her vision as a consequence. Undoubtedly, Campion was making a bid for the mainstream with the film, because it oozes money and high production values. Appearing in 1996 after a spate of Jane Austen movie adaptations and during a surge of American and British "literary" films, Campion's contribution seems suspiciously like an opportunity to exploit the trend for films based on the classics."

</li><li>”Only a filmmaker with the hubris to think that art and moral adventure matter could have made The Portrait of a Lady in the densely telling hues and uncompromising forms Jane Campion has achieved. Campion's film largely succeeds in recasting Henry James's exquisitely wrought prose, his interior epiphanies and apocalypses, into dialogue, images, and performances that explode in slowest, completely devastating motion. The novel's central metaphors, resonating dialogue, and actors are authentically brought to life, without cinematic disguise or distortion, with Campion recording the journeys of women into unknown territory with passionate conviction, making their quests as emblematic of the human condition as any Adam's.” [Art Index]

We see freedom as the impermanence of choice, while Isabel asserts her self-worth by entering a bad marriage without being forced. The debate should not center on whether the film or the novel is preferable, but on what adaptations should try to accomplish." [Expanded Academic Index]
