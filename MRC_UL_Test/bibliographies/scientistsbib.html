</li><li>"Discusses the changing images that television and films present of women as scientists. Television has given more space to women, particularly in the higher levels of medicine, in the vast array of medical dramas, and films have presented more women in scientific roles, but often marginal ones. Fictionalized presentations tend to ignore the overt and covert inhospitability to women present in many scientific workplaces. The author illustrates her points with examples from the films Desk Set (1957), a romantic comedy that presents women's work as secondary to men's and offers the possibility that computers will displace female reference librarians; Disclosure (1995), featuring a man with a beautiful boss who attempts to use him as a corporate pawn and relies on exploiting men to promote her own career; and The Net (1995), depicting a somewhat ordinary woman who uses her Internet skills in a battle against an international conspiracy related to a lethal computer virus. The films show different perspectives on as-yet-unrealized ideals of how computing technology might be employed to best serve, rather than dehumanize, humanity." [America:  History and Life]

This article focuses on the portrayal of female scientists and the reception of such depictions within the general understanding. The article questions: the images depicted; their relation to scientific reality; how such depictions have changed over time (1929-1997); and their significance within the broader social context.

</li><li>"Cinematic depictions of physicians potentially can affect public expectations and the patient-physician relationship, but little attention has been devoted to portrayals of physicians in movies. The objective of the study was the analysis of cinematic depictions of physicians to determine common demographic attributes of movie physicians, major themes, and whether portrayals have changed over time. All movies released on videotape with physicians as main characters and readily available to the public were viewed in their entirety. Data were collected on physician characteristics, diagnoses, and medical accuracy, and dialogue concerning physicians was transcribed. The results showed that in the 131 films, movie physicians were significantly more likely to be male (p &lt; 0.00001), White (p &lt; 0.00001), and &lt; 40 years of age (p &lt; 0.009). The proportion of women and minority film physicians has declined steadily in recent decades. Movie physicians are most commonly surgeons (33%), psychiatrists (26%), and family practitioners (18%). Physicians were portrayed negatively in 44% of movies, and since the 1960s positive portrayals declined while negative portrayals increased. Physicians frequently are depicted as greedy, egotistical, uncaring, and unethical, especially in recent films. Medical inaccuracies occurred in 27% of films. Compassion and idealism were common in early physician movies but are increasingly scarce in recent decades. A recurrent theme is the "mad scientist," the physician-researcher that values research more than patients' welfare. Portrayals of physicians as egotistical and materialistic have increased, whereas sexism and racism have waned. Movies from the past two decades have explored critical issues surrounding medical ethics and managed care. We conclude that negative cinematic portrayals of physicians are on the rise, which may adversely affect patient expectations and the patient-physician relationship. Nevertheless, films about physicians can serve as useful gauges of public opinion about the medical profession, as tools for medical education, and as instruments of positive social change in efforts to reform managed care."

</li><li>"Science fiction films of the 1930s and 1940s were often set in dark laboratories that had strange looking glass containers with bubbling fluids and mad scientists conducting glandular and hormonal experiments. In the 1950s, films were more focused on radiation induced mutations. The 1960s and 1970s brought more sophisticated biological sciences to the movies and focused on such relatively new concepts as immunology, cyrobiology, and biochemistry. In the 1980s and 1990s, the focus of science fiction films has been DNA. This work of film criticism relates 71 science fiction films to the biological sciences. The author covers cell biology, pharmacology, endocrinology, hematology, and entomology, to name just a few topics. An analysis of each film includes a brief plot synopsis, the author's favorite quotations, the biological principles involved, the accuracy of the laboratory, and correct and incorrect biological information. In his analyses, the author sets out what would be required to achieve in real life the results seen in the movies and whether these experiments or events could actually happen."

</li><li>"Considerable attention has been paid to the representation of scientists as villains in horror and science fiction films, and to the part this has played in creating the public perception of scientists. But science and scientists have also been represented in films which do not fit readily with the conventions of these genres, and these "mainstream" films allow a more detailed investigation of the public perception of science at the time they were made. This paper examines a number of British mainstream films portraying scientists and science from the period 1945-1970 to see in what ways the conduct of science was being questioned. A concern with the political control of science and the resulting secrecy is evident in a number of the films. The criticism of scientists seems to come from two contradictory directions. Scientists were either seen as too detached and unconcerned about the consequences of their work, or they were too emotional and insufficiently objective. This is in part explained by newer, less deferential attitudes to science co-existing with the older, heroic view during the period under study." [SageLink]

</li><li>By exploring the relationship between the scientific community and the entertainment industry in the construction of fictional films, this paper investigates the impact   that fictional representations, created with the assistance of scientists, have on the construction of scientific knowledge and the public understanding of science. I   discuss the nature of science consulting on fictional films, including compensation, consultants' role in the filmmaking process, and the scientific elements  consultants can impact in the films. By questioning the nature of fictional "accuracy, " I demonstrate that the scientific community's focus on "scientific accuracy" in fiction is flawed. Fictional film naturalizes both "accurate" and "inaccurate" science by presenting both as "natural" via a perceptually realistic framework.

</li><li>American motion pictures present conflicting views of scientists. Movies such as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Dr. Strangelove, and The Island of Dr. Moreau reveal scientists that are extremely knowledgable but do not know the full implications of their knowledge. Some of these scientists are madmen who would perform any experiment on themselves or their subjects to achieve desired goals." [Expanded Academic Index]

</li><li>"The Gothic-inspired stories of mad scientists in the 19th century as adapted onto drama and film have renderd the mad scientist character more depreaved and evil. This has contributed to the overall public fear and distrust of science and scientists and does not develop a healthy interest in the scientific field. However, changes in the mad scientist's character can effect changes in the public's attitude towards science." [Expanded Academic Index]

</li><li>"New knowledge has met with ambivalence, as is documented in myths ever since that of Prometheus. This ambivalence is also apparent in the representations of science in   literature and the popular media, most prominent among them movies. Shelley's Frankenstein has become the icon of the "mad scientist" as depicted by filmmakers ever since the 1930s. To trace such   patterns of ambivalence and stereotypes of scientists and science in fiction film, 222 movies were analyzed. It is apparent that modification of, and intervention   into, the human body, the violation of human nature, and threats to human health by means of science are depicted as the most alarming aspects of scientific inquiry.  The threat is dramatized by being associated with the image of the scientist as pursuing the quest for new knowledge in secrecy, outside the controls of academic institutions and peers. Scientific research as perceived by fiction film is seldom a venture across the boundaries of the permissible." [Sage Publications]
