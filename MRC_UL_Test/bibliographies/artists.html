A dark satire, Cachimba recounts the most memorable moment in the life of a hapless accountaint, Marcos, who comes upon an antiquated townhouse carrying quite possibly the most masterful undiscovered painter his county ever produced. Such serendipity fuels Marcos on a war against corruption and bureaucracy to uphold the standing of this nearly forgotten master. Although our quixotic hero is against powerful odds, the battle imbues him with a purpose never before felt, and it shows -- with his work, with his relations, and most importantly with the love of his life, the hefty yet naive Hildad. Co-workers, bosses, etc., all may turn against Marcos, but through his passion a national museum and lifelong love shall endure.

This relentless, nervy film noir explores the sinister world of violence and the monied world of aesthetics as Steele's attempt to reconstruct what really happened leads him to murder, mania and an international conspiracy that threatens the museum's masterpieces.
