<li>"Excerpts from newsreels released in France during the Second World War are generally familiar to scholars, thanks to their widespread use in retrospective documentaries such as Marcel Ophuls's The Sorrow and the Pity (1969) and Claude Chabrol's The Eye of Vichy (1993). Although historians have often used newsreels to illustrate key aspects of German policy and French collaboration, until recently these films have not received widespread attention as an object of study in their own right. Following the trail blazed by Marc Ferro and Jean-Pierre Bertin-Maghit, a new generation of scholars is now rediscovering newsreels and documentaries as long-standing archival restrictions are lifted and fragile nitrate films are catalogued and preserved. Wartime newsreels are complex cultural products encompassing political, social, and economic dimensions. As such, they provide a unique perspective on these branches of history and constitute a valuable source for reassessing and refining existing scholarship. In the case of France, newsreels are particularly relevant for understanding the link between propaganda and public opinion since relatively few of the fiction films distributed there during the war served as vehicles of German or Vichy French ideology. Unlike feature films, which typically played for only four weeks or less in any given location, newsreels were a mandatory part of all cinema programs throughout the war. As for the handful of ideologically loaded fiction films designed specifically to influence spectators, newsreels offer a useful basis for evaluating comparatively the impact of film propaganda on collective mentalities."

<li>"Cinema has been one of the fields examined through the cultural lens. The moving image and its associated discourses have been fragmented and subject to analysis of view of their historical, political, and cultural contexts. Within studies of fascism there exists a broad field of cultural-political research on the propagandistic aspects of the fascist regime. There has been constant interest in film propaganda with a focus on Italy and on newsreels. Propaganda newsreels, produced under fascism by the LUCE institute, have also aroused recent scholarly interest. This paper's analysis of the distribution and propagation side of the newsreels, defined as a weekly series of edited and collated news items, were propagated to project an image of fascism. Archival material from the Central State Archive in Rome is used to support the arguments presented in this paper. The documents come from the public collection, or Carteggio Ordinario, of documents from Mussolini's government office, the Segreteria Particolare del Duce." [Communication Abstracts]

<li>"Propaganda is a central issue for non-fiction film in the Third Reich. Along with a few well-known and often discussed propaganda films, the newsreels have generally been viewed as the perfect propaganda instrument for the National Socialists. They have to be discussed as a part of the Nazi media system, which includes newspapers, magazines, radio, and the beginnings of television as well as photography or paintings and which developed a special aesthetics and Nazi symbolism. The newsreels determine the image of the Third Reich that we have in our minds today, since they form the basis for nearly all the popular historical programs on television. Surprisingly, however, there is not much research in Germany about this area of film production. Some highly detailed analyses were down at the IWF in Göttingen, the German center for scientific film. From the 1970s on, there have been some books published by former cameramen and a few books on newsreels, but a detailed overview is lacking. Just recently, in June 2003, the first 100 hours of German newsreels were put on the Internet for research purposes, which was made possible through the cooperation of selected archives, copyright owners, and the DEFA foundation; a fourth of these newsreels are before 1945. In recent years, in various countries like Belgium, Norway, France, and Luxembourg, an intense study of the German newsreels for the occupied countries has been done. In this article, the author gives a short overview of the German newsreel production in World War II, noting some aspects of the newsreels that tend to put the idea of them as perfect propaganda into question."

<li>Film propaganda in World War I was effective as long as public opinion was behind the war effort. In 1916 and early-1917, such films had a favourable audience, and helped to link those who had been to the war with those at home. Such films as 'The Battle of the Ancre' and 'The Battle of the Somme' helped to support the moral behind Britain's cause. Later, by early-summer in 1917, public mood had swung away from the war effort, and film propaganda had lost its audience for good.

The Nazis used the Spanish war to test military innovations for World War II, but they did not really experiment with propaganda techniques, given their unofficial participation. They offered their propaganda machinery to the insurgents in Spain, offering documents they got indirectly more than they did those visual ones from the field. Nazi film makes the medium a weapon and conceives of form itself as an event. Documentaries on Spain tried to stir up anxiety and to insinuate, dealing with stereotypical emotional responses."

I concentrates on the role that religion played as a theme of propaganda primarily in British and American movies, as well as some of the Soviet films released during the decade. The article ex-plores the relationship between film output and state propagandists to show how religious themes were incorporated into films dealing with Cold War is-sues, and considers how audiences received the messages contained within these films. The article therefore builds on recent scholarship that highlights the importance of ideas and culture during the Cold War by looking at the adoption and adaptation of religion as a tool of propaganda."

<li>"With a few important exceptions, Third Reich newsreels have attracted little scholarly attention. That feature film and documentary have attracted more is understandable, especially as many non-historians have been drawn to the subject. Most historians involved with Third Reich film have concerned themselves with propaganda, which is not unexpected, in view of their interest in the state and the fact that Third Reich film (of all varieties)-either overtly or covertly in numerous ways-promoted the interests of the state. But given this interest in propaganda, the neglect of newsreels, which formed part of the Third Reich cinema program, is all the more surprising. If the message was not overt in feature film, it was in newsreels, which from late 1938 formed a compulsory part of the cinema program, as was also later the case in occupied Europe. During the war, it reached large numbers as cinema attendance was very high. These contributors add considerably to the knowledge about the structure and organizations of the Third Reich newsreel empire, newsreel production history, and, most important, a consideration of newsreel reception. Newsreels also of themselves provide a valuable historical source for understanding the period in which they were produced and shown, in this case the war, and in particular the relationship between propaganda and public opinion. The picture that emerges is a complex one, and the variations from context to context are significant." [Communication Abstracts]
