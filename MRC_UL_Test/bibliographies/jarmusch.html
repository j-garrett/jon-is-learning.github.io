<li>"The cinema of the great Japanese director Yasujiro Ozu still embodies, in the West, a vision of "transcendental" purity. So precise in their registration of time passing, so moving in their portrayal of ordinary people and events, Ozu's movies, through their harmonious compositions and their infinite wealth of detail, also create a sense of timelessness. No Ozu tradition exists in Western cinema, although occasionally a film reflects something of his rigor, generosity, and implacable realism. In the East, Ozu has become a symbol of a purely Asian cinema, free of Hollywood hegemony. It is by his example of a cinema of time, rather than any particular stylistic procedures, that Ozu inspires contemporary filmmaking and shows the way toward the cinema of the future. The writer goes on to discuss Ozu's influence on the work of several contemporary directors: Jim Jarmusch, Wayne Wang, Takeshi Kitano, Hou Hsiao-hsien, and Kore-eda." [Art Index]

<li>"An interview with filmmaker Jim Jarmusch on the occasion of the release of his film Ghost Dog. The film centers on a hitman engaged in a battle with his former mafiosi employers, who now wish to kill him. Jarmusch discusses a range of topics concerning the film, including how he went about writing the screenplay, his choice of Forest Whitaker for the role of the hitman, the inclusion of quotations from an 18th-century Japanese book entitled Livre du Samourai, how he based his portrayal of the gangster milieu on his own experience of living in a mafiosi neighborhood in New York, and the inclusion of obvious and less-obvious references to other films."

<li>"American independent filmmaker Jim Jarmusch began his career in 1980 with 'Permanent Vacation' and has since finished six movies. In his latest work, 'Dead Man,' Jarmusch dwelt on the life of an orphaned accountant, William Blake, as he journeys through life with a newfound Indian friend named Nobody. Jarmusch believes 'Dead Man' is spurred by numerous themes such as politics, violence, American history, spirituality, the poet William Blake, fame and being outlawed." [Expanded Academic Index]

<li>"Although "mainstream" used to be a dirty word for the in-vogue independent director Jim Jarmusch, he has created a potential hit with his new film Broken Flowers, which features Bill Murray in the leading role of Don Johnston. In his previous films, Jarmusch has invariably presented his characters on a take-them-or-leave-them basis, but this work indicates something else. In Murray, Jarmusch may very well have found his perfect actor." [Art Index]

<li>"Jim Jarmusch's new film follows a grey and jowly bachelor, played by Bill Murray, as he visits his former girlfriends to find out if it is true, as an anonymous letter claimed, that an ex-lover had a son by him 19 years previously. Broken Flowers riffs on themes of intimacy, emptiness, and disappointment in an extremely entertaining way. Steering clear of the more pretentious trappings of Jarmusch's earlier work, this is an elegant but accessible film." [Art Index]

<li>"With Coffee and Cigarettes, director Jim Jarmusch returns to an early portmanteau structure and sheds the pretensions of such recent films as Dead Man and Ghost Dog The Way of the Samurai. In 11 monochrome segments, which vary greatly in quality, performers talk while enjoying coffee, tea, and cigarettes. Overall, the work has the feel of a stopgap album of random B-sides, or a batch of DVD extras best enjoyed with the fast-forward button close to hand." [Art Index]

<li>"A review of Broken Flowers, a film by Jim Jarmusch. The film's central character, played by Bill Murray, is an aging success, unhappy in love, who is looking back on life. An anonymous letter informing him that he has a 19-year-old son sparks off a singularly reluctant mystery hunt to track down the boy's mother. Jarmusch, who wrote the film with Murray in mind, has refined his repertoire into a spare, solid kind of storytelling for this poignant and funny meditation on memory and loss. His famous patience for examining uneventful moments works well in Broken Flowers, establishing the strangeness of each life encountered by Murray's character, Don, and building the tension as the audience too is sucked up into Don's state of apophenia, seeing patterns or connections in possibly random or insignificant data."

<li>"Uses Jim Jarmusch's film Dead Man (1995) to analyze the dominant narratives of the American West and to consider how these narratives are articulated with the forms of Western capitalism. The film critiques the cult of the Western and seeks to secure the legitimacy of an alternative, local or "little" narrative through its deconstructive techniques. The film's pragmatics of narration work against hegemonic discourses of discovery and civilization, and the narrated journey is viewed through the downgrading, violation, and spoliation of indigenous peoples and territories. The film explores the cartographies of violence in the American (and Western capitalist) imaginary and narrates against the historical, political, economic, and symbolic erasure of Native Americans. Linked with this is an examination of the manner in which the film reflects on themes of spirituality, transience, and death. As a film of self-reflection, it is not solemn or merely politically correct but rather a comedy that mocks liberal platitudes while systematically divesting a moral economy of its narrative centrality and continuity."

<li>"A review of Dead Man, a film by Jim Jarmusch. Set in the American West, the film is structured as an epic film poem and concerns a journey taken by a man mistaken for the poet William Blake. This journey is not one of enlightenment or comprehension but is one of depletion, making it a more or less perfect metaphor for the aggressive, acquisitive core of American experience. The film's coarse humor is more than appropriate for a work centered on such an experience; it has a scathing edge and is supported by a unique historical realism. The film has the superreal physical impact of Murnau's journeys into abstraction." [Art Index]

<li>A review of director Jim Jarmusch's latest film Dead Man (1995). Set in 19th-century America and starring Johnny Depp, Robert Mitchum, and Gabriel Byrne, this film centers around a man who suffers from a series of hellish hallucinations. Without doubt Jarmusch's most exciting and daring film yet, Dead Man can be viewed as a poem about death that marks the genuine renaissance of this film director.

<li>"Writer-director Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man is a filmic rendition of the poet William Blake's life and thought. Jarmusch employs the conventions of the Western genre to construct visual and narrative analogues of some of the thorniest aspects of the poet's worldview. Just below the film's surface, a fairly conventional outlaw narrative, lies a visionary allegory of the soul's progress from physical death to spiritual transcendence, and one of the film's themes is a blessedly unsentimental attempt to come to terms with the historical substance of westward expansion. It particularly addresses the destruction of native populations and cultures and the dichotomy of wilderness versus civilization. Jarmusch's Blake (Johnny Depp) is the fiery poet who championed revolution and purifying violence, who attacked willful ignorance and hypocrisy, and who furiously denounced poverty, slavery, commerce, and the church. This Blake saw poetry as visionary truth, subversive, immensely powerful, and potentially life-changing." [Art Index]

~*OPENBRACKET*~i>Films in Review~*OPENBRACKET*~/i> July-August 1996 v47 n7-8 p86(2)
<li>A review of Dead Man, written and directed by Jim Jarmusch. This film is a crypto-Western concerning the hero William Blake, who, after being wounded in a shoot-out, embarks on an allegorical version of the vision quest. The film is far too self-consciously hip and its attempts at a quasi-mystical lyricism misfire. However, it is redeemed by its twilight, other-worldly atmosphere and its eccentric mix of literary and visual concepts.

Feb 2002 Volume: 15 Issue: 1 Page: 48 - 62
<li>Jim Jarmusch’s feature film Dead Man, apparently a Western, exceeds the genre’s traditional boundaries and shows ambivalence, unclear roles in an environment existing between the times of the nation’s founding and the success of civilisation. It shows a world in transformation where change is happening, not managed. The film is a provocation for adherents to traditional Western movies. But a closer look at this world offers a surprising insight into a dynamic involved in change processes that also occur after mergers or take-overs in contemporary business organisations. The charm in using the film as a metaphor is at least two-fold. The interpretation with the help of Lyotard and Baudrillard shows a double edged dynamic where the successful new owner after a take-over is not necessarily in charge of the game. Beyond that the use of a movie from outside the mainstream offers a non-mainstream argument inside the core of a mainstream management topic.

<li>"Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man will not disappoint those who appreciate his languorous, elegiac pacing. This film, however, lacks the implicit humanism that has so often gone unnoticed in Jarmusch's earlier works. There is something quite dispiriting about feeling that the father of modern American filmmaking has become subject to a Tarantinoesque strain of influence. Whatever disagreements the film's hazy morality and disregard for the sanctity of human life might provoke, however, it looks beautiful." [Art Index]</li>

<li>This film is marked by Jarmusch's familiar blend of warmth and cool-eyed distance, but in its broader picture, it can be frustratingly lazy. It is by turns funny and melancholic, sweet-centered and dark-edged. Jarmusch clearly finds observations easier than analysis, and the journey more fulfilling than the destination.

<li>"At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the social reality of one of popular culture's favorite figures-the gangster-is in decline. Similarly, the era of another late-twentieth-century gangster figure, the African American gangsta, also is waning. In the wake of a general truce between the Crips and Bloods gangs in many major cities, the gangsta street warrior culture no longer threatens social order the way it did 10 to 15 years ago. Despite the steady deterioration of gangster and gangsta life on the street, gangsters' imaginary lives thrive in film, television, fiction, music, and computer games. A unique mimesis between gangsters and their fictional representations enhances the popularity of gang narratives. This article examines two of these representations-The Sopranos, the HBO television series by David Chase, and Jim Marmusch's film Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai. Both present significant permutations of gangster mythology. A pragmatic portrayal of the Mafia in mainstream American culture, The Sopranos dramatizes the struggle of the middle-class American family as mob life. What The Sopranos is to family melodrama, Ghost Dog is to romance and drama of the gangsta as street warrior. Jarmusch uses the Eastern mythos of the samurai to depict a black man's mode of survival in late-twentieth-century urban America." [Communication Abstracts]

Ghost Dog is a professional assassin who is engaged in a battle with his former mafiosi employers who now wish to kill him. Likely to be killed at any moment, he has to call on all his resources to avoid death. Both the film and its central character present a cross between the past and the present and traditional and contemporary forms: The film presents known character types yet tries to find new incarnations for them, and Ghost Dog lives according to ancestral codes yet dresses like a rapper. The strength of this funny and melancholy film lies in the way Jarmusch presents the characters without ever stooping to caricature or parody." [Art Index]

<li>"	Jim Jarmusch is one of the few American directors to deal openly and repeatedly with questions of racial, ethnic, and religious heterogeneity, assimilation, and mistrust. He has been enthralled since his first major release with the notion of America as a multitude of independent and distinct ingredients, endemic, imported, and idiosyncratically hybrid. In his new film, Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, he changes the thematic focus slightly. Instead of considering people living in a land other than that of their birth, he focuses on people whose adherence to subcultures--hip-hop, the Mafia, and the code of the samurai--shows them as alien to the American mainstream. As in the earlier films but without their playful irony, the outsider in Ghost Dog is recompensed for his alienness with mistrust, persecution, suspicion, and nullification." [Art Index]

Forest Whitaker is Ghost Dog, a curtly cornrowed assassin-for-hire, who sees himself as a loyal defender of Louie, a Mafia underboss. The more Jarmusch drives his work toward philosophical extremes, embellished artiness, and curdly utopianisms, the less he is estranged from the paradox of high-mindedness and lowest common denominators."

<li>"Hollywood motion pictures are increasingly referencing Elvis or using his character. Jim Jarmusch's Mystery Train (1989) and Tony Scott's True Romance (1993) are two recent films reflective of the society's fascination with the King of Rock 'n' Roll. They reveal that Elvis remains the perfect symbol of cultural contradictions and displaced desires." [Expanded Academic Index]

<li>In O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Mystery Train the Coen brothers and Jim Jarmusch choose the state of Mississippi and the city of Memphis, Tennessee as the settings of their heroes' peregrinations. Music permeates Joel Coen's and Jim Jarmusch's cinematic spaces, so much that it influences their narrative and stylistic perspectives and structures their works. The aim of this paper is to examine how the Coen brothers' and Jarmusch's choice of the musical field as a territory for their reconstructions of the South enables them to collate distinct artistic domains and genres in their representations of "border incidents" between stories, legends and history.

<li>"Jim Jarmusch's Mystery Train is a witty and engaging film in which the director limits the action to a rundown area close to an Amtrak station in Memphis. Subtly yet insistently, Jarmusch invites the audience to consider this bluesy southern river town, with its racially mixed population, as a microcosm of the national and even global struggle to accommodate differences. The film is cool and camp, with droll ironies and dry humor, but it is at bottom a meditation on brotherhood." [Art Index]

<li>"Director Jim Jarmusch's Mystery Train is the final installment in a triptych of films. Like Stranger Than Paradise and Down By Law, the movie reveals Jarmusch's fascination with emotions and events that occur simultaneously without ever connecting directly. In Mystery Train, three separate groups of people--two Japanese tourists, an Italian woman and an American woman, and a trio of thugs--spend the night in separate rooms at a seedy hotel in Memphis, Tennessee, without crossing paths. The technique has been used before, in literature by William Faulkner and in film by Robert Altman, but Jarmusch uses it with more gentleness and deadpan humor." [Art Index]
