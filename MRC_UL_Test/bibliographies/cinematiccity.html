<li>"Los Angeles constitutes the very locus, spiritual font, and often the actual site of some of America's most cherished crime-movie fantasies. This is despite the fact that it is a city devoid of the topographical symbols and embedding of the past usually associated with detective narratives, especially film noir detective narratives. The writer examines what detective movies, from the postwar period to present day, have done with the ecology of L.A. and what L.A. has done with and to detective movies." [Art Abstracts]

<li>"This article takes popular cultural expressions as a window onto the transformation of the American city after World War II. First, it considers the film genre known as film noir as evidence of a larger perception of social disorder that ensued within the context of the centralized, modern city, which peaked at the turn of the century. Second, it turns to Disneyland as the archetypal example of a postwar suburban order, one that promised to deliver a respite from the racial and sexual upheaval that characterized the culture of industrial urbanism. Together, film noir and Disneyland illuminate the meanings assigned to the structural transformation of the mid-century American city and reveal the cultural underpinnings of a grass-roots conservatism that prized white suburban home ownership. Ultimately, this article emphasizes the interplay of structure and culture, demonstrating the linkage between how cities are imagined and how they are made." [Communications Abstracts]

<li>"Part of a special issue on fantastic films. The writer examines the symbolism of national monuments in this speculative genre. She notes that actual monuments or public architecture imbued with monumental importance work as metonyms of civic pride and power, as well as tacitly understood repositories of the country's "sacred" memories. As such, she claims that monuments are uniquely qualified to figure prominently in the "aesthetic of destruction." She explains that in movies such as Independence Day, the monument's facile destruction testifies to the great power of an alien race bent on bringing the nation or the world to its knees. She also analyzes a subgenre in which the monument is a signifier of the ravages brought about by time instead of aliens." [Art Index]

<li>"Part of a special section devoted to man-made modular megastructures. The film noir produced by Hollywood between 1941 and 1958 presented the image of a mental megalopolis. Hollywood's entertainment of urban audiences was often paradoxical, creating a negative counterpoint to modern life. This was especially so in film noir, a morbid melodrama reminding audiences of the dark side of prosperity and which contrasted with the big-budget Hollywood celebration of the American way. The writer goes on to discuss examples from film noir, the "neo-noir" revival that began in the mid-1970s, and the present day." [Art Index]

<li>"Part of a special section on architecture and motion pictures. The writer discusses the interplay of film and architecture in Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The chronological setting of the movie, its urban location, and the presence of replicants--an advanced form of robot--connect history, in the form of the future; architecture, in the form of Los Angeles and its urban environment; and the body, for example, in terms of the necessity to distinguish between replicant and human. The importance of this movie is that it allows a way of tracing a specific formation of these three elements, raising questions about the future and how it will be built." [Art Index]

These two domains, they suggest, may constitute a background to consider possible metaphors for VEs' design. Through the nature of drawings and virtual environments as means of representing three-dimensional spaces, they explore the relation between architecture and virtual reality technology. They then compare VEs and physical environments to our daily spatial experience in order to understand the intrinsic nature of VEs. This step is, they argue, essential in helping toward an understanding of how an architectural conception of designing spaces might be developed in the context of VEs. In conclusion, they present two directions toward informing VE design by means of theoretical and practical architectural design knowledge and consider the use of film-related studies as a means of enhancing our conception of time and movement in VEs."

<li>"Part of a special section on learning from architectural history. The intersection of urban culture, architecture, and film is an extremely fertile and productive area of research. After decades of literary domination, the field of cinema studies has joined in the spatial turn that cultural history and theory have recently taken. In turn, architectural practice and theory have adopted a mobilized, cinematic viewpoint, interacting in various ways with the discourse of moving images. The writer goes on to present four filmic "takes" on this vital intersection from her own perspective, discussing the topics of history and modernity, spatial critical theory, filmic and architectural promenades, and haptic design."

<li>"This article explores the attraction of underground railways as a setting in film through the detailed analysis of several films from the second half of the twentieth century. Opening with a discussion of the way the London Underground is used in the 1997 Ian Softley film, The Wings of the Dove, the article examines the cinematic spaces of the London Underground in both fiction and documentary film and television. Quatermass and the Pit (Roy Ward Baker, 1967) is discussed as an example of the one of the most common underground tropes, the eruption of horror from below ground, and this is contrasted with documentary films which present the tunnels of the underground as a place of work. Films discussed here include Philip Donellan's The Irishmen, Ralph Keene's Under Night Streets and Molly Dineen's Angel. It is suggested that the spaces of the underground are in some ways more analogous to cinematic spaces than has hitherto been recognised and that, for a public space, it is often represented as surprisingly private."

An introduction to the issue, which contains articles dealing with the city and its representations through moving images. Cinematic representation has changed alongside emergent urbanism in the 20th century, depicting these shifts in topography and human constitution and to some extent affecting them. Southern California can be taken as a paradigm for a different kind of urbanism--one increasingly dependent on the automobile, sprawling, and decentered. Moreover, Los Angeles is both a global center for media industries that increasingly affect contemporary life and the location of vigorous--though critically overlooked--"underground" film and video communities. The articles in this issue approach "Los Angeles" as a problem of representation, a site of film production, a tradition within the American avant-garde, and a kind of urban development under the influence of filmic representations."

<li>"A report on "Cinema and the City," a conference held at University College, Dublin, in March 1999, and a review of Anke Gleber's new book The Art of Taking a Walk. The conference featured three keynote speeches addressing, among other things, the history of the Irish film censors, the filmic role of Bunker Hill in Los Angeles, and the question of cinema and architecture. The event was made particularly valuable by the provocative connections that were made, which included the implication that architects could gain from careful consideration of film a far better understanding of the resonances of space and the profane, inventive semiotics of pedestrian movement. The issue of the arts and analytics of walking is also relevant to a reading of Gleber's book, which deals with flanerie as a mode of perception unique to, and expressive of, modernity. The writer discusses Gleber's account of a scene in Walter Ruttmann's film Berlin: the Symphony of the City, arguing that it demonstrates the productivity of thinking the city through cinema."

<li>"This paper historicizes American cities after the Second World War through the rich motif of noir literature and film. But, in doing so, the paper is also a critical consideration of noir's work in tudies. Noir has been drawn, often usefully but also unfortunately, away from its referents, from the terrain that it most directly summons but also from the spaces in which its contradictions are most apparent. Moving from a discussion of the distractions of Chinatown to contextual themes such as mobility and ruin, the paper links noir criticism and noir texts with broader debates in postwar urbanism and modernism. As just part of these discourses, noir not only is irreducible to certain essences, but can potentially perform the opposite role, challenging conventions of urban understanding and practice. The result would be a more detailed and subtle account of modernism's American geographies."

<li>This essay considers issues of the cinema, architecture, women, and the city by focusing on several production numbers directed by Busby Berkeley that are set within an urban environment: 'Lullaby of Broadway' (1935), '42nd Street' (1933), and 'I Only Have Eyes for You' (1934). Beyond reading the city's space and architecture as a gendered topos, the essay gestures toward connections between Berkeley's Hollywood productions and the history of French, Soviet, and German avant-garde cinemas.

<li>"In the early years of the cinema and into the 1910s and 1920s, it was less the film than cinema-going itself that attracted urban publics. In this era, people were enthusiastic about technology and the achievements ofm modernity; while at the same time they felt anxious about the rapid and radical changes in their social and economic life. IN Germany, this contradictory experience was especially harsh and perceptible in the urban metropolis of Berlin. The article demonstrates how within city life, Berlin cinemas - offering the excitement of innovation as well as optimal distraction and entertainment - provided an pace where, by cinema-going, appeal and uncertainty could be positively reconciled."

The writer discusses the relationship between architecture "as discourse" and the discursive experience of film. The writer attempts to rediscover architectural experience in terms of real spatial processes that can appear as operational difficulties within film; these filmic difficulties include the filmability of the city as a question of politics of spatial experience, which is highlighted as both a locus of film critique and an encounter with architecture. Scenes from three Greek movies are selected to exemplify spatial experience symptomatically to the film event and to the directing intentions of the films from which they were taken. The psychoanalytic concept of the Imaginary as a formative and dialectical instance for subjectivity is also discussed to enable a critical understanding of the image across film and architecture beyond the visual/countervisual paradigm."

In each of these films, on which thousands or millions of dollars were spent on elaborate miniature photography, viewers are treated to an aerial vista of a city into which they descend along with the protagonists. While the express ambition of the effects artists is to provide an illusion of a believable city viewed from above, the full pleasure of the film relies on its being seen as a set to be gazed at, beyond anything that either Disneyland or the 1939 World's Fair could offer. Rather than menacing viewers, the filmic miniature permits them to disarm and colonize troubling cultural spaces in what it suggests and omits of America's actual inner-city problems." [Art Index]

All representations of the American city in such movies mostly depend on two components: myth and history. Symbolized as the achievement of a noble humanity, the city is often presented as suffering from the harsh assaults of a hostile and alien identity: monsters or extraterrestrial beings. A second representation, depicting the cities under nightmarish features, came later and is related to the recent evolution of American cities. In such movies as Blade Runner, Invasion Los Angeles, Terminator, and Robocop, the enemy is no more an extraneous entity, but spreads out from the corrupted heart of the decaying city. One can see in this interiorization of the evil forces threatening the city dwellers the long way covered since the confident days of the consumer society to the present-day fears of American life."

<li>"Part of a special issue exploring film and video in relation to architecture and pace. The writer discusses the choice of locations for murder in films set in Los Angeles. There are urban "requirements" for a location where a murder should take place, with a good crime scene identifying poverty as local color for murder. This visual imagery of the decaying inner city has reinforced a Victorian panic about ethnicity and class as well as strengthening illusions about where crime-ridden cities end and safe suburbs start. The noir location thus reflects the perversities of consumer panic as a way to hide urban realities, a paradox that gives noir its presence and power. It seems that key locations for L.A. movie murders require two elements: A nearby consumer monument and a patina that reinforces the false memories of Los Angeles." [Art Index]

<li>"From its early years to the present, Johannesburg has escaped the strictures of literary as well as civil decorum. The city has appeared to planners and artists alike to be unimaginable as well as unmanageable. While the deep divisions of apartheid Johannesburg inspired the clear-cut conflicts of anti-apartheid drama, the more ambiguous fractures of the contemporary city have lent themselves to the creation of vivid but elliptical narratives of shifting alliances more suited to the montage and mise en sc?ne of cinema. A few feature-length films with international distribution, such as Jump the Gun (1996) and Fools (1997), have generated multiple readings to the exclusion of smaller, more experimental films such as The Foreigner (1997) and A Drink in the Passage (2002) or the television series The Line (1994) and Gaz'Lam (2002 ff.) whose association with television, whether through funding or production for serial broadcast, has apparently kept them from critical view. This article redresses that balance with close analysis and contextual relocation of cinematic and televisual representations of Johannesburg, the edgy city." [Project Muse]

Their relationships to the city they love are, however, basically different. Scorsese's mise en sc&egrave;ne brings out the conflict between the city and the often marginal antagonists in search of themselves and of success; Woody Allen's protagonists tell about their perfect urban integration. The two visions of the city may not be superimposed. Scorsese's camera, starting from Little Italy, explores all five boroughs; Allen feels more comfortable in Manhattan, especially around Central Park, with occasional excursions to Brooklyn. Both filmmakers use the roofs of New York in similar ways, in homage to the Hollywood tradition. Yet they diverge in their original uses of bridges, the El, and the Manhattan skyline. Two contrasting symbolic images emerge. Allen's small town, filmed and loved as a woman, is a unique place where nature is integrated into the heart of civilization. In Scorsese's New York, there is no place for couples; it is a city not unlike Los Angeles, an abstract asphalt jungle that symbolizes all cities." [America: History and Life]

<li>"It has been suggested that the modern city, which bombards its inhabitants with a rapid succession of fragmentary visual images, trained its city-dwellers in the viewing habits required by the cinema. This article explores the dual fascination with urban life and the cinema in the Spanish avant-garde of the late 1920s, in the light of Huyssen's suggestion that the avant-garde was a reaction against modernism's attempt to distance itself from the rise of mass culture which accompanied urbanization."

The objective of the course is to expand the students' understanding of both how people respond to life in cities and how this response is in fact influenced by the images they see depicted in film. Striking arguments can be made that our willingness to address urban problems is influenced by our history of such popular images. This paper outlines the authors' experience with the course, indicating both the pedagogical benefits and scholarly value of such an approach."

The Spanish architectural styles of residences, the seediness of downtown Los Angeles, exotic landscaping, the river channel, the Hollywood Bowl, and industrial locations were featured in these films and usually given a dark interpretation, as Los Angeles came to represent disillusionment with the American Dream."

Summary 	"Yosefa Loshitzky challenges the utopian notion of a post-national "New Europe" by focusing on the waves of migrants and refugees that some view as a potential threat to European identity, a concern heightened by the rhetoric of the war on terror, the London Underground bombings, and the riots in Paris's banlieues. Opening a cinematic window onto this struggle, Loshitzky determines patterns in the representation and negotiation of European identity in several European films from the late 20th and early 21st centuries, including Bernardo Bertolucci's Besieged, Stephen Frears's Dirty Pretty Things, Mathieu Kassovitz's La Haine, and Michael Winterbottom's In This World, Code 46, and The Road to Guantanamo." -- Back cover.

<li>"Part of a special section on production and set design in filmmaking. The function of architecture-as-resonator is endlessly explored in French poetic realist cinema of the 1930s. Seminal films like Le Quai des brumes (Marcel Carne, 1938), La Bete humaine (Jean Renoir, 1938) and Le Jour se leve (Marcel Carne, 1939) are not only powerfully anchored to recognizable, normally urban, landscapes, but they also depend heavily on atmospheric milieux and spatial specifics to explore deeper levels of meaning embedded in the narrative. This specific strand of 1930s French decor is deemed inherently performative, whereby a reciprocal transfer between individual and decor serves as an interpretative matrix for each film. It is a decor that "speaks", paraphrasing the concerns of the narrative and architecturally mirroring the mental states and emotions of the characters inhabiting them." [Art Index]

Andrzej Wajda's Man of Marble (1976), explains the mechanism behind the propaganda and production of a new settlement, Nova Huta.

<li>This article makes use of Darko Suvin's theory of the novum and Raymond Williams's cultural materialism to analyse three urban-dystopian science  fiction films: Fritz Lang?s Metropolis (1927), Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982) and Alex Proyas's Dark City (1998). It argues for the central significance of utopia, dystopia and  cinema to SF. It explores the themes of class and gender, the uses of intertextuality, and the representations of the human and the posthuman in these three films. Drawing on Jameson, Baudrillard and others, it argues that the first film exhibits a characteristically modern, the latter two different versions of a  characteristically postmodern, structure of feeling?.

<li>"The writer critically assesses the trope of the 19th-century flaneur/flaneuse as found in William Wyler's Roman Holiday (1953) and Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation (2003). She states that both of these films build a traditional narrative from the adventures of a single female protagonist as she negotiates urban terrain. She suggests that in tracing the references to the flaneur/flaneuse in the films, it is possible to begin to map a trajectory of contemporary gender relations in respect to pace from the post-World War II era to the present, as well as to comprehend the context in which the city itself is viewed as a site for such transformations."

The writer examines the relationship between architecture and motion pictures. He aims to establish a context of interest in the world of cinema for architects and particularly architectural students. He explores studio work as "natural film sets" using the example of experiments with architectural projects developed by students from the Department of Architecture at the University of Cambridge, England. He reports on the modes of representation used--drawings, physical models, and computer animation. He concludes that these means could offer an interesting starting point for the motion pictures industry, particularly for storyboarding, while the architect can learn from the filmmaker's ability to represent and move through spaces."

<li>"This article argues that contemporary portrayals of cityscapes on television create a "postcard effect," a way of seeing that affords the viewer the pleasureofa tourist gaze. This disposition both reflects and legitimizes a fragmented experience of visiting a location without immersing oneself in the intricacies of its politics and geography. Building on critical tudies, film theory, semiotics, and critical ethnography, this article analyzes depictions of New York City in five television shows (Seinfeld, Friends, Sex and the City, Felicity, and The Sopranos) to demonstrate how metonymic representations of the city produce a narrative of a tourist destination on display."

Pratt, Geraldine. <li>"Virtual Cities: Film and the Urban Mapping of Virtual Space." ~*OPENBRACKET*~i>Screen~*OPENBRACKET*~/i>. 43(3):250-70. 2002 Autumn <li>"he writers discuss three films that work out the fears and promises of cyberspace in relation to a particular model of the city. The Net, directed by Irwin Winkler, focuses mostly on fears surrounding the Internet's ability to erode both private and public spaces, but it ultimately repudiates electronic space and returns the viewer to a version of the modern city, sharply divided between "the crowd" and domesticity. Hackers, directed by Ian Softley, attempts to elaborate a more optimistic image of the Internet through notions of the transparent modernist city. In Strange Days, directed by Kathryn Bigelow, virtual reality promises reembodiment and integration beyond the fragmentation of the city. These contemporary films about the Internet are troubling because they provide no stable place for women or nonwhite citizens within the space of the Internet. They may display a certain "truth" about gendered, racialized, and class access to electronic space, but they do nothing to problematize it." [Art Index]

In 1920s Germany, the Expressionist impulse transferred itself from the canvas on to the cinema screen, resulting in some of the most dramatic works of film architecture. The formulations of Expressionist paintings, which fought against impressionistic superficiality and illuminated agitated inner worlds, were realized in German Expressionist films in which the heroes roam through a labyrinth of narrow alleys that can represent both a medieval city and a spiritual space that has become visible. In The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, the major film in this genre, the architecture consists of narrow, high rooms and lanes, inside and out, a labyrinth that is completely enclosed and apparently inescapable. Subsequent film spaces and architecture have evolved from the Expressionist space-cell. Indeed, in a number of films, including Metropolis, Key Largo, and Blade Runner, the chosen space, building, or city often becomes the leading character." [Art Abstracts]

This implies two levels of representation: the photographic images, partly shot in Los Angeles studios, are traces of an objective reality that, in its turn, the story invests with specific meanings. The opening sequence of The Birds, for instance, includes real pictures of cable cars in Union Square, but also introduces a special way of looking at them that connects birds with Melanie's physical presence. This leads to the question: what is the influence of San Francisco's actual as well as mythical history - and the use fiction has made of them - on the images the films convey?"

<li>"A discussion on the portrayal of agricultural life in France in the 1950s seen through the works of amateur cinematographers and government propaganda films is presented. The 1950s was a period when rural-urban migration was increasing. Despite substantial productivity increases due to modern farming methods, many farmers were still impoverished. The films depicting agricultural life were made to discourage rural migration to the cities and the traditional rural values of agricultural people were presented in a positive light. The positive and often idealistic portrayals of French rural society were, however, filmed at a time when traditional rural life was becoming antiquated." [Expanded Academic Index]

Each of the films on show responds in its own way to the experiences and ethics of the industrial urban population between the wars. In Metropolis, Fritz Lang has a monumental, objective view of the city and its inhabitants, while Dziga Vertov's machine eye in Man With A Movie Camera comes at the subject from all angles. The attitudes of F. W. Murnau's Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans and the 1913 film Traffic in Souls have been rehashed again and again in films that are half censorious, half titillated by the mores of the decadent city. Such cheap thrills may soon be a thing of the past, as suburbia begins to replace the inner city as the main psychological battlefield of American films." [Art Index]

(from panorama and diorama to Le Corbusier's Philips Pavilion at Expo '58)~*OPENBRACKET*~i> A-+-U~*OPENBRACKET*~/i> no282 Mar 1994. p. 94-111 <li>"The writer traces a history of the relationship between visual media and architecture. The Panorama- and Diorama-buildings created between 1780 and 1840 used photorealistic painting to achieve perfect simulation of such scenes as land- and cityscapes. The form of these buildings was derived strictly from their function; they thus became the models for a wide variety of 20th-century media-oriented building types for motion pictures, exhibitions, concerts, and fairs. With the advent of film, special architectural models or semi-permanent architectures were created, while architectonic imagery also began to appear in film itself. The most important example of this development is Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1926), which combines architecture with light and movement. Making extensive use of glass and skeleton construction, Mies van der Rohe's architecture can also be interpreted as a exploitation of dramatic light effects, while Le Corbusier's Philips pavilion at the 1 958 Brussels world exposition was erected as a "Poeme Electronique," a complex structure creating a virtual space surrounded by sequences of images, colors, and sounds. Current experiments with cyberspace and architecture explore a multimedia synthesis of art and architecture." [Art Index]

The beauty of many films featuring the built environment lies in their power to influence viewers' perception and perhaps to invoke a desire for a better architectural environment. The architect is also a cult figure of the 1990s, used by filmmakers when they want to demonstrate a sense of determination, drive, direction, passion, self-motivation, and perhaps a certain sense of arrogance in their characters."

<li>"The portrayal of city space in photographer Paul Strand's and painter Charles Sheeler's 1921 documentary film 'Manhatta' is analyzed. By focusing on architectural and technological abstractions, the film denied cultural and other social differences. This reveals elements of early twentieth century American thought about cities and of modernism." [Expanded Academic Index]

<li>"The writer discusses the transformation of Eastern Europe urbanism in three filmic instances. Dziga Vertov's Man With A Movie Camera (1929), was a formally radical film that captured, or perhaps more precisely, constructed an image of the Soviet City. Andrzej Wajda's Man of Marble (1976), explains the mechanism behind the propaganda and production of a new settlement, Nova Huta. Finally, Krzysztof Kieslowski's Decalogue is organized around the housing block, which becomes a stylized representation of the everday life of its inhabitants." [Art Index]

<li>"A close reading of the final scenes in F. W. Murnau's film Nosferatu (1922). During his death scene, the vampire Nosferatu seems to address the houses behind the curtain frame. These covert exchanges between living subjects and inanimate objects are characteristic of the symptoms of modern animation (with animation understood as the transference of energy from a semi-depleted animate subject to its surrounding architecture). With his left hand on his heart and his right hand connected to his houses, the transparent Nosferatu is turned into the center of an energy circuit, as if his own inanimation is feeding into the buildings' animism. The writer goes on to discuss related issues in German art and architecture from the period." [Art Index]

<li>"Visual-effects supervisor Paul Franklin explains how a virtual city was created for Christopher Nolan's new film Batman Begins. Much of the film was shot in Chicago, and the digital shots were matched with digital architecture to create Bruce Wayne's hometown. Every building is a faithful reproduction of a real building in the city, with the exception of Wayne Tower, which is imaginar, though all of its components were taken from observed reality. Franklin explains how both a big aerial shot of the city and close-ups of buildings were filmed." [Art Index]

<li>"This paper explores Ayn Rand and King Vidor's depiction of a gendered and politicized architectural discourse in the film The Fountainhead (1949), which was based on the writer's best-selling novel. The film has been examined in the contexts of Frank Lloyd Wright's influence and the impact of European modernism on the set designs. This paper expands on the work of previous scholars by considering the effects of such diverse modern architecture, theoreticians, critics, and builders as Wright, Louis Sullivan, Le Corbusier, Sheldon Cheney, and the Starett Brothers, among others, on Rand. New evidence in the Rand Archives and the Warner Brothers Archives also establishes the manner in which she appropriated architectural source materials in the service of her conservative, gender-inflected political agenda. Rand employed these sources in all aspects of the project, including plot construction, character delineation, and the depiction of the profession. Characters are signified by building types (e.g., skyscraper, housing project) or stylistic analogues, which represent their economic or political philosophies. An analysis of Rand's screenplay, her architectural borrowings, and the film's mise en scene elucidates her ideological and prescriptive agenda, namely the destruction of New Deal cooperation and subsidies, which are signified by public housing, in favor of capitalist economics, which are epitomized by skyscrapers."

<li>"How digital technologies are perceived to transform the film medium is one of the key questions associated with modern science fiction and fantasy film. The linearity and fixed temporal rhythms of film may be replaced by the potentially fragmented rhythms of digital culture. This apparent transformation of cinematic constructions of time and memory reworks our understanding of what it means to be human. With its frequent meditations on definitions of the human and its use of special effects, the science fiction genre serves as a useful guide for exploring these questions. The 1998 Alex Proyas' film "Dark City" is used to consider the relationship between digitized constructions of cinematic time and the construction of the human." [IIPA]
