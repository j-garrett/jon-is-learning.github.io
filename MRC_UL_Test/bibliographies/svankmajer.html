</li><li>An interview with Czech surrealist filmmaker Jan Svankmajer. Among the subjects he discusses is his attraction to the subject material of his latest film, the film's handling of the folktale idea of a child being threatened by an ogre or wild beast, and the function of two-dimensional animation in the film.

</li><li>"A lifelong surrealist, Czech filmmaker Jan Svankmajer creates work that tends to resist political interpretations, instead inhabiting a twilight world of childhood nightmares, gothic tales, found objects, animated jetsam, old bones, and cannibal orgies. BFI's Jan Svankmajer--The Complete Short Films divides Svankmajer's films into "Early Shorts" (1964-72) and "Late Shorts" (1979-92). The seven-year gap in output occurred because of state objections to the director's work on Leonardo's Diary, crucially, not to the content but the method. One of the three discs in the set contains a wealth of extras, including Emil Radok's 1958 puppet film Johanes Doktor Faust, on which Svankmajer worked and which shows some of the directions he would later take; extracts from Oldrich Lipsky's Nick Carter in Prague (1977), for which Svankmajer created a giant man-eating plant; and an extract from a Czech TV series featuring a 2001 interview with Svankmajer."

Svankmajer was originally a theater director; his experiences with the mixed-media work of the Lanterna Magika theater in Prague gave rise to his early filmmaking experiences. His long-time involvement with sculpture and college is reflected in his animation: An exceptionally rich physical texture is introduced into scenarios that always try to blur the boundaries between live action and animation, theater and life, illusion and reality."

</li><li>"Part of a special issue on animation. The writer compares Walt Disney's 1951 animated film Alice in Wonderland with Jan Svankmajer's 1988 live-action and animation film Alice. In terms of design and content, the Disney version closely follows Lewis Carroll's story--the character designs were influenced by the drawings of Sir John Tenniel, who illustrated the original novel. Although Disney excels in literally translating the work, Svankmajer captures its spirit much more successfully--he shows the experience of a young girl in an environment both familiar and alien, which is what the novel describes. Disney's sound and visuals create a realm that is ultimately happy and self-affirming; Svankmajer's world is highly absurd, ugly, physically and mentally challenging, and scary. Disney created a film within the boundaries of the Hollywood studio system, where the familiar is continually presented to attract an established market; Svankmajer is an experimental Eastern European artist guided by the possibilities of cinema as a subversive medium capable of redefining our conception of reality."

</li><li>"The writer examines the work of Czech animator Jan Svankmajer, focusing on Faust. He points out that Svankmajer's work shows the influence of two major art trends--Surrealism, which has survived in Czechoslovakia since the early 1930s, and the overwrought and technically exuberant Mannerism that found one of its greatest expressions in the bizarre paintings of Arcimboldi. He notes that the film's action moves between puppets, animated models, and "real" actors to create a brilliant mix out of the traditional marionette theater of Eastern Europe and life in post-communist Prague. He contrasts Svankmajer's version to the versions of Goethe and Marlowe, concluding that Svankmajer offers a series of Fausts who imply that within the contemporary world, all of us are capable of being manipulated by the demons of chance and petty ambition."

</li><li>"In Faust, Jan Svankmajer borrows from sources that include Marlowe, Goethe, Gounod, and the more obscure Grabbe to shape a narrative that is entirely his own. A cascade of improvisation springs from each borrowing, as when a volley of tiny demons dismember the equally miniscule angels who are trying to prevent Faust from signing away his soul. In fact, so much of it is Svankmajer that the story of Faust only really gets started halfway through the film." [Art Index]</li>

</li><li>"Svankmajer's black comedy is his most conventional film by a long way. However, because it eschews most of the visual flourishes that have made his work so distinctive, it risks appearing like any other low budget Czech horror movie. It is saved from banality by its underlying satirical zest." [Art Index]

</li><li>"A review of Jan Svankmajer's 2005 film Lunacy. Svankmajer's fifth feature is confrontational from the opening moments, when the director appears before a white backdrop to deliver both a personal credo and an introduction in which he calls his film as an "infantile" tribute to Edgar Allan Poe and the Marquis de Sade. Indeed, Svankmajer takes his raw material from Poe's stories "The Premature Burial" and "The System of Dr. Tarr and Professor Fether," the latter of which provides the asylum setting and the ideological debate about how best to deal with insanity. The gruesome solutions proffered by the character of Dr. Coulmiere (played by Martin Huba), however, clearly draw on de Sade. As usual, Svankmajer is keenly aware of his material's tactile nature, and his images are certain to provoke a powerfully visceral reaction in the viewer." [Art Index]

</li><li>"A review of Lunacy (Sileni), the latest film by the Czech surrealist filmmaker and artist Jan Svankmajer. With a central theme of the dialectic between liberty and control, this feature film combines animation and live action in a narrative that is apparently set in France in a hybrid period merging the 19th century and the present. Svankmajer himself opens Lunacy by describing it as a horror film and "an infantile tribute" to Edgar Allan Poe and the Marquis de Sade. Throughout the film, the screen is invaded by stop-motion-animated stampedes of meat, tongues, eyeballs, and bones. With its murky, rough-grained photography and constrained framing, and its often truly repulsive imagery, Lunacy mixes the claustrophobic logic of nightmare with the fevered, bargain-basement playfulness of the Hammer cycle."
