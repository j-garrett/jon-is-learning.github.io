</li><li>"Part of a special issue devoted to the notion of borders as addressed by contemporary art. A discussion of the recent documentary work of Chantal Akerman. In this work, Akerman's attention to gender, cultural, and historical difference is always explored through aesthetic means, therefore providing a fruitful alternative to the rhetoric of ethnographic film as conceived within documentary realism's framework. Through her hyperbolic use of formal devices, Akerman is able to effect and extend the film medium's materiality to the subjects and objects both in and outside her films. Her experimental ethnographic projects are informed by her placing of film's materiality at the service of referentiality--thereby enacting a division within her practice between the material and the referential, the literal and the symbolic, the indexical and the abstract. The writer goes on to discuss Akerman's ethnographic projects D'Est (1993), a film shot in Germany, Poland, and Russia; and De l'autre cote&lt;/EM%&gt; (2002), a film shot on both sides of the Mexican-American border."

</li><li>"The writer discusses issues of displaced memory and indirect Jewish identity in Chantal Akerman's 1996 film D'Est (From the East). The Holocaust created a distinct and traumatic before and after for generations of post-Holocaust Jews. The effect for Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern European descent is that "the old country" becomes an imaginary construct with no actual geographical correlate. In D 'Est, in which she goes "back" to Eastern Europe, the region where her parents lived until World War II, Akerman attempts to reach across the divide while simultaneously conceding the futility of the gesture. Not only is her method indirect but her memory is as well; it is in effect her mother's memory that weighs on Akerman as if it were her own. The writer shows how, with this appropriation of another's memory, there is an extended sense of self at work that challenges commonly held conceptualizations of individual memory as well as any narrow definition of autobiography."

Her installation combined video quotations from the films 'Jeanne Dielman,' '1080 Bruxelles,' '23 Quai du Commerce' and 'D'Est,' with a novella-length text entitled 'A Family in Brussels, 1998' functioning as an ambient voice-over. Akerman's cinematography was compelling due to its reliance on attenuated movement and muted color." [Expanded Academic Index]

</li><li>"Chantal Akerman's 1986 musical Window Shopping is discussed. This film is set in an indoor shopping mall where everything is about display and appearances, and where its characters work and play, sing and dance, and, above all, gossip and flirt, their behavior conforming to stereotypes of romance and retail sales alike. It suggests an equation between deadpan postmodern irony, the ubiquitous commodification of all forms of self-expression, and the conventional nature of the signs that represent our feelings both to others and, perhaps most crucially, to ourselves. This point is already made in Akerman's 1983 film The Eighties, which she made as a sort of demo tape for it, and which contains many sequences that correspond closely to the ones in it, albeit to a very different effect: The earlier film illustrates the process of construction of feelings and roles, and this one shows those feelings and roles already constructed."

</li><li>"A review of La Captive, a film by Chantal Akerman. An adaptation of Proust's La Prisonniere, this film represents and dramatizes Simon's obsession with Ariane. Akerman approaches the film via an unpredictable and roundabout route, by way of Hitchcock and Kubrick but above through the modes of modern cinema of the 1970s, the accents of which can be seen in the interaction of the actors, the choice of sequence shots, and the real-life representation of frontality and violence. The fascination of the film comes, among other things, from the miraculous balance of all its parts." [Art Index]

</li><li>"Chantal Akerman's La Captive completely respects and engages with the spirit of the novel it is based on, which more than makes up for it not being literally faithful. The film is a free update of Marcel Proust's The Prisoner, generally regarded as the least adaptable section of Remembrance of Things Past. Akerman has changed the names of the two main characters, and viewers unfamiliar with Proust's work could leave the film without suspecting its origins. To make an extreme simplification, The Prisoner is a novel in which nothing happens, or in which something is happening but the reader never knows exactly what. Instead of attempting to fill the novel's deliberate gaps, Akerman seizes on them to proffer her unique poetic vision." [Art Index]

</li><li>" The writer discusses the influences on Chantal Akerman's film La Captive. This film is almost a thriller, and its dramatic mise en scene of obsession and wandering recalls Alfred Hitchcock's film Vertigo and Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. It deviates significantly from the novel by Proust, La Prisonniere, from which it is adapted. Through this work, Akerman has shown that adaptation is not a translation but a montage." [Art Index]

</li><li>"Akerman's Proust adaptation is made more difficult by her choice of one of his most difficult volumes, setting it in the present, and filming it in her trademark minimalist style. While her film obsessively pursues the "mystery" of lesbian desire, she keeps Proust's male viewpoint and only offers ambiguous answers. The characters are reduced to ciphers, which is reflected in dull performances." [Art Index]

</li><li>"The writer engages in a Deleuzian reading of Chantal Akerman's film News From Home (1976). The film is a 90-minute image-track comprising a series of mostly static shots of New York City, never showing the mother-daughter relationship alluded to in the letters that Akerman recites in voiceover. Stephen Heath, in his Questions of Cinema, reads the film in terms of absence based on its lack of sutures using a shot/reverse-shot sequence or central character. Equally, feminist-influenced readings of the film tend to imprison it in a stereotypical psychoanalytic interpretation based around the dichotomy of intimacy and claustrophobia of the mother-daughter relationship. In contrast, it is possible to read Heath's emphasis on absence through a Deleuzian framework to answer Heath's "impossible question of a woman's desire" with the actuality of affective sensations whose movement liberates the spectator from the constraints of identification."
