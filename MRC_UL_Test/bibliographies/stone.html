Stone's work on the Vietnam War - Platoon (1986) and Born on the Fourth of July (1989) - and contemporary domestic corruption - 1987's Wall Street - are simplistic morality plays that too easily blame the horrors of war and the amorality of investment deals on dark forces within American capitalism. The Doors (1991) romanticizes the hedonism of the 1960's. JFK (1992) overwhelms viewers with unsupported conspiracy theories and dishonestly ignores or changes evidence to suit Stone's whims. Especially in JFK, Stone employs references to history's supposed mythic qualities to excuse his turning history into antimilitaristic wish fulfillment." [ABC-CLIO, America: History and Life]

His most recent film, The Doors, offered him a chance to indulge his "bad-boy" persona. Stone says that with the film, he sought to capture the rhythm of his youth. In an interview, he discusses his years in Vietnam, his youthful experimentation with marijuana and LSD, the 1960s counterculture movement, Doors singer Jim Morrison, and the making of The Doors."

</li><li>"In the late 1980s and 1990s, American popular culture has been increasingly rife with conspiracy narratives of recent historical events. Among cultural producers, filmmaker Oliver Stone has had a significant impact on popular understanding of American culture in the late twentieth century through a series of docudramas which reread American history through the lens of conspiracy theory and paranoia. This paper examines the films of Oliver Stone&#45;in particular Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July, JFK, and Nixon&#45;asking why they have achieved popularity and brought about catharsis, why they are the subject of attack, and why it is useful to look beyond the debate about truth and falsehood that has surrounded them. It analyzes the ways in which Stone's status as a Vietnam veteran allowed Platoon to be accorded the authenticity of survivor discourse, whereas JFK and Nixon were subject to almost hysterical attack, not only because of Stone's assertions of conspiracy, but also because of his cinematic style of tampering with famous images. Taking these films as its point of departure, this paper examines the role of images in the construction of history, the form of the docudrama, the reenactment of historical images, fantasies of history, and ways in which paranoia part of the practice of citizenship."

</li><li>"A review of Oliver Stone's 2004 film Alexander. In defiance of the conventions of the Hollywood biopic, this film puts the historian in charge because it is framed by Alexander the Great's general Ptolemy and his voice-over dictation, recurring at turning points along the way. Sadly, Ptolemy interrupts the action in dramaturgical terms and adds nothing to the plot (or lack thereof) every time he comes on-screen. The film sacrifices the drama expected in biopics to the merest hint at "history-speaking" through this annoying voice-over, while failing entirely to interest audiences much in someone who was surely not so dull--if he was, surely Stone could have used poetic license. Stone should have fired historical consultant Robin Lane Fox, dispensed with Ptolemy and his droning history, and hired historian Hayden White, who could have gotten on with the plot." [Art Index]

</li><li>"An interview with director Oliver Stone on the occasion of the release of his latest film, Alexander. Stone explains the appeal of Alexander the Great for him. Responding to the suggestion that his boldest interpretive step, in a historical sense, with the film is to attempt a psychological analysis of what motivated Alexander's actions, he explains his belief that there is no way to tell this story in a linear fashion. He identifies the reasons behind his portrayal of Olympias, Alexander's mother, for which he has been criticized. Other topics discussed include the film's battle scenes, the portrayal of Alexander's bisexuality, and the kind of impression of Alexander he would like audiences to take away from the film."

</li><li>"Although Oliver Stone's epic about Alexander the Great invites cheap jokes about hair dye and accents, it is the film's storytelling problems that are by far the more serious. The film is narrated retrospectively by Ptolemy, and his recollection monopolizes the narrative--for example, when there are plots against Alexander they are not really dramatized. Instead of audiences seeing conspirators whispering in corners and such like, the voice-over bluntly states that this is what happened. As a result, the film has none of the intrigue that is fundamental to many classical epics; there is no dramatic depth in the movie, no subplots to give ballast to the account of Alexander's creation of a vast empire."

The NFL, with its distinctly American blend of brutal trench warfare on the field and smooth spin-doctoring in the skyboxes, is a subject ideally suited to the mercurial temperament of Stone, whose vehemence as a provocateur is matched by his sheer visual nerve. Stone discusses several topics in the interview, including what excited him about pro football on both a thematic and visual level; how, together with production designer Victor Kempster, cinematographer Sal Totino, and producer Clayton Townsend, he formed a visual strategy for presenting the game in a fresh and exciting way; his intentions in using technical innovations like the Image Shaker, the "Ratcam," and the bungee cam; and the technical challenges involved in making the film."

</li><li>"The writer discusses national and gender identity in Oliver Stone's film Born on the Fourth of July. The narrative of the film criticizes traditional myths of masculinity based on the idea of "punitive agency," attempting to revise the gender dynamic of national identity through the metaphor of woman as nation. However, its melodramatic conventions and structures assert the significance of the masculine role in the changing national narrative; the male hero gains authority by "rescuing" the nation from its own weakness, thus reaffirming to some extent the tradition forms of gender identity as the main perspective through which national identity is realized. The film can thus be seen as an exemplary manifestation of the complexity of the Vietnam narrative, wherein the most important questions of national and gender identity, and the narrative forms that convey and strengthen them, are arranged into new and shifting configurations."

The film touches on some of the most emotional moments in Kovic's life, including the inhuman treatment he suffered in squalid military hospitals, a drunken battle with his mother, his attempts to shout down Richard Nixon at the 1972 Republican Convention in Miami, and his triumphant speech at the 1976 Democratic Convention.

</li><li>"Author Abstract: In the late 1980s and 1990s, American popular culture has been increasingly rife with conspiracy narratives of recent historical events. Among cultural producers, filmmaker Oliver Stone hashad a significant impact on popular understanding of American culture in the late twentieht century through a series of docudramas which reread American history through the lens of conspiracy theory and paranoia. This paper examines the films of Oliver Stone - in particular Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July, JFK, and Nixon - asking why they have achieved popularity and brought about catharsis, why they are the subject of attack, and why it is useful to look beyond the debate about truth and falsehood that has surrounded them. It analyzes the ways in which Stone's status as a Vietnam veteran allowed Platoon to be accorded the authenticity of survivor discourse, whereas JFK and Nixon were subject to almost hysterical attack, not only because of Stone's assertions of conspiracy, but also because of his cinematic style of tampering with famous images. Taking these films as its points of departure, this paper examines the role of images in the construction of history, the form of the docudrama, the reenactment of historical images, fantasies of history, and ways in which paranoia is part of the practice of citizenship."

</li><li> Jim Morrison's poetry permits analysis of how and why Oliver Stone made 'The Doors.' Morrison regarded cinema as a spectacle and as a means allowing spectators to live out voyeuristic impulses. Stone was clearly influenced by Morrison's points of view, since the film treated Morrison as a mythic figure under the influence of visions, hallucinatory drugs, and promiscuity. 'The Doors' is a tribute to Morrison's poetry and its exploratory character.

The purpose of these vietnam War films is not to inform the unwitting about the Amerasian or Eurasian reality but to exalt the U.S. victory in the Vietnam War.

</li><li> 'JFK' offers two conspiracy theories on the assassination of John F. Kennedy. One is the assassination plot itself and the other is the cover-up. The film offers only a hypothesis, but one based on comprehensive documentation of which many of its critics seem unaware. In fact, 'JFK' is so cerebral that major actors have to be signed on to give viewers something familiar to focus on. Its aim is not so much to pinpoint the conspirators as to urge viewers to at least turn from the Warren Commission report in favor of their own research and perhaps question the government's idea of covert operations.</li></ul></li><li><h4>Crowdus, Gary. </h4><ul><li>"Getting the Facts Straight."

</li><li> Oliver Stone succeeds in integrating both conventional and radical cinematic devices in his movie 'JFK.' These devices include brief cameos by well-known actors, flashbacks and flashforwards, intercutting of real and recreated television news footage, mixing factual with speculative scenes and classic-style revelatory monologues. The result is a fragmentary sequence of scenes that nevertheless conveys the theme coherently and forcefully, that a web of conspiracy was behind John F. Kennedy's assassination.

'JFK' suggests that secret state-big business conspirators were behind John F. Kennedy's assassination.

</li><li> Oliver Stone's motion picture 'JFK' has received scathing criticism from the press and other segments of society, while at the same time stirring patriotic sentiments with some. The motion picture is based on the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Many feel the movie's underlying theme is unfounded, and that the film is heavy with political innuendos aimed at the US government. Most political analysts have dismissed 'JFK's' thesis as a fallacy, a mere manifestation of Stone's outrage at America's involvement in the Vietnam war, which he has nurtured since the Woodstock days.

</li><li> Author Abstract: Oliver Stone's JFK is a mythopoetic discourse that functions as cinematic rhetoric. Through the lens of the Adamic Myth, the author examines the film as a metaphoric interpretation or parable of the human condition. Members of the viewing audience are invited to participate in this mythic structure by emulating the actions of the protagonist, thus becoming instruments of sociopolitical change.

</li><li>"Author Abstract: In the late 1980s and 1990s, American popular culture has been increasingly rife with conspiracy narratives of recent historical events. Among cultural producers, filmmaker Oliver Stone hashad a significant impact on popular understanding of American culture in the late twentieht century through a series of docudramas which reread American history through the lens of conspiracy theory and paranoia. This paper examines the films of Oliver Stone - in particular Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July, JFK, and Nixon - asking why they have achieved popularity and brought about catharsis, why they are the subject of attack, and why it is useful to look beyond the debate about truth and falsehood that has surrounded them. It analyzes the ways in which Stone's status as a Vietnam veteran allowed Platoon to be accorded the authenticity of survivor discourse, whereas JFK and Nixon were subject to almost hysterical attack, not only because of Stone's assertions of conspiracy, but also because of his cinematic style of tampering with famous images. Taking these films as its points of departure, this paper examines the role of images in the construction of history, the form of the docudrama, the reenactment of historical images, fantasies of history, and ways in which paranoia is part of the practice of citizenship."

The film fails as an artistic piece but it demands respect for its analysis of the mainstream cinema. The director of the film does not present solutions to the problems of action films but deserves appreciation for his courage to direct a film that boldly depicts the failings of the genre.

Stone is so afraid that his audience will not realize that he is engaged in parody, however, that he restates everything over and over." [Art Abstracts]

In 'The Sky on Location,' director Babette Mangolte focused on landscapes that displayed the loneliness of the West. On the other hand, 'North on Evers' emphasized the interaction between the society and the land. While 'Natural Born Killers' bemoaned the loss of the freedom in the West, 'Roam Sweet Home' accepted not only the West's aging and changes but also their consequences.

</li><li>An overview of the production of Oliver Stone's film Natural Born Killers. Natural Born Killers tracks the bloody exploits of two romantically entangled serial killers across America. Shot by cinematographer Robert Richardson, the film possesses a unique visual style that is a striking example of cinematic experimentation. In crafting the film's garish, eye-popping psychological mindscapes, Stone and Richardson united a broad variety of shooting formats with front- and rear-projection photography, bits of heavy-metal animation, stock footage, and clips from other films. They further enhanced the hallucinatory mix with offbeat lighting schemes; unusual angles; subjective camera techniques; a broken, stream of consciousness editing style; and a daring sound track that juxtaposes wildly diverse musical samples.

</li><li>"A review of Natural Born Killers, a film directed by Oliver Stone. Stone aims at attacking not just movie conventions but also illusionism itself. He presents a film that is deliberately created to look like what it is--a construct, like all other media products.

The problem is that this focus strays in several very incompatible directions." [Art Abstracts]

The film is unafraid to implicate itself in the sadism of spectacle, making its point through punishing, unrelieved harshness and in-your-face excess. A busy collage of visual innovation driven by a compelling industrial/alternative rock soundtrack and laced with ambiguous cheap thrills, it is undoubtedly Stone's piece de resistance and ranks among mainstream cinema's greatest formal experiments. In an interview, Stone discusses such subjects as the relationship between crime, media, society, and the film's style; the questions the film's form raises about the medium of cinema; and the director's doubts about cinema as a medium."

</li><li> The Hollywood claims that Richard Nixon's story is classical and worthy of epic treatment raises the question whether or not Hollywood understands classical literature. Oliver Stone's treatment of the former US president presents the concept that Nixon is the product of his culture. Although Stone avers that the pathological side of American society has produced the likes of Nixon, he absolves him of most of the Watergate guilt by portraying him a victim of circumstances.

</li><li>"Author Abstract: In the late 1980s and 1990s, American popular culture has been increasingly rife with conspiracy narratives of recent historical events. Among cultural producers, filmmaker Oliver Stone hashad a significant impact on popular understanding of American culture in the late twentieht century through a series of docudramas which reread American history through the lens of conspiracy theory and paranoia. This paper examines the films of Oliver Stone - in particular Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July, JFK, and Nixon - asking why they have achieved popularity and brought about catharsis, why they are the subject of attack, and why it is useful to look beyond the debate about truth and falsehood that has surrounded them. It analyzes the ways in which Stone's status as a Vietnam veteran allowed Platoon to be accorded the authenticity of survivor discourse, whereas JFK and Nixon were subject to almost hysterical attack, not only because of Stone's assertions of conspiracy, but also because of his cinematic style of tampering with famous images. Taking these films as its points of departure, this paper examines the role of images in the construction of history, the form of the docudrama, the reenactment of historical images, fantasies of history, and ways in which paranoia is part of the practice of citizenship."

The rhetoric reveals two voices, the veteran as journalist-critic and as "priest." These voices combine to mystify rather than explain the Vietnam experience, resulting in the mystification of knowledge itself. This form of priestly rhetoric, it is argued, serves a hierarchy of power and knowledge that endures as long as the mysteries of Vietnam persevere through periodic invocation by members of a priestly class. In light of past orientations to the cultural priesthood and the social mystery, this veteran's rhetoric is viewed as ironic. COPYRIGHT Southern States Communication Association 1990.

</li><li>"U-Turn represents Oliver Stone's highest aesthetic achievement to date. A purely fictional story adapted from John Ridley's novel Stray Dogs, it is a conscious and much welcome strategic retreat from political controversy. In many ways it reveals what Stone's career could have been had he taken a detour around political disputes. It is a departure for Stone because it is the most humorous picture he has made, and he is working on a much more manageable scale than with previous films. In contrast to his epics, Stone has compressed a long story into conventional feature-length time through the use of images in a visual shorthand. However, it stands little chance of being appraised on its own merits because it is an Oliver Stone film." [Art Abstracts]

</li><li>Despite the attempt to achieve a low-cost movie, Oliver Stone's regular obsessions permeate this film. The film's humor, however, makes a difference; Stone has come up with a raucously joke-filled black comedy. A little-less hysteria on the director's part would have helped the performances.

Shot over six weeks in Superior, Arizona, U-Turn was filmed in 1.85:1 aspect ratio using a Panaflex Platinum camera, complemented by a high-speed Panastar for slow-motion shots and two hand-cranked cameras. Almost 75 percent of the movie was shot on Kodak's 5239 160 ASA color reversal stock, a stock originally developed for research and design purposes." [Art Abstracts]</li>

</li><li>"The production of director Oliver Stone's new film World Trade Center is discussed. This film tells the story of two Port Authority officers rescued from the rubble of the Twin Towers, New York. It was shot by Irish cinematographer Seamus McGarvey, who claims that the production team sought to preserve at least a sense of the notion of truth and the veracity of the image. By and large, the film's style is "spare." McGarvey shot it in Super 35mm-width aperture from a 1.85:1 extraction with a Panaflex Platinum and a Panavised Arri 435, using Primo and Hylen lenses, and Kodak's Vision2 500T 5218, 200T 5217, and Ektachrome 100D 5285 stock. Locations such as the glass-fronted lobby of one of the towers and a concourse beneath the World Trade Center were re-created at Playa Vista, the old Hughes Aircraft Plant in California. The writer goes on to highlight the lighting and/or shooting challenges posed by the major re-created locations." [Art Index]

</li><li>"Part of a special section on the film world's response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. A discussion of Oliver Stone's new film World Trade Center, which is released in cinemas on September 29, 2006. With this film, Stone draws on the real life rescue of two police officers from the rubble of the twin towers of the World Trade Center to create a story of patriotic sacrifice, courage, and faith. What remains questionable, however, is whether it is possible for all viewers to ignore the blood that has subsequently been shed in response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11." [Art Index]

</li><li>"A review of Oliver Stone's World Trade Center (2006). The script for this film is adapted by Andrea Berloff from the testimonies of New York cops John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno and their wives Donna and Alison. In this sense, it has every right to put aside political context and bring us into the human specifics of the day itself. However, Stone's failures are precisely failures of specificity, and despite a whole array of flawless effects shots his staging is not up to the job. In the end, World Trade Center is a drab disaster movie that resorts to the broad, performance led strokes of a Towering Inferno rather than the radically choppy, docudrama urgency of a United 93."

</li><li>"A review of World Trade Center, a film by Oliver Stone. This orthodox film is based on the accounts of two Port Authority policemen who were trapped under the ruins of the World Trade Center during the events of September 11, 2001. Setting the film underground like this avoids having to show images that would satisfy the terrorists, while also providing an allegory of America's isolation from the rest of the world." [Art Index]
