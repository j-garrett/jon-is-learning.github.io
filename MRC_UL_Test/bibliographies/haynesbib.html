<li>"In the chapter on Todd Haynes, Andrews includes a superb reading of the director's banned (allegedly due to uncleared music rights) Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story, a puppet play about politics, social breakdown, and anorexia played by Barbie and Ken dolls. He's equally good on Haynes's rarely screened short satire of America in the 1950s, Dottie Gets Spanked: "Even more unusually, the sexual aspect of the six-year-old's obsession [with a 1950s I Love Lucy type star] is explicit: his fears of being spanked by his father find an echo in his fantasies about spanking and being spanked by Dottie. At the same time, it's characteristic of Haynes that he presents the boy's obsession and fantasies as natural, rather than problematic. When he buries his drawings [of Dottie] in the garden, the impression is not that he is acting out of shame, but that he is beginning to find his voice, standing his ground, storing up his true needs and desires until he is old enough to reveal them to a world that doesn't understand them."

<li>"Director Todd Haynes, best known for his short film Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story and his prizewinning feature Poison, is one of the major proponents of the "New Queer Cinema." Filmed with a cast of Barbie and Ken dolls, Superstar tells the tragic tale of Karen Carpenter's rise to fame and her eventual death from anorexia. Poison is a dramatically and aesthetically complex assemblage of 3 developing stories: a quasi-documentary about patricide, a horror/science-fiction parody, and an elaborate prison homage to Jean Genet. In an interview, Haynes discusses his education, Superstar, Poison, narrative, representation, filmic experimentation, AIDS, and his status as a gay filmmaker." [Art Index]

<li>"Part of a special issue on the work of filmmaker Todd Haynes. The writer discusses the pathos and pathology that are rampant in Haynes's cinema. Pathos saturates Haynes's films, in which it is not so much used as a tactic as it is signified, without cynicism. Moreover, clearly evident across his films is the semiotic slippage among intense affect, suffering, and disease indicated by the etymological affinity of pathos and pathology. While the pathological does not necessarily evoke pathos, both address marginality; for Haynes, this site is either the woman--who becomes the placeholder of the most intense social contradictions, the indicator of the convention's paralysis--or the queer, embodying aberration, exemplary of the impossibility of "being oneself." This focus on the pathological is not just an elaboration of the processes of social marginalization, however, but a challenge to the persistent denial of the inextricability of the sensible and the intelligible."

<li>"Todd Haynes's warmest film, Far from Heaven, closely mimics 1955's All That Heaven Allows, the coldest film by director Douglas Sirk. The Haynes version reproduces the crane shots and slow fades of the Sirk film as well as its Populuxe interiors, its golden-leaved garden belonging to the heroine with two children, and its central tale of a woman plagued by the prejudices of her upscale suburban town and involved in a near-scandalous love affair. In Haynes's version, the romantic object of desire is African-American, and the heroine's husband is homosexual, although battling with it. Throughout, it is these issues that give Haynes's movie a feeling of substance and social reality lacking in the Sirk piece, in which the heroine's difficulty was that her lover was a gardener and that her children and the town were snobs about it. All That Heaven Allows is not a major Sirk movie, and Haynes improves upon it." [Art Index]

<li>"Part of a special issue on the work of filmmaker Todd Haynes. Haynes's 2002 film Far from Heaven demonstrates how media critique can arise with and through media immersion. In its articulation of social issues in and through domestic, romantic, and media entanglements, the film represents a kind of homage to, or reworking of, the melodramas of director Douglas Sirk. Haynes has reworked Sirk's reworking of melodrama's reworking of classical Hollywood film and the social and personal issues it deals with, thereby enacting a complex attitude toward, and position within, mediated culture. This immersion indicates a profound involvement with mass culture, but one that is simultaneously--and precisely because it is so involved--analytical. The writer discusses how film, television, telephony, painting, photography, print, and performance are used as focal points for the film's diegesis even as they also help to focus the film's form and structure."

<li>"Far from Heaven, a film directed by Todd Haynes, gradually, yet consistently, effects a certain displacement of difference. Haynes's film is a drama of marital impasse between Cathy, who engages in a scandalous relationship with her black gardener, Raymond, and her husband, Frank, who struggles with the escalating unmanageability of his homosexual impulses. It transfers and articulates the "invisible" vice of Frank's homosexual desire onto the transgressive scandal of "visible" difference in the interracial couple. While all the sexuality and desire coalesce within the homosexual sphere, the interracial couple is drained of erotics. In the end, the film disappoints its own logic as its structural analogy between racism and homophobia fails due to its very visual organization. It cannot transcend the boundaries it has established for Cathy in terms of racialized geography and spaces, and it cannot grant Raymond the independence it allows Frank, as it has not endowed him with a perspective."

<li>"Todd Haynes's latest movie, Far From Heaven, is a reworking of Douglas Sirk's 1955 picture All That Heaven Allows. In Sirk's movie, an upper-middle-class widow, played by Jane Wyman, falls in love with her gardener, played by Rock Hudson. Shunned by her children and her friends, she ends the relationship only to realize, perhaps too late, that she made the wrong decision. Haynes's film adds the complication of homosexuality to the destabilizing force of interracial intimacy that was also a feature of another remake of the Sirk movie, Rainer Werner Fassbinder's Ali: Fear Eats the Soul (1971). Haynes is worried about how his movie's combination of extreme aestheticism and emotional sincerity will be received. He says he learned from the test screenings that the movie "does exactly the opposite of what audiences want today." [Art Index]

<li>"Part of a special issue on the work of filmmaker Todd Haynes. The writer discusses Haynes's treatment of the abject in his films Poison and Safe. Noting that Haynes's films have maintained a consistent focus on the theme of abjection, she examines two key problematics that each approach the issue of abjection from a different angle: one concerning the performative resources provided by the condition of abjection or rejection by the social order at large, and the other the psychosomatic consequences of a too-forceful repudiation of the abject, or of the constitutive exclusions that are a precondition for the attainment of normative femininity. The writer examine these issues as they appear in Poison and Safe respectively, arguing, among other things, that the relationship between these major problematics does not so much suggest an analogical relation between the condition of femininity and that of male subjectivity "at the margins," but rather delineates their interfaces and the foreclosures on which each is based."

<li>"The writers examine how Todd Haynes' 1995 film Safe implicates the mysterious illness of its protagonist, the upper middle-class white housewife Carol, with the privileges that come to certain subjects, specifically within US empire. They consider what happens to our view of Carol's illness and what it suggests about the social milieu presented in the film when the illness is viewed as an aspect of subjectivity within US empire. Given that Safe is most often discussed as a Queer film, they explore how the critical rubric of Queer cinema in this case needs to be joined with a postcolonial analysis. They then discuss the complex and sometimes contradictory ways in which Carol's illness signifies, not only within a national context of racism and white privilege but within a global order shaped by US hegemony."

<li>"Todd Haynes's motion picture Safe is discussed. Set in 1987, the movie focuses on Carol, an upper-middle-class housewife who lives in a luxury home in the San Fernando Valley in isolation and emptiness. Carol becomes environmentally ill and eventually retreats to what turns out to be a fraudulent recovery camp in the hills of the New Mexico desert, where she ultimately becomes more isolated. Rather than pathologizing Carol, the movie uses her symptoms to comment on discourses that have traditionally pathologized women medically and psychologically; her failure to account for her illness turns her more into the accused than the victim. Although it is brilliant in depicting Carol's world as a sign of the times, the movie is marred in its depiction of the woman as, ultimately, a victim of her own ignorance." [Art Index]

<li>"In "The Epidemiology of Regrettable Kinship: Gender, Epidemic, and Community", in Todd Haynes' [Safe] and Richard Powers' Gain,? the author analyzes two contemporary cultural texts about women and environmentally-linked illnesses to rethink commonplace understandings of the relationship between gender, disease, and community formation. By reading these narratives side by side, Lynch is able to address difficult issues about gendered subjectivity and the fragile construction of collective political identity. While the female protagonists in the texts Lynch examines relate differently to their illnesses, both portray the ways in which women negotiate the potential and limitations of illness communities."

<li>"The distance Todd Haynes puts between the audience and the heroine in Safe is very different to what many commentators have perceived. After its appearance in 1995, critics and film scholars had much to say about the way the film's cinematographic techniques--few close-ups and many long takes--distanced the audience from the predicament of the protagonist as she battles with the increasingly horrifying symptoms of environmental illness, making it difficult, if not virtually impossible, to sympathize with her. A more careful consideration of the film's cinematography reveals, however, that Haynes is trying to draw on the audience's willingness to be fascinated by and to identify with even the most contrived, artificial, or flat characters and environments while denying viewers the privilege of ever understanding them."

<li>"The films of Todd Haynes thrive on contradiction. The 45-minute Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story (1987) uses a cast of dolls to dramatize the life of the pop singer, who succumbed to anorexia at age 32. Due to the intervention of Richard Carpenter and A&M Records, the film has been barred from circulation since 1989. Haynes's feature-length Poison (1990) interweaves three stylistically divergent episodes, each set in a world "dying of panicky fright." The film's subtext is AIDS, but it never actually mentions the disease, and this silent meditation on the climate of crisis and sexual fear prompted by the AIDS epidemic may be Poison's most enduring quality. Haynes's first foray into television, the hourlong Dottie Gets Spanked (1993), utilizes the most conventional of forms--early-Sixties sitcoms--to unearth the sadomasochistic yearnings of a prepubescent boy. His latest film, Safe, is an emotionally devastating examination of "environmental illness."" [Art Index]

It has linear narrative, is shot in 35mm, has a name actress in the lead role, and has the glistening look and sound of films 10 times its $1 million production cost. It is also the most subversive of the director's films, a subtle match of radical form and radical political content. Above all, it is a critique of a passive society in which people ignore the ecological disaster that surrounds them or wait helplessly for someone else to tell them what to do about it. In an interview, Haynes discusses his work, commenting on a range of topics, including his desire to make films about end-of-the-20th-century diseases, his belief that illness is the best thing that happens to the central character in {Safe}, and his desire to frustrate the viewer's narrative expectations.."

<li>"Todd Haynes's Velvet Goldmine traces the history of British homosexual flamboyance from Oscar Wilde to the 70s gender-bending phenomenon of glam rock. Using the rise of glitter rock stars such as David Bowie, Iggy Pop, Brian Ferry, and the New York Dolls as a backdrop, the film focuses on the efforts of reporter Arthur Stuart, played by Christian Bale, to return to his vanished, charmed, glam-obsessed youth, when his teenage sexual identity was expressed by performers Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and Curt Wild (Ewan McGregor), based on Bowie and Pop. Using Citizen Kane's detective-story framing device, Velvet Goldmine sees Stuart investigating the mock assassination of Slade. This allegory of youth's end is a tribute to the giddy transportive power of filmmaking language, a tribute reassembled into a theoretical treatise on gender as a performance and pop culture as transformative."

<li>"Part of a special issue on the work of filmmaker Todd Haynes. The writer discusses the representation of a postmodern relationship to history in contemporary cinema, with particular reference to Haynes's 1998 film Velvet Goldmine. The difficulty of balancing the demands of forgetting and remembering Western history is a postmodern historical predicament that, it is to be hoped, cinema can address, if not resolve. At least some works of contemporary popular culture use an epistemology of trauma and testimony to put the audience in a different relation to history and to help them consider media culture's status in mediating past and present, collective and individual trauma. These works thus aid an understanding of a postmodern aesthetic as mediating among disparate identity groups that would otherwise be at risk of being pitted against each other in a balkanized political landscape. The writer goes on to discuss this phenomenon with particular reference to Velvet Goldmine." [Art Index]

<li>"In Todd Haynes's film Velvet Goldmine, Haynes and cinematographer Maryse Alberti chart the rise and fall of a glam-rock enigma. The film tells the story of the once-legendary glam-rock superstar Brian Slade, as remembered by his ex-wife, manager, and artistic muse in the 1980s, when Slade has faded into obscurity. Aiming to make the film look as if it had been made in the 1970s, the filmmakers drew liberally from the glam-rock aesthetic established by real-life stars such as David Bowie. They also looked at specific films from the 1970s, as well as other sources such as music videos for glam-rock acts. The many 1970s concert scenes are flamboyant in their expressive, deeply saturated colors, whereas the 1980s scenes are quite stark. Zooms were used extensively to create a more voyeuristic visual style." [Art Index]

view of Todd Haynes's movie Velvet Goldmine. The movie focuses on a reporter who sets out to discover what happened to a vanished pop star. The director does a wonderful job of making glam rock fresh, capturing the intensity of the effect it had on its fans, particularly gay kids. It is characterized by great music, funny period recreations, and superb acting, but it falls apart in the second half. Its excess of cultural references eventually makes it suffer from bloat."

<li>"Focusing on Todd Haynes's Velvet Goldmine, the writer discusses the emergence of glam rock in the 1970s. He notes how the period's songs, styles, looks, and sounds of David Bowie, Iggy Pop, Lou Reed, the Dolls, Brian Ferry and Roxy Music, Mar Bolan and T Rex are knowingly redistributed among Haynes's characters. He finds Haynes's film to be a deliriously queer reading of the glam-rock years and a tale of the rise and fall of a composite glam figure drawn from David Bowie as much as anyone." [Art Index]
