</li><li>"Tim Burton's career as a movie director and his works are evaluated. From his directorial debut in the short film 'Frankenweenie' to his latest 'Batman Returns,' Burton's collective work is viewed as trivial often contained in shallow storylines. However, a deeper look reveals a consistency in all his films. Further analysis of characters in Burton films attempts to discover his personality. Other Burton films include: 'Pee-Wee's Big Adventure,' and 'Beetlejuice." [Expanded Academic Index]

</li><li>"Hollywood director Tim Burton's name has been associated with his earlier films such as 'Beetlejuice' and 'Edward Scissorhands,' but Burton became famous with his later films 'Batman' and 'Batman Returns.' His style is evident in his use of the color blue, strong images, fun and cinematic innovation. Burton's work puts these films in a league far ahead of films made on other superheroes such as Superman. There are rumors of a third Batman film, and it is important that Burton directs it, but avoids the mistakes he made in the first two." [Expanded Academic Index]

</li><li>"The writer examines the reception of the illusion created by miniatures in seven films: Fritz Lang's Metropolis, David Butler's Just Imagine, Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, Tim Burton's Batman and Edward Scissorhands, and Alex Proyas's The Crow and Dark City. In each of these films, on which thousands or millions of dollars were spent on elaborate miniature photography, viewers are treated to an aerial vista of a city into which they descend along with the protagonists. While the express ambition of the effects artists is to provide an illusion of a believable city viewed from above, the full pleasure of the film relies on its being seen as a set to be gazed at, beyond anything that either Disneyland or the 1939 World's Fair could offer. Rather than menacing viewers, the filmic miniature permits them to disarm and colonize troubling cultural spaces in what it suggests and omits of America's actual inner-city problems." [Art Index]

</li><li>"Part of a special section on the collaborations between cinematographers, production designers, and directors in the production of several recent feature films. The writer examines the collaborative work behind the 2005 fantasy film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. During production, digital pre-visualization was much more than just a tool to test the cinematic possibilities of the sets for cinematographer Philippe Rousselot. The 3D Maya models created by director Tim Burton, production designer Alex McDowell, and a team of pre-vis artists from Proof, Inc., were also employed to perform many other tasks, from choreographing Oompa Loompas to virtually dressing sets. For Rousselot, pre-vis was especially vital to the process when he was working against greenscreen backdrops and had to light the scene to specifically match the CGI that would be created."

</li><li>"Tim Burton's adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel plays it straighter than the 1971 film version, which resembled a bad trip. Unfortunately, the factory scenes are dulled by the familiarity of Alex McDowell's production design, although the lack of surprises may partly be the fault of Burton, whose style has been so pervasive. The movie is generally on firmer ground outside the factory gates, where the non-factory sets allow it to take flight. Meanwhile, the flashbacks to Wonka's own childhood impressively evoke quiet misery, an important ingredient that tempers the shrillness in the rest of the picture." [Art Index]

</li><li>"A discussion of some of the effects used in Tim Burton's new film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. In creating the Chocolate River practically, special-effects supervisor Joss Williams found Natrusol to be the perfect thickening agent, but had more difficulty finding the right color for the chocolate. Making the river practically allowed visual effects to be used on other aspects of the film, such as the Oompa Loompas who operate the factory. Visual-effects supervisor Nick Davis brought in The Moving Picture Company to create these characters, which involved replicating the one actor who played them all, and scaling them down to the required size."

In each of these films, on which thousands or millions of dollars were spent on elaborate miniature photography, viewers are treated to an aerial vista of a city into which they descend along with the protagonists. While the express ambition of the effects artists is to provide an illusion of a believable city viewed from above, the full pleasure of the film relies on its being seen as a set to be gazed at, beyond anything that either Disneyland or the 1939 World's Fair could offer. Rather than menacing viewers, the filmic miniature permits them to disarm and colonize troubling cultural spaces in what it suggests and omits of America's actual inner-city problems." [Art Index]

</li><li>"Tim Burton's new film, Corpse Bride, which is co-directed by Mike Johnson, showcases the most subtle effects of stop-motion animation through texture and detail, lighting and costuming that exceeds anything achievable by computers, and a satisfying physicality. Its story originates in a Russian folk tale, but the character designs are Burton's, and the film is unmistakably set in a world that is entirely his own. While his film The Nightmare Before Christmas, has become something of a holiday classic, this movie may prove to be a more fragile prospect, given that the two words of its title are among the most unappealing words known to its prospective young audience."

A sardonic science-fiction spoof, the movie is based on a set of 1962 bubblegum cards of the same name. These, along with videodiscs of 1950s science fiction movies, constitute the point of departure of the cinematographic approach; elements from the vintage cards were selected to recreate their spirit, using strong colors as accents. With the Martians created via computer graphics interface, the movie was shot with Panaflex cameras and Primo anamorphic lenses. For the scenes in which the Martians storm through Las Vegas, a specially devised lighting system added effect lighting supposedly created by the aliens' ray gun blasts, with interactive colored lighting used in numerous scenes to create crashing, explosive effects."

</li><li>"Tim Burton's new version of Planet of the Apes is a dream project for Rick Baker, the five-time Oscar-winning makeup artist who is perhaps the nearest thing to a below-the-line celebrity Hollywood can offer. Baker, who received his latest Academy Award last March for Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas, has worked on the majority of the simian-themed movies of the last 25 years, including King Kong, Greystoke, Gorillas in the Mist, and Mighty Joe Young. Burton's film gave Baker the chance to reimagine the advanced, articulate chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans of the 1968 film of Pierre Boulle's novel, which won an Oscar for John Chambers. The writers discuss the work of Baker, costume designer Colleen Atwood, and production designer Rick Heinrichs." [Art Index]

</li><li>"Rick Baker's makeup comprises one half of the illusion-building process needed to put a modern stamp on Tim Burton's remake of "Planet of the Apes." Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) artists contributed the other half of the magic - the backdrop of the film - with their digital, miniature, and compositing work. Baker and artists at ILM discuss how they met Burton's complex demands. Baker's approach had little to do with new materials - he says the foam and latex products used in the film have changed little since the original was made in 1968. Baker individualized hero apes based on characteristics such as species, gender, and size. Since Burton opposed character animation for the lead apes and instead followed the original recipe of makeup on human actors, the film's effects are primarily environmental."

</li><li>"Director Tim Burton's decision to cast "quirky hunk" Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane in his 1999 adaptation of Washington Irving's short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" might at first seem an odd one. Irving's Ichabod Crane is an interloper, a representative not only of thoughtless rapacity but also of creeping urbanization and industrialism, who must be expelled to preserve the idyllic homogeneity of Sleepy Hollow. Depp's Crane is also an interloper, an avatar of the new scientism that threatens this bucolic fairyland, but his seems on the surface to be a much more assimilable kind of alien-ness, largely because of his appearance. By comparison to more traditional renditions of this character, Depp bears all the attributes of regular physical attractiveness. Lying beneath his sexiness is a strain of femininity that simultaneously undercuts and enhances the viewer's reception of him as a masculine presence and as a match for Katrina Van Tassle. This changes the story in a significant way, but also serves to highlight the gender dynamic that lies at the heart of Irving's tale." [International Index to the Peforming Arts]

</li><li>"In the fall of 1999, Tim Burton's "Sleepy Hollow" was released in theaters a few weeks after Halloween. Based on Washington Irving's well-known story of the failed wooing of the local heiress by an awkward schoolmaster, the film recasts the narrative in order to supply the viewer with resolution of the relationship issue while mingling genres. The movie uses elements of horror, mystery thriller, detective film, and fairy tale. The modifications Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay make to the story lead not only toward the exploration of superstition, the supernatural, and the symbolic (linked with the feminine in the picture) in opposition to reason, science, and the written word (linked with the masculine); but also toward the unraveling of patriarchal property rights and female revenge. The women in this rendering of "Sleepy Hollow" run the gamut from the dutiful daughter to the wicked child and the witch woman. Ichabod Crane stands at the intersection of these women and their claims against a patriarchy that destroys itself through conspiracy and vice. The film resolves all these contentious forces through death and the redefinition of the relationship between the sexes." [International Index to the Peforming Arts]

</li><li>"For Tim Burton's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, production designer Rick Heinrichs created Washington Irving's upstate New York town in England. From the beginning, Burton said he wanted to summon up the Hammer Films style, that is, the artifice-heavy look of low-budget horror movies produced by the English studio in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. This desire for a foggy soundstage environment was one of the factors that first drew the production to London. The design of the film combines exteriors of the title village, built on a reserve north of London, and soundstage exteriors constructed at Leavesden and Shepperton Studios." [Art Index]

</li><li>"When comparing Washington Irving's short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" to Tim Burton's film, one may perhaps find only limited resemblance, but the author argues that the movie bears a rather precise relationship to the original tale. The filmmakers have not whimsically moved or arbitrarily desecreated Irving's textual corpus; rather, they have preserved it almost wholly intact, where they found it. By burying it in the midst of a minutely realized spectacle of the supernatural, they have aggressively subjected the story to a diametrically opposed presentation of a world. The picture privileges the sensory text over the written word - the world of objects behind the words moves into the foreground, eclipsing the printed page."

</li><li>"Sleepy Hollow once more demonstrates director Tim Burton's curious ability to rethink anything as an experiment in expressionist autobiography. Although the most striking divergence from the original Washington Irving story is the addition of a genuine supernatural creature, Burton's real rebellion lies in perceiving Ichabod Crane not as an awkward weirdo but as an identification figure. Actor Johnny Depp's Crane is a marginalized hero, given to fainting spells and being squirted in the eye with blood, but a hero nonetheless. The character Brom Van Brunt is the latest in a line of bested bullies that Burton has enjoyed gruesomely killing off, and Christina Ricci's Katrina seems a natural inhabitant of Burton's world. The pleasures of Sleepy Hollow come from high style rather than high camp, and it is never less than ravishing to watch." [Art Index]

</li><li>"This movie version of a Washington Irving story is loaded with pseudo-ghoulish detail and imbued with a distinctive atmosphere but suffers from terminal vagueness and clutter. Its plot is a complicated skein of unrelated fairytale elements and coincidences punctuated occasionally by balletic beheadings. Its characterization, meanwhile, is almost wholly haphazard."

</li><li>"Washington Irving's "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" is a text inextricable from the discourses of colonization, one which apparently critiques but ultimately naturalizes Anglo-American conquest and settlement. While director Tim Burton and screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker in one sense "bury" Irving's text in their film adaptation, "Sleepy Hollow," they also exhume and analyze its ideologically charged corpus. Throughout the course of their revisions, Burton and Walker evoke and amplify Irving's basic elements, but they do so in a way that denaturalizes the colonial discourse of Irving's tale. The narrative syntax of "Sleepy Hollow" elaborates the movie's critique of the detective genre."

</li><li>"Provides an interview with "Sleepy Hollow" film director Tim Burton. States with his keen pictorial instincts and his affection for all things fantastic, Tim Burton is a lightning rod for eccentric, stylized images--which may explain his distinctly unruly coiffure. Comments Burton's latest picture, "Sleepy Hollow," is based on Washington Irving's classic 1819 short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow," but inventively retools the legend of Icahbod Crane and the Headless Horseman. Talks about his creative strategy on the project, as well as his collaboration with director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki, ASC."
