These films, which include 'The Joy Luck Club' and 'Farewell My Concubine,' probably presage the arrival of a new US film market. Increasing trade contacts with Asia, the visibility of Asian Americans and studio marketing account for this burgeoning demand for this genre. A key feature of these films is their depiction of real characters rather than stereotypes.

<li>"Describes the pioneering film industry's depiction of Chinese in China and the United States between 1894 and 1910 and how the industry reinforced earlier negative stereotypes found in American popular culture. The new technology reached a large segment of the public with images of cruel and devious Chinese as violators of white womanhood, unassimilable immigrants with strange ways and values, opium addicts, and objects of ridicule. Fewfilms attempted balanced portrayals of Chinese. From the unflattering coverage of Chinese emissary Li Hung Chang's 1896 visit to the United States to the cruelty of the anti-Christian Boxer soldiers, thenegative imagery prevailed until the 1910's, when Benjamin Brodsky produced a documentary on all parts of China for schools and other educational venues."

(Transnationalism, Media and Asian Americans) ~*OPENBRACKET*~i> Amerasia Journal~*OPENBRACKET*~/i> v22, n3 (Winter, 1996):25 (21 pages).<li>Media reports of a hostage-taking incident in a 'Good Guys' electronics store in Sacramento, California, by Asian youths reveal stereotypes associated with Asian Americans. The media portrayed the four young Asian hostage-takers as unemployed gangsters, aspiring to fame before returning to Thailand. Asian gangs usually committed crimes in their own community, but were now branching out to target other community. Asian communities experienced difficulties in communicating with the police due to the lack of Asian officers in the police departments. The media reports were based on prejudice and misconceptions.

<li>"In contrast to historical representations of women of color as victims and villains, the author argues that the portrayal of contemporary women of color as heroines can be linked to globalization, the economic power of Asian minorities, and prevailing discourses of multicultural-ism. Drawing on the television series Relic Hunter, the author outlines the use of the racialized female hero as a strategic sign to appease social anxieties, resolve contradictions, and manage difference."

~*OPENBRACKET*~i>International Journal of Cultural Studies~*OPENBRACKET*~/i>, vol. 8, no. 2, pp. 151-173, 2005
<D>"This article brings together ethnographic detail and a thematic reading of Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (K3G) to examine the mediation of consensus regarding "Indianness" in the diaspora. The author argues that K3G's emotional resonance with viewers in the diaspora is attributable in part to the departure that its narrative marks from Hindi cinema's earlier efforts to recognize and represent expatriate Indians. In positioning and drawing the diaspora into the fold of a "great Indian family," K3G articulates everyday struggles over being Indian in the United States to a larger project of cultural citizenship that has emerged in relation to India's tentative entry into a transnational economy and the centrality of the nonresident Indian figure to India's navigation of this space. The author argues that this process of mediation follows a transitive logic involving K3G's representational strategies, first-generation Indian immigrants' emotional investment in the idea of India, and the Indian nation-state's attempts to forge symbolic and material ties with the expatriate community."

<li>"Part of a special issue on the representation of Japanese and Chinese women in silent Hollywood movies of the 1920s and 1930s. The writer introduces the topic. The essays in the section, presented as part of the 2004 "Women and the Silent Screen" conference, held in Montreal, Canada, suggest the Asian context as another front for the continuing investigation of gender in the era of silent movies. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the film industries were consolidated in both China and Japan within complex networks of discourses of nationalism, orientalism, and gender; in Europe and North America, meanwhile, Asian women appeared in silent films as key representations of orientalist ideology. The American, European, and Asian films discussed in this special issue show that the figure of the "New Woman" took on a range of personalities and appearances as she moved across cultures and national cinemas. In both the West and the East, cultural otherness became a significant way of articulating new gender norms within the mass media." [Art Index]

<li>"A discussion of British-Asian film. In the UK, the term "Asian" usually describes the ethnicity of peoples originating from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, and British-Asian films for the most part have Asian themes and some common features. While British films with Asian themes have been developing a distinctive identity and hybrid aesthetic with links to different sources, they are arguably most closely related to other "black" films in Britain. These share approaches that have changed over the past 20 years from essentially issue-based work challenging social injustice to more commercially viable features exploring a diverse range of experiences. The writer goes on to examine the history of British-Asian film since the 1980s, the themes and aesthetics of British-Asian films and their parallels with other cinemas, and shifting attitudes in Britain toward Asian cultures."

Mid-19th-century articles and pamphlets warned white America of a Yellow Peril, a horde of Japanese and Chinese who would destroy US civilization, and this led to Asian villains in books and films that persisted through the 1980s.

Actress Anna May Wong fought for good roles and was disappointed by the early film industry, as was Bruce Lee later in the 1970s. Asians were stereotyped and Asian actors took on roles that did not consider their actual ethnicity. More accurate portrayals of Asians and Asian-Americans have been produced in the 1980s and 1990s, including 'The Joy Luck Club' and 'Chan is Missing.'

<li>"Part of a special issue on the representation of Japanese and Chinese women in silent Hollywood movies of the 1920s and 1930s. The writer examines how national and modern gender identities converged in the Japanese "woman's film" (josei eiga) genre in the interwar period. She offers a definition of this genre based on audience composition and the genre's place within the Japanese film industry in the 1920s and 1930s. From this definition, she develops the problem of the critical stance toward cultural discourse at this time by examining Miriam Silverberg's ideas on the identity play of the 1930s as it was often depicted through images of the central trope of these films, the moga or modern girl. She then offers some alternative structures for understanding the apparent changes in Japanese identity in the historical swing between modernity and 1930s nationalism. She presents an analysis of two representative woman's films, Ozu Yasujiro's Woman of Tokyo and Gosho Heinosuke's A Burden of Life, arguing that the moga figure in these films exemplifies how the Japanese woman's film constructed an imagined female subjectivity as a visible reenactment of Japanese anxiety over the interior transformative aspects of modernity."

<li>"The effort to invent and depict an authentic cultural identity for Asian immigrants in the United States involves a battle against a proliferation of false images circulated throughout popular culture. Two feature-length motion pictures, both independently produced under the direction of Wayne Wang, Chan Is Missing (1982) and Dim Sum: A Little Bit of Heart (1985), dramatize the difficulty and complexity faced by Asian immigrants seeking to negotiate a hybrid cultural identity. Both films parody conventional media characterizations of Asian immigrants as a way of critiquing Hollywood's attempts at perceiving and portraying Asian Americans." [America: History and Life]</li>

<li>"The effort to invent and depict an authentic cultural identity for Asian immigrants in the United States involves a battle against a proliferation of false images circulated throughout popular culture. Two feature-length motion pictures, both independently produced under the direction of Wayne Wang, Chan Is Missing (1982) and Dim Sum: A Little Bit of Heart (1985), dramatize the difficulty and complexity faced by Asian immigrants seeking to negotiate a hybrid cultural identity. Both films parody conventional media characterizations of Asian immigrants as a way of critiquing Hollywood's attempts at perceiving and portraying Asian Americans." [America: History and Life]

<li>"Wayne Wang directed the movie 'The Joy Luck Club' based upon Amy Tan's novel, striving to maintain a balance between the comedy and tragedy of the stories. The book and movie cover the lives of four women who immigrated to San Francisco, CA, from China and raised families, with four more stories concerning the lives of their American-born daughters. Each character had a past and present story, making a total of 16 stories to tell." [Expanded Academic Index]

<li>"Amy Tan's "The Joy Luck Club" and the subsequent film based on the novel effectively portray relationships between mothers and daughters, but the works are far less successful at providing insights into Chinese and Chinese-American cultures. To native Chinese, the dialogue in both works seems strained and inconsistent with Chinese speech patterns and phrasing. Despite filming in China and using Chinese actors, the film further departs from accurate representation. Viewers and readers will learn much more from the works of directors Zhang Yimou and Ang Lee." [Expanded Academic Index]

<li>"his article applies theories of diaspora and diasporic consciousness to the study of a film produced in Canada by an independent South Asian film maker, Srinivas Krishna. The film, Masala (1991), a dark comedy filmed in Toronto against a backdrop of South Asian immigrant groups, multi-culturalism and the 1985 Air India bombing and drawing upon the magico-realism of Bollywood productions and Indian devotionals, offers commentaries on questions of identity and life among South Asian diasporic communities in Canada, Canadian social policy, religion and diasporic consciousness. The article examines the way the film is located in diasporic space and how the film maker plays upon the different locations and sensitivities of his audiences to represent, explain and critique diasporic space. The article considers the way caricature and stereotype inform the negotiations of identity among members of diasporic communities, the way objective and subjective spaces are redefined in a diasporic setting and how Hindu beliefs are represented in such settings. The article examines how the film maker draws upon traditional techniques of Indian story telling as well as a mixture of cinematic techniques to tell a diasporic version of a Hindu avatara story. It argues that in simultaneously affirming and challenging the religious beliefs that inform that story, the film maker raises some provocative questions about the vitality of religious and cultural traditions in the diaspora. The article concludes with a brief examination of how the film was received by audiences in India and in Europe and North America." [PsychInfo]

However, the homosexuals depicted in these films are often white, and the Asians are almost always heterosexual.

It is the logical continuation of the interests of this filmmaker, whose previous documentaries share an interest in the legacy of Asian-American women as literal and figurative pioneers, and how art is born from the movement of people across the world.

<li>"Part of a special section on Chinese-American actress Anna May Wong and Orientalism. Wong negotiated issues of celebrity, gender, race, nationality, and power while constructing her career in Great Britain and the United States in the 1930s. Lack of opportunities in Hollywood early in her career led Wong to work in Europe, where she enjoyed great popularity. There, she starred in a number of British films in 1933 and 1934, achieving the visibility out of which her starring roles in Hollywood subsequently developed. She actively cultivated her own narrative as a Chinese-American actress abroad within the context of the developing British and American film industries. As the British industry was seeking to compete internationally with Hollywood, she could more fully and pointedly critique the racism she experienced in the United States while continuing to fascinate British audiences as the embodiment of the Orient."

<li>"Part of a special section on Chinese-American actress Anna May Wong and Orientalism. Representations of the actress in the late 1930s are examined. Focusing on the years prior to World War II, when images of Asian women became more numerous on-screen, the writer examines a number of Hollywood films from the late 1930s in which Wong played the lead female role. He addresses the ways these films fashion Wong's body through the use of costumes that become the fetishistic focus of the camera. He examines how, through Wong's costumes, the repeated image of 1930s China chic worked as a material fantasy that stitched her individual body to a larger social fabric, showing that the garments she wore helped her to construct a vision of a Chinese-American female for her audiences."

"Diane Negra's Off-White Hollywood: American Culture and Ethnic Female Stardom is an intelligent, well-researched contribution to the field of star studies. It investigates female stardom and the way in which the female star's capacity for disruption of patriarchal values is affected by ethnicity. The author refers to the four caryatids on the gateway to Hollywood, statues modeled on Dorothy Dandridge, Mae West, Delores Del Rio, and Anna May Wong as a tribute to multiculturalism but notes that all were homogenized and divested of their individuality and ethnicity. This serves as a perfect symbol of what Negra reveals as the efforts at containment of Hollywood women whose primary attractions and drawbacks for the commercial media are rooted in their association with their ethnicity."

<li>"Part of a special issue on the representation of Japanese and Chinese women in silent Hollywood movies of the 1920s and 1930s. The performative strategy of screen passing developed by pioneering Chinese-American actress Anna May Wong, who was active in Europe and America throughout the 1940s, had a repressed subversive potential. At a time of blatant racism and orientalism, when Asian-Americans hardly had any chance of becoming assimilated into the white mainstream, Asian-American actors were seldom judged by their performing skill, let alone their performative strategy; rather, they were often seen as a mere index of a homogeneous Orient. As a result, Wong's performative strategy of screen passing--her ability to overact in a wide range of racialized roles, which allowed her to bring to the fore the stereotypical and orientalist underpinnings of these roles--has remained unrecognized and occluded by essentialist discourses in both Euro-America and China. The writer goes on to offer a reframing of Wong's screen passing and her "yellow yellowface" performance, elaborating on her ironic intervention and the sociopolitical significance of recognizing it as such."

<li>"This essay examines Anna May Wong's visual and vocal performance of (racial) difference in her late 1930s films and radio play. Drawing upon theories of embodied performance and the actor-acting-role structure, I explore ways of defining difference as gradation (rather than the self-other binary). I argue that Wong's performance of the 'minor' position enables difference from within the dominant matrix, thereby opening up a flexible structure of minority positioning that is also instructive for today's globalscapes."
