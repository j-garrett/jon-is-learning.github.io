</li><li>"This article offers an interpretive, interactional reading of the film The Country Girl (1954). It argues that such texts serve as empirical materials for cultural studies. The beliefs and themes about alcoholism which the film represents are discussed, and it is shown how these are a product of the era in which they were created. Bateson's theory of the double bind is applied to the dyadic and triadic interactions that make up the film's text. Unraveling the double bind in the alcoholic relationship better reveals how this particular form of social relationship destructively perpetuates itself through time. Films like The Country Girl reflect society back to itself, and in so doing contribute to the popular culture's understanding of alcoholism." [Expanded Academic Index]

</li><li>"This study assessed the prevalence of tobacco and alcohol use in top-grossing American films from 1985 to 1995. The top ten money-making films for 1985 to 1995 were viewed to identify the prevalence of alcohol and tobacco use overall and by lead characters. While the use of tobacco and alcohol was stable across the study period, use of these substances was common. Most films (98%) had references that supported tobacco use and 96% had references that supported alcohol use. Discouraging the use of these substances was uncommon. Only one third of films had any references that discouraged the use of tobacco or alcohol (38% and 37%, respectively). At least one lead character used tobacco or alcohol in 46% and 79% of the films, respectively. The hazards of smoking and drinking are not reflected in the behaviors of film characters who are potential role models for youth facing the decision to smoke or drink." [Expanded Academic Index]

</li><li>"American films and television programs increasingly feature characters recovering from addiction. These representations are based on previous depictions and help create a cultural understanding of addicts. This study analyzes the depiction of addicts and addiction in three Hollywood films whose narratives are largely situated within a treatment center: Clean and Sober (1988), When a Man Loves a Woman (1994), and 28 Days (2000). It concludes that the films depict a stock experience of treatment that is surprisingly univocal, as well as unrealistic when compared with the availability and realities of real-life programs. In addition, the films limit their representations of successful recovery to white, upper-class individuals and offer only one conceptual framework for addiction." [Expanded Academic Index]

</li><li>Classic and contemporary motion pictures depicting stories about drugs and alcohol abuse and misuse use the subject as a vehicle with which to revolve the theme or the characters in various ways. Roger Corman's 'The Trip,' Allan Dwan's 'A Star is Born,' Shirley Clark's 'The Connection,' Robert Hamer's 'Pink String and Sealing Wax,' and Fassbinder's 'Veronika Voss' have clearly depicted the real-life travails of drug and alcohol abuse. Stanley Kwan's 'Rouge' and Gus Van Sant's 'Drugstore Cowboy' puts substance abuse under a romantic guise while Chaplin's 'The Cure' plays it lightly.

</li><li>"We examined depictions of alcohol use in 100 popular films spanning 5 decades. Drinkers were depicted as more attractive, more romantically/sexually active, more aggressive, and having a higher socioeconomic status than nondrinkers. No systematic changes were found across decades that might reflect the growing knowledge base regarding the adverse effects of alcohol use. We compared the depiction of alcohol use in movies to real-world demographics and found that alcohol use in movies is somewhat glamorized." [Expanded Academic Index]

</li><li>Throughout the history of cinema, the use of drugs such as opiates and marijuana has been consistently condemned or has passed through distinct phases from opprobrium to celebration. But because of both its image and functionality within the film industry, the framing of cocaine use has been more ambivalent and fluctuating. The period prior to World War II saw cocaine use portrayed both in comic situations and in so-called exploitation films which more closely mirrored sensational press coverage where cocaine was viewed as the 'gateway' drug to opiates. Cocaine largely disappeared from the recreational drugs scene until the late 1960s. Since then, films as diverse as Easy Rider (1969), Annie Hall (1977), Scarface (1983) and Clean and Sober (1988) have framed cocaine use and dealing variously as comic, heroic, glamorous, as well as damaging. This contrasts with crack cocaine in the context of black cinema in the 1980s and 1990s where settings of violence and death predominate. With the cocaine cartels as the focus, Traffic (2000) questions for the first time in a Hollywood movie, the efficacy of the 'war on drugs' while the cocaine trafficking film Blow (2001) returns to a more traditional Hollywood view of vice punished.
