</li><li>"The writers discuss Oscar Micheaux's silent drama Body and Soul (1925) and some of the critical discourses of the period. Micheaux's silent films deflated the pretensions of the growing black middle class in 1920s America by supplying images of victimization and poverty too reminiscent of racist depictions that were supposedly defining characteristics of the race and the essence of the African-American condition. Body and Soul challenged the authority of the minister, an important figure in the community, by raising the topic of Rev. Isaiah T. Jenkins's sexual exploits in a female-dominated congregation. The writers link the film to the politics of identity and the search for racial unity at a time when the class structure within the African-American community was becoming more stratified, showing how the film spoke to different audiences and groups in various ways."

</li><li>"This article examines how pioneer African American filmmaker Oscar Micheaux, in his 1935 film "Murder in Harlem," radically altered the traditional understanding of the 1913 murder of 13 year-old factory worker Mary Phagan and the ensuant trial, conviction, and lynching of factory owner Leo Frank. Not only have the crime and trial remained central to narratives of U.S. social injustice and mob rule, but they have served as a primary marker for antisemitic sentiment and action in American culture. Because Micheaux was the most important African American filmmaker working during this time, and because he was deeply knowledgeable about the interests and expectations of a national African American audience, "Murder in Harlem" gives a unique snapshot of how some in the African American community understood the social and political implications of Phagan murder/ Frank lynching."

</li><li>"Part of a special issue on interiority in films. Oscar Micheaux's 1919 silent feature film Within Our Gates bends the rules of classical Hollywood form. The film's narrative does not flow forward in a linear way, and it mixes such different genre styles as the melodrama, the gangster film, and the Hollywood romance. Micheaux has opened up a codified form to create a space for a new kind of narrative, one that relies heavily on the interiority of the main characters. He challenges dominant accounts of history and race relations by using an unusual filmic approach to single shots and to larger narrative construction. The writer briefly outlines the key qualities of the single shot in the film and then analyzes the film's narrative form in greater detail." [Art Abstracts]

Between 1918 and 1948, he wrote, produced, directed, edited, publicized, and distributed as many as 48 silent and sound underground films for the African-Americans who patronized ghetto theaters. The films' themes of interracial love, wrongful accusation, and racial prejudice were obsessively repeated and echoed events in Micheaux's life. Most of Micheaux's films offer plenty of singing and dancing, and he also translated standard Western, gangster, and melodrama fare into a black context. His work was condemned by both black and white critics for its lack of craftsmanship and competence, but it foreshadowed subsequent avant-garde technique. Micheaux's love-hate relationship with his race is expressed in all his work. For every film that focused on the vices of drugs, alcohol, and gambling, there was another celebrating black achievement." [Art Abstracts]

</li><li>The article presents a response to the article ~*OPENBRACKET*~a href="#grupenhoff">"The Rediscovery of Oscar Micheaux," by Richard Grupenhoff~*OPENBRACKET*~/a> published in the "Journal of Film and Video." According to the authors, Grupenhoff's writing serves as a good acknowledgment to Micheaux as an African American filmmaker who has received a lifetime achievement award from the Directors Guild of America. However, the authors claim that one interpretative paragraph in Grupenhoff's write up regarding film critics, particularly black, needs serious qualification. In contrast to Grupenhoff's saying, they assert that Micheaux was criticized throughout his career by the black press such as the Young Communist League and the National Negro Congress.

</li><li>"One of the most serious objections to the work of Oscar Micheaux relates to his use of negative racial caricatures, but Micheaux's historical situation has seldom been taken into consideration by those leveling that charge. Micheaux is the most prolific African-American filmmaker ever, producing seven novels and about 40 African-American films, all for black audiences, from 1913 to 1948. He developed his early work during some of the worst setbacks for African-Americans and at a time when black people were played by whites in blackface, as was the case in D. W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation. Caricature was seen by Micheaux as a prime obstacle to African-American advancement, and its abolition was an early rhetorical objective necessary to his goal. In working toward this end, Micheaux presented caricature for the purpose of criticizing it, the purest example of which was his minstrel caricature in TheDarktown Revue." [from ArtAbstracts]

Micheaux's importance in the cultural life of blacks haslong been neglected, but by the early 1990s scholars have started researchon his life and work and so far three books have been published on the filmmaker.

</li><li>"Prolific black filmmaker Oscar Micheaux (1884-1951) was a unique and compelling figure. His 1925 film Body and Soul articulates a sustained racial politics through its evocation and critique of several plays by white authors about "the Negro soul," including All God's Chillun Got Wings, by Eugene O'Neill. Micheaux was one of America's top producers of silent race films between two world wars. His films were intended for black audiences in a racially segregated society. With around 37 movies credited to him, he occupies the position as the most prolific African-American moviemaker to date. Although only three of his 22 silent movies survive, these identify him as one of the most original and important filmmakers of the silent period." [Art Index]

He was born in Metropolis, Illinois on January 2, 1884. He wrote melodramatic novels and formed his own film company. He toured the nation with scripts, persuading theater managers to give him an advance against future bookings. He thus had capital and show dates before production. Given the limitations of finances, studio connections, inadequacy of equipment, distribution, and racial climate, Micheaux's initiative, aggressiveness, and success helped open doors for future black actors, screenwriters, and directors."

</li><li> "Oscar Micheaux, an African-American writer and filmmaker who has emerged as one of the prolific African-American filmmakers in cinema history, promoted and linked several of his films to the court case known as the Rhinelander case. Kip Rhinelander was a wealthy white millionaire who married an African-American woman, Alice Jones, in the mid-1920's. The trial overturned the forced annulment and validated the marriage, despite the racial and sexual politics that dominated the discourse of this period. The author explores sensationalizing of the Rhinelander case by the African-American press and Micheaux's strategic exploitation of the media attention, linking it with his films, employing marketing and promotional strategies to generate appeal for his works among African-American cinema audiences."

life of Afro-Americans during their time. Micheaux's works gave valuable insights on utilizing available resources and achieving success despite obstacles." [Expanded Academic Index]

</li><li>"In 1922, the Virginia General Assembly authorized the creation of a Board of Censors and charged it with reviewing all films submitted for public viewing. While the guidelines given the board did not explicitly address racial issues, Virginia's censors prohibited film portrayals of intimate or friendly interracial contact, negative representations of whites, and threats to the social order, including anything showing the potential for interracial violence. Virginia wanted to preserve the illusion of racial amity, but the only way to do that and preserve "racial integrity" was to whitewash race relations. The motion pictures of black filmmaker Oscar Micheaux, including Birthright (1924), A Son of Satan (1924), The House Behind the Cedars (1924), and Veiled Aristocrats (1932), directly addressed the daily reality of black experience. His nuanced images of blacks were perceived to be a threat to white supremacy in Virginia and, for that reason, his films were heavily censored if not banned outright." [America History and Life]
