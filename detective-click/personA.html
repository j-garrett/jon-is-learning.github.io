        <p>	I see you're hear to look into the death of Mrs. Applebottom. I tell you I'll miss her. We didn't always see eye to eye, but not everyone can. It wasn't like her wanting roses in every damn planter was unfair. She was paying me after all. I just hate working on roses. I don't have the dexterity for it. I'll sure miss her, but now whenever I see a rose I can remember her and keep her memory alive.</p>
