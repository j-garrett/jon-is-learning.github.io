        <p>"You've caught us. There's no use denying it any longer. We've kept this affair secret for years."</p>
	<p>"At first it was simple. We kept each other company in the long summers when I was home from school. Since then, it has grown into something mature and powerful. I would have liked to tell mother before she passed, but I was afraid she wouldn't approve."</p>
	<p>You are unwilling to listen further,
		"I'm sorry I busted in on ya. <a href="3staircase.html">I'll be going now</a>, but I'd like to say one thing before I do. Uf you were afraid she wouldn't approve of your tryst them maybe you were so afraid of her reaction you had to make sure she never knew of it. You made sure she never knew, all right, by murdering her! I'll give you a chance to come quietly on your own, but if you don't do it soon, I'll do it for ya."</p>
