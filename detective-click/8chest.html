<p>You open the chest and find a photo album. It seems to be a hope chest. Why stop here? You pick up the album and flip to the first page:</p>

<div id="truelove">
	<img src="images/album1.jpg"/>
		<p>This was from the first night we stayed together.</p>
</div>


<div id="truelove">
	<img src="images/album2.jpg"/>
		<p>I always loved that he made me feel beautiful.</p>
</div>


<div id="truelove">
	<img src="images/album3.jpg"/>
		<p>This is from the well on our property.I had fallen down it and he searched all day to find me. I told him to get me out of there, but he refused to do anything until he snapped this picture of me. He said I looked fragile and reminded him of a rose.</p>
</div>


<div id="truelove">
	<img src="images/album4.jpg"/>
		<p>I got so angry for him taking this photo of me bathing. He put the camera down and apologized. It's a reminder of forgiveness and acceptance to me.</p>
</div>


<div id="truelove">
	<img src="images/album5.jpg"/>
		<p>Kiss cam. What more can I write?</p>
</div>

<div id="truelove">
	<img src="images/album6.jpg"/>
		<p>He always makes the most beautiful flower arrangements.</p>
</div>

<div id="truelove">
	<img src="images/album7.jpg"/>
		<p>I made him show me how to use his camera so I could have some photos of him.</p>
</div>

<div id="truelove">
	<img src="images/album8.jpg"/>
		<p>Finally figured out the timer setting and got this wonderful picture of us. I hope this album can start having more pictures of him now that I'm learning how to use his camera.</p>
