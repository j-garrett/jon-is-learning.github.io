<dd>Directed by Wim Wenders. Cast: Frederic Forrest, Peter Boyle,
Marilu Henner, Roy Kinnear, Lydia Lei. "Based in part on
detective-fiction writer Dashiell Hammett's early experiences as a
Pinkerton detective, this moderately-noir film has Hammett (using
his little-known first name, Sam) involved in an elaborate
extortion plot by his former detective agency mentor, Jimmy Ryan.
Ryan shows up at Hammett's San Francisco digs searching for a
mysterious Chinese girl, Crystal Ling. He calls in a marker from
Hammett's days at the detective agency to get his help in finding
the girl, who turns out to be a very sexy and shrewd former
prostitute and porn star. She has photographs of San Francisco's
most influential citizens engaged in sexual fantasy with her and
she means to turn them into a million-dollar payday. The tubercular
Hammett must cope with an unfriendly police force, a mysterious
gunsel intent on inflicting serious harm, and betrayal by supposed
friends; to save the reputations of the powerful while tweaking
their collective noses." [<a href=

California, a rancher found a naked, unconscious Indian, near

back to health, it was eventually discovered that the Indian, named
Ishi, was the last surviving member of a small tribe called the
Yahi, which had been decimated by disease, starvation and clashes
with other tribes high in the mountains, and was so reclusive that
none of the area's white residents, and few of its Indians, knew of
their existence or had ever even heard of them. Ishi was studied
and eventually befriended by UC Berkeley anthropologist Theodore
Kroeber who wrote a book about him, upon which this film was based.

menacing companion of Zorin, whilst dragging Stacy Sutton along for
the ride. Based on the novel by Ian Fleming. 50 min. <b>vhs
