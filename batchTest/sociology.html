<dt><b>People Like Us</b></dt>
<dd>How do income, family background, education, attitudes,
aspirations, and even appearance mark someone as a member of a
particular social class? Discusses how social class plays a role in

gated communities. Travels across the U.S. to present stories of
family traditions, class mobility, and different lifestyle choices.
Contents: Part 1. The choices you make reveal your class (Joe
Queenan's balsamic vinegar tour ; The trouble with tofu ; How to
marry the rich) -- Part 2. A tour through the landscape of class
(WASP lessons ; Bourgeois blues ; Tammy's story) -- Part 3. Blue

<dt><b>Philosophy, the Social Context</b></dt>
<dd>London School of Economics professor Ernest Gellner discusses
contemporary philosophy, its historical and social backgrounds, and
its role in modern society. Gellner examines the radical expansion
of scientific knowledge and its dehumanizing effect on society as
expressed by sociologist Max Weber. Marxism's messianic expectation
is blamed for its failure to reconstruct society. Gellner dismisses
today's philosophy of relativism as unworkable. 1977. 46 min.

<dt><b>Punishment</b></dt>
<dd>A documentary exploring the social phenomenon of punishment.
The forms of punishment that a society chooses, and what it deems a
crime, illustrate that society's values. How is justice pursued and
punishment meted out? Looks at the history of punishment, beginning
with early compensatory forms of justice, Hammurabi's Code and the
Law of Moses. Socrates' execution and Roman and medieval forms of
justice are analyzed in a historical context, underscoring the fact
that punishment was often intended as a deterrent rather than as a
reformatory measure. Discusses contemporary forms of punishment,
including the death penalty, along with the ways in which these
sentences reflect what society values. 2003. 53 min. DVD 5039</dd>

<dt><b>Social Class in America</b></dt>
<dd>Are social classes pre-determined? This vintage film aims to
examine this question during an era when many citizens of various
races and social classes were still not extended complete civil
rights. This 1957 documentary follows three boys from three
different social classes in the United States. It is a fascinating
look at the history of socioeconomic determinism in the U.S. that
tries to push the idea that social classes in America are
determined before people are born, despite what we like to believe.

<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10" border="0"><b>Connections.</b> What is sociology?
In this introductory lesson various perspectives are offered by
leading sociologists for understanding the complex interplay of
individuals, groups, and relationships in society, and how they
provide a context for living and a roadmap for understanding life's
limitations ... and possibilities. Students Rising Above, a program
that helps disadvantaged youth succeed in school, is featured in
this episode. DVD 4796</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10" border="0"><b>Truth be Told.</b> Sociological
research and methodology is often the subject of debate among
sociologists. The pursuit of objectivity in sociological research,
critical sociology, and the idea of sociology as a science ... each
has transformed the way sociologists approach sociological
research. This lesson also includes discussion of quantitative and
qualitative methodologies, and features a segment on sociologist
Mitchell Duneier and his research on New York City homeless
populations. DVD 4797</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10" border="0"><b>Common Ground.</b> Values, beliefs,
traditions, language and material goods form the subject of this
lesson about the components of culture. Opens and closes with a
look at the Amish -- a group whose members in Southeastern
Pennsylvania maintain language and other cultural traditions unique
to early Germanic settlers to the region. The American values of
individual rights and consumerism are also discussed. DVD 4798</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10" border="0"><b>Fitting In.</b> Humans are born
without any culture. For virtually anyone the process of
socialization begins with the family and continues through other
social agents such as school, peer goups and mass media. The
popularity of reality television shows that offer "extreme
makeovers" [of persons] is highlighted in this lesson as an example
of the desire to fit in. DVD 4799</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10" border="0"><b>Face to Face.</b>This lesson looks
at how such aspects of social interaction as language, humor and
emotion can shape and change the way we view the world around us.
Nowhere is this interaction more visible than in the fusion of
language and emotion which characterize the world of politics. But
social interaction in the more mundane world of everyday life can
be just as significant. This lesson begins with a stand-up comedy
show that helps us further understand the significance of humor, as
both a form of self-expression and as a culturally specific method
of social interaction. DVD 4800</dd>

<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10" border="0"><b>All Together.</b> Whether a small
group or a multinational corporation, every organizaton has its own
culture. This lesson looks at organizational behavior and includes
discussion around the ideas of Frederick Taylor and "scientific
management," corporate culture and the pitfalls of bureaucracy. As
we see in the Outward Bound program, every organization has its own
unique culture that is likened to the values and norms of the wider
society. DVD 4801</dd>

behavior? Programs like Delancey Street Foundation operate "outside
the norm" by assisting convicted criminals to become productive
members of mainstream society. Differing views on sexuality and
violent crime are explored in the lesson, as are some of the moral,
religious and psychological factors that play a role in
understanding deviant behavior. DVD 4802</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10" border="0"><b>Matters of the Flesh.</b>
Conflicting views about sexuality permeate American culture. These
conflicts play out in a variety of ways, from how we perceive
sexually explicit materials to how we legislate on the issue of
abortion. This lesson looks at the concept of sexuality and
explores different attitudes towards sexuality education, abortion
and sexual orientation. We meet Renee Walker (BACHE), a concerned
mother who objected to the sexuality education program (CryBabies)
at her son's middle school because she believed the program was
biased. DVD 4803</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10" border="0"><b>Ups and Downs.</b> Since the 1950s
when opportunity reached its peak, the gap between the "haves and
have nots" has grown. This lesson looks at social stratification
and the dimensions of social inequality that exist in the United
States, as seen in the story of an immigrant from Eastern Europe
who, along with her family, comes to the U.S. with virtually
nothing, and eventually manages to open and operate a successful
child care business. DVD 4804</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10" border="0"><b>Worlds Apart.</b> Why can one
continent be relatively affluent and another mired in poverty? This
lesson looks at stratification on a global scale and introduces the
ideas of globalization and neo-liberalism. The lesson features
Doctors Without Borders -- an organization whose stated aim is to
serve populations in need anywhere in the world irrespective of
religious, political or social barriers that may exist. DVD
4805</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10" border="0"><b>Venus and Mars.</b> Are men and
women really that different? Society tends to emphasize differences
more than similarities. This often leads to competition, and in
some cases, inequality. Gender issues and stratification, the
gender divide in the workplace, the impact of Title Seven, and the
women's movement are explored in this lesson. As illustrated in the
example of a female football team, it can take a lot of
determination to defy the agents of socialization and overcome
gender basis. DVD 4806</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10" border="0"><b>Colors.</b> For racial and ethnic
minorities, the struggle for recognition and equality is nothing
new. Perhaps nowhere is this more visible than in the United
States. The polarizing effects of stereotyping, racial prejudice
and discrimination, and its impact on generations of Black
Americans are discussed. Learners will also meet the Bazzy family -
an Arab-American family in Michigan who must cope with local
misconceptions and generalizations about Arab culture in the wake
of 9/11. DVD 4807</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10" border="0"><b>Golden Years.</b> The longevity
revolution, cross-cultural differences, stereotypes -- all present
challenges to meeting the needs of America's growing population of
elderly adults. This lesson explores issues surrounding aging,
death and dying, and features the Jewish Home for the Aged in San
Francisco -- a nursing home that provides a rich array of programs
for it residents. DVD 4808</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10" border="0"><b>Working World.</b> Today we live in
a rapidly changing economic and social climate that emphasizes the
bottom line. What is the impact on society? What role does
globalization play? The situtation faced by striking grocery
workers illustrates some of the frustrations experienced by
employees in today's changing global economy. This lesson also
includes a discussion around the impact one retail giant in
particular is having on workers, the economy, and the world --
Walmart. DVD 4809</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10" border="0"><b>Balance of Power.</b> Too often
government only hears from insiders with access to money and
education, which is why grass roots movements in the form of local
and statewide initiatives often represent the best way for the
average person to make his or her voice heard. This episode looks
at the sociology of politics as illustrated in the California
ballot initiatives Proposition 68, to expand legalized gambling [on
Indian lands], and Proposition 71, for the support of stem cell
research. DVD 4810</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10" border="0"><b>Family Matters.</b> The traditional
or nuclear family of the 1950s and 1960s is what most of us think
of when asked to define "family." But the idea that there is a
typical family is perhaps little more than a myth. This lesson
considers the diversity of family forms that exist today and
cultural shifts that are changing the definition of "family." You
will meet the Scott-Chung family and a lesbian couple who discuss
their decision to start a family. DVD 4811</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10" border="0"><b>In God We Trust.</b> Most religions
define themselves by their respective rituals and traditions. What
is remarkably consistent, however, is the role that virtually all
religions play in the lives of their followers. Religion in the
United States, its effect on the tapestry of American society, and
its delicate relationship with politics are the focus of this
lesson -- which also features a look at Catholicism and Voodoo in
New Orleans. DVD 4812</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10" border="0"><b>Learning Curves.</b> The type of
education a child can expect to receive may have less to do with
the teacher but more to do with socioeconomic status, race and
culture. These and other factors make the question of how best to
educate American children a complicated one. In this episode you
will meet two families who have chosen different approaches to
educating their children. The growth in home schooling as an
alternative to conventional education is explored. DVD 4813</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10" border="0"><b>Taking the Pulse.</b>Health care in
the United States has reached a crisis point, despite advances in
medicine and technology. Yet this is not necessarily the case in
other parts of the world. This lesson looks at health and society,
and explores such issues as inequities in health care coverage, the
economics of providing care, alternative medical treatments and
ethical questions including right-to-die. Particular emphasis is
placed on one of the most serious sexually transmitted diseases --
HIV/AIDS. DVD 4814</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10" border="0"><b>Rise and Fall.</b> This lesson
reviews population, urbanization and the environment from a
sociological point of view. While each of these is often analyzed
separately, it is the dynamic, constantly shifting interplay among
all three that is perhaps most significant. Topics covered include
fertility, mortality, migration, population growth, global climate
change, and sustainability." As a case study looks at positive and
negative effects of the building boom in Fresno, California. DVD
4815</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10" border="0"><b>Mass Appeal.</b> Social movements
are not a new phenomenon. Fundamental to all social movements, past
and present, is the idea of collective identity. But other factors
that are at play often determine whether a social movement will be
a success or failure." Looks at the women's movement, civil rights
and the gay rights movements as examples of American social change
through united social action and also at the recent ANSWER
Coalition (Act Now To Stop War and End Racism). DVD 4816</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10" border="0"><b>Waves of Change.</b>What is social
change and what are its causes?" This final lesson of the series
provides a deeper understanding of both the concepts and the
consequences at the heart of social change. As a case study this
segment documents how the Winnemen Wintu, a Native American tribe
in the Shasta-Trinity Area of Northern California, have been
negatively impacted by U.S. Government water and land policies. DVD
