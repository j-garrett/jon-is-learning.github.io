Elisabeth Trissenaar, Wojciech Pszoniak, Gerd Baltus, Anita Hofer,

camps. Set in Silesia during WWII, the drama unfolds with the
concealment of the woman by the wealthy, sexually repressed farmer,
and moves through various stages of power and powerlessness on both

<dt><b>A Bite to Eat</b> (Czechoslovakia, 1963)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Jan Nemec. Nemec's diploma film from the Prague
Film Academy. The film is a hallucinatory moment, virtually without
dialogue and handles one man's feverish attempt to steal a loaf of
bread from a Nazi-guarded train. 10 min. In Czech with German
subtitles. <b>vhs 999:3795</b></dd>

<dt><b>Het bittere kruid (Bitter Sweet)</b> (Netherlands,
1985)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Kees Van Oostrum. Cast: Ester Spitz, Gerard
Thoolen, Kitty Courbois, Frank Rigter. This interpretation of the
life of a Jewish girl in Holland -- who escapes being sent to
German death camps in 1942 while the rest of her family is deported
-- is loosely based on the autobiographical novel by Marga Minco.
The author sued to insert a disclaimer before the title that a
fictional Nazi family introduced in this film and the young Jewish
girl could never have had the relationship shown, a relationship
contrary to her book and her experience. Screenwriter Maurice Noel
added the Nazi family whose father is a VIP in the Nazi youth,
whose son is a Nazi soldier, and whose daughter makes friends with
the Jewish Sara while the two are in the hospital. Later, viewers
are to believe that Sara visits the Nazi family often and is
welcomed -- wearing her yellow star -- in complete safety. The real
"Sara" was hidden for three years by friends in the Dutch
Resistance and miraculously escaped deportation and death only
because of their own risk in hiding her. <b>In Dutch without

Rachel, a young Jewish girl hiding from the Nazi's during World War
II in The Netherlands, sees her hiding place blown up. She escapes
with her rescuer, a young sailor, but the boat sails into a trap
set by the Germans. She escapes and joins the resistance, and under
the false name Ellis de Vries she meets SS-hauptsturmfuhrer Ludwig
Muntze on a train smuggling weapons. She goes to his headquarters
to meet him again and gain his trust, and soon they fall in love.
She joins his office as a spy, but when someone within the
resistance betrays her, she is now seen as an enemy betraying both
sides. All that's left to do is run with the man she learned to
love and find a way to prove her innocence by finding the real
betrayer. 146 min. <b>DVD 8526</b></dd>

conference, but under this thin veneer of manners lay an evil
intent. By the end of the meeting, the fate of six million lives
would be decided and the shape of the world would be altered

<dt><b>Council of the Gods (Der Rat der G&ouml;tter)</b> (East
Germany, 1950)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Kurt Maetzig. Cast: Paul Bildt, Fritz Tillmann,
Willi A. Kleinau, Hans-Georg Rudolph, Albert Garbe, Helmuth
Hinzelmann, Inge Keller, Yvonne Merin, Kate Scharf. A film based on
the Nuremberg Trials against the directors of the IG Farben Company
which proved the joint guilt of German industry in fascism and war,
and the close ties between big industry and the Nazis. Two main
protagonists dominate this epic. Chairman Mauch, who had supported
Hitler, finds new fame and fortune in West Germany after the war,
while the bourgeois chemist Dr. Hans Scholz lives through a
tortutous political transformation forced to face the fact that
poison was being produced in his factory which was used to kill
millions at concentration camps. The film also brings to light the
cooperation between German industry and U.S. monopolies. In scenes
that take place after 1945, the USA is portrayed as a latent
fascist power. Special DVD features: Interviews; newsreels; about
the filmmakers; stills gallery; 3 vintage trailers. Based on IG
Farben by Richard Sasuly. 105 min. <b>DVD 6869; vhs

<dt><b>Defiance</b> (2008)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Edward Zwick. Cast: Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber,
Jamie Bell, Alexa Davalos, Allan Corduner, Mark Feuerstein. Based
on true events. The deep forests of Poland and Belorussia are the
domain of the occupying Germans during World War II. The three
Bielski brothers go into the forests to undertake the impossible
task of foraging for food, weapons and survival, not just for
themselves but for a large mass of Polish Jews fleeing from the
German war machine. The brothers, living with the fear of
discovery, must contend with neighboring Soviet partisans and
deciding whom to trust. They take on the responsibility of
guardians and motivate hundreds of women, men, children and elderly
to join their fight against the Nazi regime while hiding in
makeshift homes in the dark, cold, unforgiving forest. At the same
time, the brothers turn a band of war defectors into powerful
freedom fighters. Based on the book "Defiance: the Bielski
Partisans" by Nechama Tec. Special features: Commentary by director
Edward Zwick, return to the forest: The making of Defiance,
Children of the Otriad: The families speak, and more. 136 min.

is forbidden to practice medicine in Prague during the Nazi

ever fearful of informant neighbors and vigilant authorities.

thinly-disguised allegory about contemporary communist
Czechoslovakia that is rich in atmosphere and dark in tone. 100

<dd>This documentary examines how American filmmakers reacted to
German scapegoating of Jews before, during, and after the war,
ranging from the boldness of Confessions of a Nazi Spy and The

the war) to more oblique statements during the war itself, and then
finally leading to an honest portrayal of the full consequences of
the Holocaust beginning in the '50s. This film interweaves clips
from Holocaust movies and interviews with film producers and
directors and survivors who work in the film industry. 2004. 90

Israel Becker, Bettina Moissi, Bertha Litwina, Jacob Fischer, Otto
Wernicke, Paul Dahlke, Alex Bardini, David Hart, Mischa Nathan,
H.L. Fischer. A forgotten classic and a film of passionate
restraint, made by and about Jewish Displaced Persons. Produced in
the American zone of occupied Germany in the aftermath of World War
II, this first feature film to represent the Holocaust from a
Jewish point of view has the power of a collective self-portrait.
The young hero is deported in the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto,
jumps an Auschwitz-bound transport to take his chances in the
countryside, and ultimately survives the war with a band of Jewish
partisans to search for his family in the ruins of liberated
Poland. 77 min. <b>DVD X2483; vhs 999:3757</b></dd>

<dt><b>Taking Sides</b> (France / UK / Germany / Austria,

Stellan Skarsgard, Moritz Bleibtreu, Birgit Minichmayr, Ulrich
Tukur, Hans Zischler, Armin Rohde, Augush Zirner, Thomas Thieme.
After Hitler took over power in 1933, many Jewish artists were
forced to leave Germany. Based on true events this is the story of
Wilhelm Furtwangler who choose to stay. Though never a member of
the party, he was a receipient of honors associated with party
membership. However, the conductor often used his position and
contacts to save hundreds of Jewish musicians from concentration
camps. When U.S. Major Steve Arnold is tasked with the pre-trial
investigations, his aim is to prove that the conductor's genius
contributed to the Nazi propaganda, while Furtwangler insisted he
stayed to bring comfort to the German people with his music. Based
upon the play by Ronald Harwood. 105 min. <b>DVD 5328; vhs

<dt><b>Jud S&uuml;&szlig;</b> (Germany, 1940)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Veit Harlan. Cast: Ferdinand Marian, Werner Krauss,
Henrich George, Kristina S&ouml;derbaum. Produced in 1938, but not
released until 1940, "Jud Suss" was the film that made the wearing
of the Jewish Star of David in Europe mandatory. This is the Nazi
version of the novel of the same title by Lion Feuchtwanger. It is
based on the real historical character of Josef Suss Oppenheimer
who was tax advisor to Karl Alexander during the early 1700's and
was publicly executed in Stuttgart for manipulation of state funds.
In 1926 Feuchtwanger (also Jewish) wrote the novel "Jud Suss" which
contained no anti-Semitic content whatsoever. In 1934 British
Gaumat Studios produced the film under the title "Power". Minister
of Nazi Propaganda Joseph Goebbels saw the film and felt that the
film could be produced in a Nazi version to benefit National
Socialism. 95 min. <b>DVD X1808; also DVD 3856; vhs

<dt><b>The Rothschilds' Shares in Waterloo (Die Rothschilds Aktien
auf Waterloo)</b> ; (Germany, 1940)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Erich Waschneck. Cast: Carl Kuhlmann, Hilde
Weissner, Gisela Uhler, Erich Ponto. The Rothschilds was the first
of three stridently antisemitic movies made in 1940 under the Nazi
regime. A purportedly "historical" account of the Rothschild
family's rise to fortune, set mostly in Great Britain during the
Napoleonic wars, the movie reflected a wildly ambitious
racial-political agenda. Yet the film's dramatic conventions did
not always mesh with its racial politics, and when the film was
released in July 1940, German audiences were left unclear as to
just who they were mainly supposed to hate. Goebbels had it pulled
from distribution; a year later, a much-revised version, purged of
any conceivable sympathies for its British characters, was
released. The revamped movie was renamed The Rothschilds: Shares in
Waterloo; this is the version presented here. But by the time of
its re-release, the movie's moment had passed. A new, wildly
popular film, <a href="#suss">Jud S&uuml;&szlig;</a>, had become
the regime's preferred vehicle for whipping up antisemitic feeling.
If, in the end, The Rothschilds proved a less effective incitement
to hate, it wasn't for lack of trying with its striking
juxtaposition of Nazi social criticism and racial theory, its twin
assaults upon Jewish and British character, and its deft recycling
of many key myths surrounding the House of Rothschild. 97 min.

<dt><b>Cohen on the Telephone</b> (1929)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Robert Ross. Cast: George Sidney. With the advent
of sound, the vaudeville-immigrant genre added comic speech to its
repertoire of physical comedy and funny situations. This film
presents a humorous monologue of a Jewish immigrant using the
telephone for the first time when he calls his landlord about
repairs to the owner's property. Unfamiliar with the telephone and
still uncomfortable with the English language, Cohen embroils
himself in a comic monologue of misunderstanding. 9 min. <b>DVD

<dd>Directed by Mack Sennett. Cast: Ford Sterling, Mabel Normand,
Henry Lehrman. "'Cohen Saves the Flag' is a very early Keystone
comedy, one of several starring Ford Sterling as a scruffy coward
named Izzy Cohen. All of the instalments in the 'Cohen' series
feature some humour based on Jewish stereotypes, which has dated
badly; fortunately, these films also have clever storylines and
non-ethnic slapstick gags, so (with the possible exception of
'Cohen Collects a Debt') these films are still funny in spite of
some (arguably) anti-Semitic content. All of the other 'Cohen'
shorts are set in the contemporary present; 'Cohen Saves the Flag'
backdates Izzy Cohen to 1861 in order to put him in a Civil War
setting." [from <a href=

Hollywood apparently found it more palatable to deal with
anti-semitism than homophobia). Based on Richard Brook's novel,

T.J. Moses forge a friendship based on a mutual love of rap music
and dance. Two groups that have suffered persecution throughout the

invites a group of filmmakers to shoot two versions of the
Andalusian musical drama "The girl of your dreams" in Berlin. Happy
to leave the war behind them, the troupe of Spaniards starts
filming in Hitler's Berlin. The hospitality upon their arrival has
more to do with the youthful charms of Macarena Granada. What's
more, the only Andalusion-looking extras in Germany are the gypsies
and Jewish prisoners in a nearby concentration camp. When Macarena
befriends one of the prisoners, the troupe must decide if the movie
is more important than their lives. 105 min. <b>DVD 8148</b></dd>

<dt><b>The House I Live In</b> (1945)</dt>
<dd>Directed Mervyn LeRoy. Written by Albert Maltz. Cast: Frank
Sinatra. "Frank Sinatra didn't become a "respected" actor until
almost a decade after this 1945 short, but The House I Live In was
Sinatra?s first Oscar-winning film. The movie, written by future
blacklistee Albert Maltz and set to a song composed by leftist
songwriter Earl Robinson, opens with a gang of kids chasing a kid
who is "different" [i.e., Jewish]. Frank sees the fight and reminds
them of how important putting aside prejudice was to winning World
War II, then he sings "The House I Live In", a heartfelt folksong
(originally recorded by Josh White) about America and its ideals,
and they get the message. It may seem hokey today, but in 1945 the
film was strong enough to win an Oscar for Best Short Subject."

<dt><b>The Jazz Singer</b>(1927)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Alan Crosland. Cast: Al Jolson, Mary McAvoy, Warner
Oland, William Demarest, Eugenie Besserer, Otto Lederer, Josef
Rosenblatt. Jakie Rabinowitz is the son of a Jewish cantor. Turning
his back on family tradition, Jakie transforms himself into
cabaret-entertainer Jack Robin. When Jack comes home to visit his
parents, he is warmly greeted by his mother, but is given the
cold-shoulder by his father, who feels that Jack is a traitor to
his heritage by singing jazz music. On the eve of his biggest show
business triumph, Jack receives word that his father is dying. Out
of respect, Jack foregoes his opening night to attend Atonement
services at the temple and sings the Kol Nidre in his father's
place. In motion picture history, this marks the first feature film
to utilize synchronous sound. Actor Al Jolson's songs include
"Toot, toot, tootsie", "Blue skies", and "Mammy". Special features:
Disc 1: Commentary by Ron Hutchinson, founder of The Vitaphone
Projects and Nighthawks Bandleader Vince Giordano; vintage Al
Jolson short films: "A plantation act," "An intimate dinner in
celebration of Warner Bros. Silver Jubilee," "Hollywood handicap,"
and "A day at Santa Anita" ; radio show adaptation and movie
trailer gallery; classic homage cartoon "I love to singa" which
features a jazz-singing Owl Jolson. 89 min. <b>DVD 8594; vhs

<p>"Since its premiere in 1927, many jazz critcs have overlooked
The Jazz Singer, America's pioneer talking picture, in the history
of American jazz film. Despite its title, the talkie's account of
Old World vs. New World tension and Jewish assimilation has little
to do with the jazz sound made famous by such artists as Louis
Armstrong and Jelly Roll Morton. Yet as crtic Krin Gabbard argues,
the film's appropriation of the title jazz reflects the cultural
understanding of "jazz" during the American Jazz Age. In the 1920s,
jazz, referring in general to up-tempo music, represented the
emotional release and freedom of a generation striving to break
established social conventions. While African American
contributions to jazz were largely overlooked in the rise of Paul
Whiteman and Al jolson's fame, blackface minstrelsy of the age
represented white Americans attempt to ventriloquize blacks
associated with supposed freedom of Negro primitivisim. Using jazz
to represent Raboniwitz's break from Old World tradition and
featuring a finale in blackface minstrelsy, The Jazz Singer (as
Gabbard argues) lays the foundation for cultural representations of
jazz in American cinema." [<a href=

<dt><b>The Man Who Cried</b>(UK / France, 2000)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Sally Potter. Cast: Christina Ricci, Cate
Blanchett, John Turturro, Johnny Depp, Harry Dean Stanton. "A
Russian Jewish father emigrates to America in 1923, with a promise
to send for his mother and young daughter when he is settled. When
his village is burned in a pogrom, his mother is killed and his
daughter is separated from other youngsters who make it to the port
to emigrate. She ends up on a ship bound for England, where she is
renamed Suzie and raised by a British family. Many years later,
Suzie's talent for singing and dancing sees her accepted into a
Paris dance troupe where she is befriended by Lola, a fellow dancer
from Moscow. Cesar, a handsome brooding gypsy who works with the
troupe later becomes her lover. Lola pursues Dante, an egotistical
tenor who is performing in the area. All is well until the Nazis
march into Paris, and Suzie's Russian Jewish background places her
in danger. She must decide whether to leave Cesar and her friends
and continue the search for her father in America" [<a href=

<dd>Directed by Irving Rapper. Cast Gene Kelly, Natalie Wood,
Claire Trevor, Everett Sloane, Marty Milner, Carolyn Jones, George
Tobias, Martin Balsam, Jesse White, Edward Byrnes, Paul Picerni,
Alan Reed, Ruta Lee, Ed Wynn. "While working as a counselor at a
summer camp, college-student Marjorie Morgenstern falls for
32-year-old Noel Airman, a would-be dramatist working at a nearby
summer theater. Like Marjorie, he is an upper-middle-class New York
Jew (born 'Ehrman'), but has fallen away from his roots, and
Marjorie's parents object among other things to his lack of a
suitable profession, such as medicine or law. Noel himself warns
Marjorie repeatedly that she's much too naive and conventional for
him, but they nonetheless fall in love. As they pursue an
on-again-off-again relationship, Marjorie completes her studies at
Hunter College, and works to establish an acting career, while Noel
first leaves the theater for a job with an advertising agency, but
later completes a musical he'd started writing before he and
Marjorie had first met. Meanwhile, their relationship deepens
(though, consistent with '50s Hollywood mores, the more
full-fledged sexuality in their relationship is never explicitly
communicated). They plan to marry, but after the musical's critical
failure on Broadway, Noel runs away. Marjorie finally tracks him
down at the summer theater where they first met--and, realizing
that this is probably where he belongs, finally gives up on the
relationship. Helping her to move on with her life is Wally, once
Noel's assistant, now a very successful Broadway playwright, and
all along, Marjorie's unrequited lover. The movie ends with a clear
implication Wally and Marjorie will finally be a couple." [<a href=

<dt><b>Mel Gibson's Passion: an Interview with Mel Gibson</b></dt>
<dd>"In this special edition of "Primetime", ABC News' Diane Sawyer
interviews filmmaker Mel Gibson about his highly controversial
movie, "The Passion of the Christ." Gibson discusses his own
religious beliefs with Sawyer and explains how his faith helped him
overcome struggles with addiction and other personal problems at a
spiritual low point in his life. He responds to charges that the
movie's portrayal of the Jewish role in the death of Christ will
encourage anti-Semitism. In addition, he explains why he felt it
necessary to exhibit such a graphic depiction of Christ's
crucifixion on film and discusses his decision to tell the story in
both Aramaic and Latin. Sawyer also interviews Abraham Foxman, the
national director of the Anti-Defamation League. Religious
scholars, members of the clergy and others assess the film's
potential impact." 2004. 40 min. <b>DVD 2679</b></dd>

probably saw this film at a fairground -- a prime audience for

<dt><b>The Dybbuk</b> (Poland, 1937)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Michael Waszynski. Cast: Avrom Marevsky, Isaac
Semberg, Lili Liliana, Leon Liebgold, Moyshe Lipman, Dina Halpern,
Max Bozyk, Shmuel Landau. Years after their parents had made a
pledge that they would marry, a young couple meet and fall in love.
The father of the young man had long before perished and the young
woman's father, forgetting his vow, keeps the two apart. The film
concerns unfullfilled love, broken promises, and the supernatural,
as the persona of the youth enters his beloved's body and possesses
her. "Considered by some to be the greatest of Yiddish films, it
was certainly the boldest undertaking, requiring special sets and
unusual lighting. In Der Dibuk, as in mysticism and love, the past
has a magnetic pull on the present, and the dead are as alluring as
the living. Khonnon (Leon Liebgold) and Leah (Lili Liliana),
betrothed before birth, meet, knowing nothing of the vows. Khonnon
becomes obsessed with Leah and begins to dabble in the kabbala.
Leah is betrothed to a wealthy man, and Khonnon offers her his
body, soul and intelligence--via Satan--and dies. Leah's father
invites the spirit of her dead mother to the wedding; Leah invites
Khonnon from the grave. The film is filled with haunting,
unforgettable scenes that verge on the surreal, set to choreography
by Judith Berg. Jewish mysticism links with expressionism--as in
Nosferatu or Vampyr, man is an insubstantial presence in the
cinematic ether. S. Ansky's play was written during the turbulent
years of 1912-1917; Waszynski's 1937 film was made during another
period of prewar unease. It was shot on location in rural Poland,
and captures a rich folk heritage. Noted Warsaw historian Meyer
Balaban oversaw the accuracy of the presentation." [from <a href=

<dt><b>Green Fields (Grine Felder)</b>(USA, 1937)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Edgar G. Ulmer. "Based on the play by Peretz
Hirschbein. An ascetic-quixotic yeshiva student sets out in search
of "true Jews"--those whose spirit is the more profound for their
connection to the land, unadulterated by the evils of city life. He
finds that and more, as he becomes the quarry of two farm families
who want him for their children's tutor. Quite in spite of himself
the dreamy pedant (Michael Goldstein) inspires a variety of desires
including a lust for learning in the irrepressible Tsine (Helen
Beverly) and her wide-eyed brother Avrem-Yankl (Herschel Bernardi).
Theater director/actor Jacob Ben-Ami is credited with giving the
film its "authentic flavor." On the other hand, who but Edgar G.
Ulmer--Hollywood's stylish, expressionist "King of the Bs"--could
have transformed New Jersey locations and a New York studio set
into bucolic-rustic Old Russia, with its delicately balanced
relationships? "Green Fields celebrates a vanished world of tribal
wholeness and stubborn piety.... Sweet but unsentimental, the film
exudes a dreamy pantheism unique in Yiddish Film." (J. Hoberman)."

<dt><b>The Jester (Purimshpiler)</b> (Poland / USA, 1937)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Joseph Green. Cast: Miriam Kressyn, Zygmund Turkow,
Hymie Jacobson. A romantic comedy about a drifer, who wanders from
shtetl to shtetl. He finds brief happiness when he falls in love
with a shoemaker's daughter in a small Galician town in this
likable fantasy about a love triangle and man's quest for the
unobtainable. ""Set in a Galician shtetl before World War II, this
musical comedy focuses on three characters: the sad vagabond
peasant jester, Getsel; a vaudeville performer in a traveling
circus; and a shoemaker's daughter, whose father tries to marry her
into a prominent family. The climax is a traditional Purim festival
during which the performers drive off the rich suitor's family..."
(National Center for Jewish Film) "A wistful romance that's
interspersed with songs but rooted in the wisecracks and banter of
oral Yiddish culture. Green's films are always part documentary...
even the studio scenes are populated by an army of Old World Jewish
extras." (J. Hoberman) Green created a convincing "shtetl set" on
the outskirts of Warsaw, and also filmed on location in Krakow.
Aside from the song lyrics, the famed Itzik Manger wrote some of
the dialogue." [from <a href=

<dt><b>Jewish Luck (Menahem-Mendl; Yevreiskoye schastye; Menakhem
Mendl; Jidische glickn)</b> (Soviet Union, 1925)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Alexander Granovsky. Cast: Solomon Mikhoels, Tamara
Edelheim, S. Epstein, M. Goldblat, I. Rogaler. "This adaptation of
the Menakhem Mendel Letters by Sholem Aleichem, filtered through
Isaac Babel, who wrote the original Russian intertitles, and
photographed by Eduard Tiss&eacute; (before his work with
Eisenstein,) is considered by many to be one of the three or four
finest Yiddish films ever made. With the Moscow Yiddish State
Theater; and starring Solomon Mikhoels in his screen debut, Jewish
Luck represents an extraordinary meeting of Russian-Jewish talent.
Sholem Aleichem made Menakhem Mendl a classic Jewish figure of
tsarist Russia, the luftmensch--literally, a man who lives on
air--whose schemes are only dreams, and whose dreams are of
something vaguely if universally understood as Jewish luck. He
slips from one doomed strike-it-rich scheme to the next, first
failing as a corset salesman, then trying his luck as a "shadkhn."
He falls asleep and dreams that he is outside Odessa's Grand Palace
with Baron de Hirsch, preparing to export these brides to America.
The dream ends after a matchmaking calamity, and Menakhem Mendl,
without money or profession, leaves in search of better "luck.."
Throughout, he refuses to concede to tsarist Russia's oppressive
restriction of Jews. His quixotic persistence transforms Menakhem
Mendel from schlemiel to hero, as Granovsky and Mikhoels uncover
the tragic underpinnings of Sholem Aleichem's comic tales." [from

<dt><b>A Letter to Mother (A brivele der mamen)</b> (Poland / USA,
1938)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Joseph Green. Cast: Lucy Gehrman, Misha Gehrman,
Edmund Zayenda. Set in the Polish Ukraine and New York City, the
film traces the break-up of a family due to stress, poverty, the
chaos of war and the difficulties of immigrant life. One of the
last Yiddish films to be produced in Warsaw, this moving story
focuses on one Jewish mother's efforts to keep her family together.
"...arguably the most artful and shameless of Yiddish weepies." (J.
Hoberman) "Set in the Ukraine before World War I and in New York
afterwards, this was one of the last films made in Poland (Warsaw)
before the Nazi invasion. Its tale of loss, family disintegration
and poverty serves director Joseph Green as a metaphor for the
displacements and difficulties facing European Jews in 1939. Lucy
Gehrman's performance as the storekeeper-mother, whose heroic
attention to the everyday eventually rewards her travails, stands
out, as do Max Bozyk and Chane Levin's comic interludes." (National
Center for Jewish Film) A wonderful mix of intense melodrama and
stylized comedy." 100 min. <b>DVD 1534</b></dd>

<dt><b>Mamele: Little Mother</b> (Poland, 1938)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Joseph Green. Cast: Molly Picon, Edmund Zayenda,
Max Bozyk. Molly Picon is Khavtshi, the youngest daughter of a
widower, who is left with the responsibility of tending house for a
helpless and indifferent family of seven. As such, she becomes
their little mother. Filled with that special brand of humor and
song that made Molly Picon the undisputed queen of Yiddish
musicals. "Ten years after her stage success in Mamele, Molly Picon
was still able to pull off the role of Khavtshi, who promises her
dying mother she will look after her four older siblings and
perpetually unemployed Papa (Max Bozyk). The "little mother"
exercises her creative impulses by selecting her sisters' suitors
and acting as advice-central for the tenement. Though unappreciated
by all (but us), she's both vivacious and self-aware: in one of the
film's high points she sings her way through the stages of a
woman's life, from girlhood to old age. Transposed from the stage
play's Lower East Side to Lodz, Poland, director Green's hometown,
and edited just in time for its makers to leave Warsaw for
friendlier ground, "Mamele embraces prewar Polish-Jewish life in
all its diversity, including tenements and unemployment, nightclubs
and Jewish gangsters, and religious Jews at Succoth, the harvest
festival." (National Center for Jewish Film)" 90 min. <b>DVD

<dt><b>Our Children (Undzer kinder)</b> (1948)</dt>
<dd>Directors, Natan Gross and Shaul Goskind. Suppressed by the
Polish Communist government as too "pro-Zionist" and lost for over
thirty years, the film features the comedy duo of Dzigan and
Shumacher who had recently returned from the Soviet Union, and
Jewish children who had survived the Holocaust. Directed on
location in 1948 at the Helenowek Colony, an orphanage/school near
Lodz, this film includes Dzigan and Shumacher's performance as all
the characters in Sholem Aleichem's "Kasrilevke brent (Krasrilvke
is burning)," and an exchange of roles where they become the
children's audience. ""Not only among the first films about the
Holocaust, it is also the first to critique its representation."
(J. Hoberman) Suppressed by the postwar Communist government as too
"pro-Zionist," then lost for over thirty years, Unzere Kinder
features the comedy duo Shimen Dzigan and Yisroel Schumacher.
Recently returned to Poland from the Soviet Union, they explore the
impact of the Holocaust on survivors, particularly the children of
an orphanage/school near Lodz. Performing for the children, the
comics are told in no uncertain terms that they have
oversentimentalized the wartime conditions that these kids survived
by their own wits. In the most delightful scene, the duo stage a
playlet based on Sholem Aleichem's "Kasrilevke Is Burning," in
which they take all the roles including the women. The children
themselves perform in this film that explores the healing
possibilities of song, dance, and storytelling, and the question of
whether it is more therapeutic to remember or to forget." [from

<dt><b>The Singing Blacksmith (Yankl der Shmid)</b> (USA,
1937)</dt>
<dd>Director, Edgar G. Ulmer. Cast: Moishe Oysher, Miriam Riselle,
Florence Weiss. "Yankel Der Shmid was a vehicle for the rich vocal
talents of cantor and matinee idol Moishe Oysher (who works a
little "scat" into the repertoire). Shot on the cheap in a "shtetl"
created in New Jersey, using extras from a nearby monastery (they
had beards), The Singing Blacksmith looks more like Edgar Ulmer's
Hollywood B films than his better-known Green Fields, but "it was
probably modeled on the Soviet musicals of the period: folkloric,
montage-filled, and thoroughly class-conscious" (National Film
Theatre). Though set in the old world, it speaks to anxieties of
the transplanted Jew in the character of Yankl, a
proletarian-identified smithy who is tempted by drink and women
until centered by the love of a progressive young woman. "This
colorful romantic melodrama brims with stock comic characters--a
matchmaker, peasants, a suspicious mother-in-law, a seductive
woman, and a pious weak husband--but their activities pale before
Oysher's splendid voice and presence, and Ulmer's poetic
direction." (National Center for Jewish Film) 105 min. <b>DVD 5220;

<dt><b>Tevye the Milkman (Tevye der Milkhiker)</b> (USA, 1939)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Maurice Schwartz. Cast: Maurice Schwartz, Rebecca
Weintraub, Miriam Riselle, Leon Liebgold, Paula Lubelska, Julius
Adler. "When the restored Tevye was re-released in 1979-1980,
critics felt they had found the screen Tevye in Maurice Schwartz,
the great Yiddish actor-director. Tevye the Dairyman is a kind of
Jewish Everyman, struggling to hold on to that which defines him
against the winds of change. The film, adapted from a stage play
written by Sholem Aleichem based on his famous stories, focuses on
two crises in Tevye's life: the conversion of his daughter Khave
(Miriam Riselle) to Christianity in order to marry a Russian
intellectual, and the expulsion of the Jews from the small Russian
town that was Tevye's birthplace. Critic Rob Baker wrote, "Tevye is
a pastoral gem comparable to much of the best of Pagnol [and]
Renoir.... Filmed in Long Island, the film's accuracy in capturing
the cultural patina of the day-to-day life of Russian Jews is
striking." In 1991, this film was selected for inclusion in the
United States National Film Registry." [from <a href=

<dd>Directed by Aubrey Scotto &amp; Sidney Goldin. Cast: Maurice
Schwartz, Rubin Golberg, Judith Abarbanel, Zvee Scooler, Mark
Schweid, Sally Schor, Jacob Mestel, Rebecca Weintraub, Sam Gertler.
""Maurice Schwartz, the monarch of New York's Yiddish theater,
plays a sweatshop owner in Uncle Moses.... Patriarch and exploiter,
cunning businessman and dazzled suitor, Moses is a symphony of
contradictions, which Schwartz orchestrates brilliantly." (Richard
Corliss, Time, 1992) The first Yiddish sound film to deal with a
contemporary social theme, Uncle Moses is a portrayal of life on
the Lower East Side, depicting transplanted Jews whose values are
not so much unraveling as transmogrifying before our eyes in the
sweatshops and crowded tenements. Moses--in Poland, a lowly
butcher, in America, the benevolent despot of Orchard Street--would
seem the apotheosis of change, but not really. He himself
represents an old order, the patriarch who asserts that his workers
are mishpokhe (family--but they're not buying it), whose vanity
produces sundry progeny, whose deep pockets buy him a bride (or
rather, her family.) Change comes only when he realizes that, as a
human being, he is powerlessness in pressed pants. Then Schwartz's
delightfully comic ham transforms into that thing that had him
known as "the Olivier of the Yiddish stage."" [from <a href=

<dt><b>Yidl Mitn Fidl (Yidl With a Fiddle)</b> (Poland / USA,
1935)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Joseph Green and Jan Nowina-Przybylski. "The first
truly international Yiddish hit. Molly Picon's vaudeville antics
are backed by some of the most enchanting music of any Yiddish
film, in the tale of itinerant klezmorim and the girl (Molly at
37!) who disguises herself as a boy to join them. The plot takes
them through countryside to town and the Warsaw stage, even to
Second Avenue, New York, and is not without romance nor a feminist
touch: Yid'l gets it all, her man and a musical career. The film
"offers a still-fresh collection of Picon's characterizations and
routines--ranging from the tipsy yeshive boy to the overexcited
chatterbox to the pert gamine." (J. Hoberman) Joseph Green filmed
on location in Warsaw and Kazimierz (where he employed shtetl
inhabitants as extras) and the result is a wonderful folk comedy
that has the authentic feel of small-town and urban Polish-Jewish
life, affirming both in a period of growing anti-Semitism. Opening
in New York City at the Ambassador Theater in January 1937, the
film received much critical praise. The New York Times: "Miss Picon
puts so much infectious gayety, not forgetting the proper modicum
of sadness, into the action that the result is genuine
entertainment." Its success set into motion the so-called Golden
Age of Yiddish Cinema, a period which lasted from 1936 until the
Nazi invasion of Poland in September, 1939." [from <a href=
