<dd>Directed by Tex Avery. ""When the cat's away, the mice will
play." The cat is taking a nap, so the mice invade the pantry and

<dt><b>All This and Rabbit Stew</b> (1941)</dt>
<dd>Another dumb hunter decides to make Bugs Bunny his dinner.
Singing "Ah'm gonna ketch me a rah-hah-habit," the slow-witted
little black boy (complete with coal-black skin, big red blubbery
lips, excessively large feet and a lazy sing-song voice) sees
rabbit tracks: "Well, shut mah mouth- rabbit tracks!" He finds
Bugs' hole, into which he sticks his gun barrel (in a manner akin
to Elmer Fudd): "OK, Mr. Rabbit, I'se got you covered- now put up
those hands or else I'll blitzkrieg ya!!" After several typically
clever gags, Bugs shakes some dice in his fist, the kid's eyes
moving up and down with Bugs' hand. "Whatchoo got there, man? It
couldn't be a pair of them?" They gamble until Bugs has literally
won all of the kid's clothes off his back! Walking away, dressed in
the kid's overalls and dragging the rifle behind them, a
triumphant-looking Bugs mocks the wannabe hunter with: "I'm gonna
catch me a wah-hah-habit." The hunter kid stands with only a fig
leaf covering his... you know. He says, "Well, shut my mouth and
call me Adam." Before the "iris" closes on the naked hunter, a
smiling Bugs grabs the fig leaf off the kid and proudly holds it
aloft. Leon Schlesinger Studios; Avery uncredited. <b>DVD 9356; DVD

skywriting hearts (Cecil almost drowns) and fancy dives (Cecil
almost crashes, then gets into a fight with a shark, a turtle, and
a starfish). Just when you think Cecil hasn't got a chance, a
gorilla shows up wearing a shirt labeling him the villian (in case
you didn't know); Cecil grabs a shirt labeling him the hero, fights
off the villain, and gets the girl. <b>DVD 8512</b></dd>

The reader pays no heed, and gets up at 5 AM. Alas, the worm has
seen the book, so is alerted and evades the bird. And sure enough,
before long, the fox shows up and soon has the bird in his grasp.
The worm takes pity, though, and lures a bee into stinging the fox
so he'll release the bird. The bird heads home to safety, but
unlike his brothers, he's not interested when mammy asks if he
wants worms for breakfast (and the worm pops up to say, "neither
does I, mammy.") <b>DVD 9356; vhs 999:2142</b></dd>
