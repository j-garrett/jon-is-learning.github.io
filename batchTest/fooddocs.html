<dd>Explores the social, cultural and dietary factors that led to

about two-thirds of Americans are overweight, and of those, half
are already obese, and an alarming percentage are children. This
program also critically examines the variety of weight loss
programs whose underyling principles are often contradictory.

<dd>Childhood obesity is a national health crisis and one shared
increasingly by other nations. Take Britain for example. Jamie
Oliver, the celebrity chef and best-selling cookbook author known
as "The Naked Chef," is also a young father. Last year, he grew fed
up with the junk food being served to British school children and
embraced the issue as a personal mission bringing it to the
attention of the British public. Next, Oliver turned his attention
to American schools. He came to the U.S. to stir up the same
attention to nutritionally-challenged school lunch programs here.
ABC News reports on Jamie Oliver's shenanigans in trying to
convince both Brits and Americans that school lunches need a

<dd>In its rush to riches, China may be devouring its ability to
feed its own people. This program addresses the country's
disturbing lack of food security, examining the roles played by

disadvantaged farmers whose lands and water sources have been
ruined by factory waste --a problem widespread in rural China. The
film also spotlights Pan Yue, China's outspoken Vice Minister of
the Environment, and links several factors --including real estate
deals, land seizures, and climate change --to the sad reality that

decades Northwest agriculture was focused on a few big crops for

<dt><b>Good Food/Bad Food: Obesity in American Children</b></dt>
<dd>Since the mid-1970s, there has been a tripling of the number of
children who are overweight or at risk for being overweight. This
film discusses some of the reasons for this phenomenon--there is
little physical exercise, and there is poor food choice for
children due to things such as the ease of fast food, TV
advertisements, and vending machines and poor food lunches in
schools. The result of this rise in obesity among children is an
accompanying rise in physical problems associated with obesity
formerly seen in adults, such as heart disease, type II diabetes,
and sleep apnea. The film closes by showing a variety of activities
and programs that can fight obesity in children. School lunches can
be made more healthy and children can be made more involved with
their food (such as growing a garden), physical education programs
can be (re)instituted into the curriculum, and family-centered
activities can be developed. [Produced by]: Allie Light, Irving

products effects underdeveloped nations. The U.S., as the world's
dominant producer of cereal grains, is an important player in the

way of eliminating agricultural surpluses but food aid can prevent
poor nations from becoming self-sufficient because the government
of those nations has no incentive to develop policies to increase
food production. c1988. 20 min. <b>Video/C 5938</b></dd>

<dd>The film takes a wry look at the cultural confrontation of East

To many Indians it is a symbol of Western cultural
imperialism--Western greed undermining traditional values in India.

roles in determining the foods we love and those we just can't
stomach! With help from nutritionist Ros Ryan, and the experiences
and opinions of everyday people from around the world, we reveal
the physiological, psychological, social, and economic factors that
affect our choice of foods. From satiety - our bodies telling us
whether we are hungry or full - to positive and negative
associations we have with certain foods, and the impact of culture,
religion, lifestyle, peers, and the media, this is a rewarding
examination of why we prefer certain types of foods over others.

new book, "The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four
Meals," with Davia Nelson of NPR's The Kitchen Sisters and
co-author of "Hidden Kitchens: Stories, Recipes &amp; More". What
should we have for dinner? According to Michael Pollan the answer
may determine our survival as a species. Should we eat a fast-food
hamburger? Something organic? Or perhaps something we hunt, gather,
or grow ourselves? The omnivore's dilemma has returned with a
vengeance, as the cornucopia of the modern American supermarket and
fast-food outlet confronts us with a bewildering and treacherous
food landscape. What's at stake in our eating choices is not only
our own and our children's health, but the health of the
environment that sustains life on earth. UC Berkeley, April 17,

<dt><b>Our Daily Poison</b></dt>
<dd>According to the World Health Organization, the incidence of
cancer has doubled over the last thirty years. Over this period,
the increase in leukemia and brain tumours in children has been
around 2% per year. The WHO has observed a similar trend for

disorders. This documentary launches an in-depth investigation into
everyday products and the systems charged with regulating them,
examining the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and
the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) archives. Seeking answers
the filmmaker manages to talk her way into secret meetings, and
meets with regulators and respected renegade researchers throughout
North American and Europe. The film shows that the main cause of
the epidemic is environmental: the result of the 100,000 chemical
molecules that have invaded our environment, and primarily our
food, since the end of the Second World War. Directed by

<dt><b>Planning for Good Eating</b> (1946)</dt>
<dd>Animated short. Walt Disney.Nutrition is the topic of this
short, which tells us about Careless Charlie and his family, who
are run down because they just keep eating the same food - beans
and corn bread. The needs of the human body are said to fall into
three classes: fruits &amp; vegetables, animal products, and grains
and roots. Yes, it's preaching and the message is a diet of
variety. But if Careless Charlie can be known as Careful Charlie,
chances are, you can, too, provided that your name is Charlie!

"10" height="10"><b>The Food Machine.</b> Discusses the farm crisis
in the United States in which small farms are being bought by large
corporations. This pattern has been transplanted to underdeveloped
countries, such as the Sudan resulting in increased food costs and
a destabilizing of the rural population. <b>Video/C 5935</b></dd>

<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10"><b>The Avoidable Famine.</b> Examines the impact
of changes in traditional farming methods on the economy of Sudan.
When the Sudan was a colony of Great Britain, the best farm land
was used to grow cotton but a drop in cotton prices in the 1970's
dictated a return to traditional food crops, which made the Sudan
self-sufficient in food. Then the International Monetary Fund
insisted that the nation return to growing cotton as a condition
for making loans to the Sudan. Cotton prices remained low and the
nation was forced to import grain from the U.S.--thus pushing the
Sudan deeper into debt while the people starved. <b>DVD X994

rapid industrial expansion in Brazil and the need for land reform.
Brazil's "economic miracle" of the 1970's was supposed to "trickle
down" to the poorest segments of the population but only the top
10% of the population benefitted from the economic policy, while
the gap between rich and poor grew. The resulting huge debt has
caused an even greater emphasis on the export of food, causing
shortages and higher prices in Brazil. <b>DVD X995 [preservation

international trade of agricultural products effects underdeveloped
nations. The U.S., as the world's dominant producer of
cerealgrains, is an important player in the global trade of food.
Grain exports are seen in the U.S. as a good way of eliminating
agricultural surpluses but food aid can prevent poor nations from
becoming self-sufficient because the government of those nations
has no incentive to develop policies to increase food production.

approaches to the problem of hunger in Kerala, india and
Bangladesh. In Kerala government-run "fair price shops" assure that
every person can afford basic nutrition and government developed
programs assure high standards of health, education and birth
control. Bangladesh, however, is heavily dependent on foreign aid,
most of which is used to support the urban middle class while the
rural poor remain malnourished, uneducated and trapped in a cycle
of poverty. <b>DVD 9827 [preservation copy]; vhs Video/C

<dt><b>The Real Dirt on Farmer John</b></dt>
<dd>The Peterson family farm is located in Caledonia, 75 miles
outside Chicago. Like many farms, it thrived for decades and
expanded in the 1960s to survive. As John Peterson approached his

Thus, John became a farmer, albeit a strange farmer, with one foot
in the counterculture and the other in rich organic soil. The film
explores the Rockwellian experience of growing up on a Midwestern
farm, the calamitous failure of family farms in the age of
corporate farming, and the rise of organic gardening and Community
Supported Agriculture. Special features: "Bitter Harvest"

Although North America is the epicentre of obesity, this disease is
