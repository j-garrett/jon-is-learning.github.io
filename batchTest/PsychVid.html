The story of the relationship between Sigmund Freud and his
American nephew, Edward Bernays. Bernays invented the public
relations profession in the 1920s and was the first person to take
Freud's ideas to manipulate the masses. He showed American
corporations how they could make people want things they didn't
need by systematically linking mass-produced goods to their
unconscious desires. Bernays was one of the main architects of the
modern techniques of mass-consumer persuasion, using every trick in
the book, from celebrity endorsement and outrageous PR stunts, to
eroticising the motorcar. His most notorious coup was breaking the
taboo on women smoking by persuading them that cigarettes were a
symbol of independence and freedom. But Bernays was convinced that
this was more than just a way of selling consumer goods. It was a
new political idea of how to control the masses. By satisfying the
inner irrational desires that his uncle had identified, people
could be made happy and thus docile.</dd>

<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10" border="0"><b>Episode 2: The Engineering of
Consent.</b> The program explores the ideas of Ernest Dichter and
how those in power in post-war America used Freud's ideas about the
unconscious mind to try and control the masses. Politicians and
planners came to believe Freud's underlying premise - that deep
within all human beings were dangerous and irrational desires and
fears. They were convinced that it was the unleashing of these
instincts that had led to the barbarism of Nazi Germany. To stop it
ever happening again they set out to find ways to control this
hidden enemy within the human mind. Sigmund Freud's daughter, Anna,
and his nephew, Edward Bernays, provided the centrepiece
philosophy. The US government, big business, and the CIA used their
ideas to develop techniques to manage and control the minds of the
American people. But rather than a cynical exercise in
manipulation, those in power believed that the only way to make
democracy work and create a stable society was to repress the
savage barbarism that lurked just under the surface of normal
American life.</dd>

"10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Episode 3: There is a Policeman
Inside All Our Heads, He Must Be Destroyed.</b> In the 1960s, a
radical group of psychotherapists challenged the influence of
Freudian ideas in America. They were inspired by the ideas of
Wilhelm Reich, a pupil of Freud's, who had turned against him and
was hated by the Freud family. He believed that the inner self did
not need to be repressed and controlled. It should be encouraged to
express itself. Out of this came a political movement that sought
to create new beings free of the psychological conformity that had
been implanted in people's minds by business and politics. This
program shows how this rapidly developed in America through
self-help movements like Werner Erhard's Erhard Seminar Training -
into the irresistible rise of the expressive self: the Me
Generation. But the American corporations soon realised that this
new self was not a threat but their greatest opportunity. It was in
their interest to encourage people to feel they were unique
individuals and then sell them ways to express that individuality.
To do this they turned to techniques developed by Freudian
psychoanalysts to read the inner desires of the new self.</dd>

"10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Episode 4: Eight People Sipping
Wine in Kettering.</b> This episode explains how politicians on the
left, in both Britain and America, turned to the techniques
developed by business to read and fulfill the inner desires of the
self. Both New Labour, under Tony Blair, and the Democrats, led by
Bill Clinton, used the focus group, which had been invented by
psychoanalysts, in order to regain power. They set out to mould
their policies to people's inner desires and feelings, just as
capitalism had learnt to do with products. Out of this grew a new
culture of public relations and marketing in politics, business and
journalism. One of its stars in Britain was Matthew Freud who
followed in the footsteps of his relation, Edward Bernays, the
inventor of public relations in the 1920s. The politicians believed
they were creating a new and better form of democracy, one that
truly responded to the inner feelings of individual. But what they
didn't realise was that the aim of those who had originally created
these techniques had not been to liberate the people but to develop
a new way of controlling them.</dd>

4 part series updating the controversial 1971 Stanford prison
experiment, Dr. Philip Zimbardo's inquiry into the power of social
situations to distort identity and erode moral behavior. In this
final episode, the primal exercise of negotiation and opportunism
is explicated as 12 prisoners and guards band together to form a
new and balanced society. Mere hours later, faced with an inability
to enforce the commune rules, four members fill the power vacuum by
launching a ruthless bid for control of the group. <b>DVD

<dt><b>The Face of Evil</b></dt>
<dd>Surveys the long history of attempts to identify and categorize
the physiognomy of evil, from the paintings of Hieronymous Bosch to
such "sciences" as physiognomics, phrenology, eugenics, and
anthropometrics, to latterday notions of criminal anthropology. The
film illustrates these dubious efforts through the historical case
study of Bruno Ludke, an alleged serial killer arrested in Germany
in 1943. The stockily-built, mentally deficient young man, who was
felt by Nazi authorities to have the appearance of a "born
criminal," became a guinea pig for a series of biological
experiments to validate their beliefs in racial categories, of
atavistic or degenerate types, a hierarchical ranking of the
"Other." Directed by Davide Tosco. c2006. 52 min. <b>DVD

touches virtually every aspect of our lives. Many of its current
themes can be traced back to questions that have confronted
scholars throughout history. But today the study of behavior,
thoughts and feelings is bolstered by new scientific tools and
approaches. As a result the field is expanding in directions that
would have been unheard of just a few decades ago, providing us

walks on the beach at dawn. Although he is alert to his

is captured and converted into signals that can be recognized by
the central nervous system. The ultimate destination for these
signals is the cerebral cortex. Christof Koch, Gilles Laurent, and
others examine the ways sensory receptors take in stimuli as well

<dt><b>The Minnesota Semi-starvation Experiment</b></dt>
<dd>Jim Graham tells of his experiences as a conscientious objector
during World War II as one of 36 "guinea pigs" in a one-year
experiment in semi-starvation. The experiment was born of concern
for starving persons in Europe in prison camps and concentration
camps, and the general population suffering from food shortages.
The experiment explored the questions: What is best to feed a
starving person to bring him/her back to health? What is the most
economical use of food materials when supplies are severely
limited? This was the first opportunity to study changes in the
body under starvation conditions, and to determine what to feed a
starving person during recovery. The experiment started in Nov.
1944 and was conducted by Dr. Ancel Keys, Director of Physiological
Hygiene at the University of Minnesota. c1990. 22 min. <b>DVD

with parents addicted to heroin by teaching them how to repair the
damage to family wrought by drug abuse, and in spite of it, how to
raise strong, resilient children. In a second program, vigilant
counselors in Dade County schools watch for kids at risk of
becoming drug addicts, and offer immediate counseling for thosewho
are already involved with drugs. Nicotine addiction is addressed by
a program that provides classes designed to prevent students from
smoking, and another that helps them stop if they've already begun
to smoke. School officials, counselors, and students are

<dt><b>Nursery University</b></dt>
<dd>In communities across the United States, competition to get
into the best schools is starting early. New York City is at the
center of this phenomenon, where nursery schools have become the

toddlers on a track that some believe paves the way to the Ivy
League. Follows five Manhattan families during the year-long
preschool application process, and also gains access into the
school admissions departments to reveal the behind-the-scenes
antics of this intensely outrageous private school realm. Special
features: tips from the experts: advice for getting into nursery
schools; audio commentary with the filmmakers; Q&amp;A's with the
parents, admissions officers, and filmmakers; deleted scenes;
trailer; filmmaker biographies. Directed, produced &amp; written by

<dt><b>Refrigerator Mothers</b></dt>
<dd>From the 1950s through the early 1970s, the American medical
establishment thought it had found the cause of autism: poor
mothering. Doctors presumed that the bizarre behaviors of autistic
children - rigid rituals, difficulty with speech, extreme
self-isolation - stemmed from their mothers' emotional frigidity.
We now know that autism is a brain disorder, not the result of poor
parenting. But for a whole generation of women branded as cold
"refrigerator mothers," the damage had already been done. 2002.. 54

<dt><b>Different From You: Unfulfilled Promises to the Mentally
Ill.</b></dt>
<dd>One of the glaring social problems of American cities is
homelessness, but only recently have we realized that most
homelessness reflects psychiatric disease. This documentary follows
the medical rounds of an urban family physician, Milt Kogan, as he
services the homeless mentally ill. Through his interactions and
through commentary by the mentally ill and by mental health
professionals, the film illustrates how patients experience
symptoms, deal with vagrancy, drug abuse, and societal hostility,
and maintain hope and aspirations. 2002. 60 min. <b>Video/C

<dd>A compelling documentary about the loss of human rights
suffered by psychiatric patients in a state mental institution,
filmed over a six-week period in a locked ward at Metropolitan

<dt><b>The Lobotomist</b></dt>
<dd>Lobotomy was hailed by The New York Times as a groundbreaking
medical procedure that promised hope to the most distressed
mentally ill patients and their families. But what began as an
operation of last resort was soon being performed at some fifty
state asylums, often with devastating results. Little more than a
decade after his rise to fame, Walter Freeman, the neurologist who
championed the procedure, was decried as a moral monster, and
lobotomy one of the most barbaric mistakes of modern medicine.
Through interviews with Dr. Freeman's former patients and their
families, his students, and medical historians, this program offers
an unprecendented look at one of the darkest chapters in
psychiatric history. Produced and directed by Barak Goodman and
John Maggio. c2008. 60 min. <b>DVD 9480</b></dd>

<dt><b>The Medicated Child</b></dt>
<dd>Ten years ago, stimulants like Ritalin and Adderall were the
drugs of choice to treat behavioral issues in children. Today,
children as young as four years old, are being prescribed more
powerful anti-psychotic medications that are much less understood.
The drugs can cause serious side effects and virtually nothing is
known about their long-term impact. The increase in the use of
anti-psychotics is directly tied to the rising incidence of one
particular diagnosis, bipolar disorder. Experts estimate that the
number of kids with the diagnosis is now over a million and rising.

jails and prisons become its new asylums? This program goes deep
inside Ohio's state prison system to explore the complex and

<dt><b>The Medicated Child</b></dt>
<dd>Ten years ago, stimulants like Ritalin and Adderall were the
drugs of choice to treat behavioral issues in children. Today,
children as young as four years old, are being prescribed more
powerful anti-psychotic medications that are much less understood.
The drugs can cause serious side effects and virtually nothing is
known about their long-term impact. The increase in the use of
anti-psychotics is directly tied to the rising incidence of one
particular diagnosis, bipolar disorder. Experts estimate that the
number of kids with the diagnosis is now over a million and rising.
Written, produced and directed by Marcela Gaviria. Originally
presented as a segment on the television program Frontline in 2008.

(1952, 12 min.) Age 13: This is a beautiful, dark film by Sid Davis
that shows the downward spiral of a young 13 year old boy after the
death of his mother. <b>Age of turmoil</b>: Aimed perhaps more at
parents than teenagers, this films shows what six different teens
do during their day while explaining the how and why of their
actions in regards to their changing adolescent world.
<b>Discipline during adolescence</b>: Showing multiple ways to
parent, this film follows a father's choice of punishment for a
rebellious son and also a mother's choice. In the end, neither
options seem to work very well. Which way would you choose? <b>Boy
with a knife</b>: A young boy with a troubled home life uses a
knife to gain control over his environment and the people around
him. Chuck Connors, as a social worker, helps him find and
understand the better path. Narrated by Richard Widmark.
<b>Cheating</b>: John Taylor is caught cheating when he struggle
with his math studies and gets "extra" help from his friend Mary.

A chance to play (1950, 19 min.) <b>Am I trustworthy</b>: Young
Johnny, who feels left out because he wasn't elected treasurer,
learns an important lesson about being trustworthy.
<b>Understanding your ideals</b>: In this film a young man learns
that to be healthy one must understand the difference between the
important things in life, like family, love and kindness and the
unimportant things, like cars, popularity and superficiality. Are
you popular: One of the most well known of all of the social
guidance films, Are You Popular, covers everything a young adult
needs to know to be a good friend, or more importantly to be
popular. Full of stereotypes while trying to explain why conformity
is great. <b>What about prejudice?</b>: A positive film looking
toward the social benefits of keeping an open mind and embracing
all cultures, regardless of color, religion or creed. This film
encourages teens to look within themselves, as opposed to listening
to the racist teachings of society, to find the sources and reasons
behind prejudice. <b>A chance to play:</b> Recreation
opportunities, especially in the form of good public recreational
facilities, are a vital part of maintaining a healthy society,
according to this 1950 film. Giving juvenile delinquents a place to
spend their time safely and constructively is a big part of
that.</dd>

film about fitting in socially, how painful social experiences can
be as an adolescent, and all the different false stereotypes that

that she wasn't being snobbish, but rather, the social interactions
between her and others are just a little off-kilter. <b>The

make up rumors and talk smack about others in order to get ahead or

<dt><b><font color="#00CC99">[Freud, Sigmund]</font>Young Dr. Freud
(Der junge Freud)</b>(Austria | West Germany, TV, 1977)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Axel Corti. Cast: Karlheinz Hackl, Sylvia Haider,
Brigitte Swoboda, Guido Wieland. From Freud's early childhood,
where his family encounters aggressive anti-Semitism, to his
student years in Vienna, this fact based film probes deeply into
the personal and environmental influences on Freud as a young man,
which led to the development of his psychoanalytical theories. It
also explores Freud's relationships with famous colleagues, such as
Breuer and Charcot, and the growth of his first book "Studies in
hysteria". This film inverts the psychoanalytic model to place the
analyst in the place of the analysand. 98 min. <b>DVD

<dt><b><font color="#00CC99">[Jung, Carl Gustav]</font>My Name Was
Sabina Spielrein (Ich hiess Sabina Spielrein)</b> ((France |
Germany | Sweden | Denmark | Finland | Switzerland, 2002)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Elisabeth M&aacute;rton. Cast: Eva Osterberg, Lasse
Almeback, Mercedes Csampai, Palle Granditsky, Natalia Usmanova.
Featuring the voices of Maria Thorgevsky, Dan Weiner, Helmut Vogel,
and Alan Pryke. A docu-drama based on a find of letters and diaries
that revealed a love affair between Carl Jung and his first
patient, Sabina Spielrein. Her cathexis was rapid and she formed an
intense attachment to her young doctor, who seems to have
reciprocated. But after a note from Sigmund Freud on the nefarious
nature of females, the doctors hatched the theory of
counter-transference to explain their feelings. Luckily, this
wouldn't be Sabina's final contribution to psychoanalysis.
Pronounced cured, she became a psychoanalyst herself and, within
eight years, was practising alongside the founding fathers. 90 min.
