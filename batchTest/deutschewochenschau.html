After the invasion of Poland (September 1939, the outbreak of the
Second World War), the Nazis consolidated four separate newsreel
production efforts into one. These newsreels (Ufa-Tonwoche,
Deulig-Tonwoche, Tobis-Woche, Fox-T&ouml;nende Wochenschau) were
merged into a single wartime newsreel, but kept their respective
opening titles until June 1940. After that, the merger was made
public by use of a single new opening title: Die Deutsche
Wochenschau.[1] This was the sole series of German newsreels until
the end of World War II. It was a source of footage for late Nazi
propaganda films such as <i>Der Ewige Jude</i> and <i>Feldzug in
Polen</i>, as well as innumerable post-war documentaries.
