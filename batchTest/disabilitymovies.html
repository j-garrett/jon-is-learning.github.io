<dt><b>The Eye of the Beholder (aka. Private World of
Darkness)</b>(Twilight Zone, TV series, 1960)</dt>
<dd>Written by Rod Serling ; producer, Buck Houghton; director,
Douglas Heyes (Episode 42, November 11, 1960) "Janet Tyler has
undergone her eleventh treatment in an attempt to look like
everybody else. The details of the treatment are not given, but
Tyler is first shown with her head completely bandaged, so her face
cannot be seen. She is described as being "not normal" by the
nurses and doctor, whose own faces are always in shadows. The
outcome of the procedure cannot be known until the bandages are
removed. Tyler pleads with the doctor and eventually convinces him
to remove the bandages early. After a climactic buildup, the
bandages are removed, revealing to the audience that she is
beautiful. However the reaction of the doctor and nurses is
disappointment; the operation has failed, her face has undergone
"no change &#8212; no change at all". At this point, the doctor,
nurses and other people in the hospital, whose faces have never
been seen clearly before, are now revealed to be horribly deformed
in the audience's perspective, with large brows, curled lips, and
misshapen, pig-like noses. Distraught by the failure of the
procedure, Tyler runs through the hospital as the terrible faces of
everyone she runs into, apparently the norm in this society, are
revealed. Large screens throughout the hospital project an image of
the State's despotic leader (sounding and making hand motions like
Adolf Hitler), calling for greater conformity. Eventually, a
handsome man afflicted with the same "condition" arrives to take
the crying, despondent Tyler into exile to a village of her "own
kind", where her "ugliness" will not trouble the State. Before the
two leave, the man comforts Tyler with the "very, very old saying"
that "beauty is in the eye of the beholder". [<a href=

<dt><b>Million Dollar Baby</b> (2004)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Clint Eastwood. Cast: Clint Eastwood, Hillary
Swank, Morgan Freeman, Anthony Mackie. Frankie is a former boxing
manager, who initially refuses to train Maggie due to her gender
and age. With her talent and his coaching the spirited young
fighter rises through the ranks of women's boxing, the pair form a
touching bond in the process. "The film has raised a great deal of
controversy over a theme that, while a vital part of the film, has
been underplayed in its marketing campaign and carefully skirted in
reviews. At issue is the film's depiction of assisted suicide. When
the fighter portrayed by Swank receives a sucker punch in the ring,
she is paralyzed from the neck down. Unwilling to live that way,
she begs Eastwood's character to help her die, and finally, after
much soul-searching, he does." [Terri Mauro, <a href=

disability causes a loss of moral self-control," Longmore says.
This particular type has flourished through popular characters such
as Captain Hook in "Peter Pan," Mr. Potter in "It's a Wonderful

<dd>Directed by Jerry Zaks. Cast:Meryl Streep, Leonardo DiCaprio,
Diane Keaton, Robert de Niro, Hume Cronyn, Gwen Verdon, Hal
Scardino. "Estranged since their father's first stroke some 17
years earlier, Lee and Bessie lead separate lives in separate
states. Lee's son, Hank, finds himself committed to a mental
institution after setting fire to his mother's house. His younger
brother, Charlie, seems unfazed by his brother's eccentricities or
his mother's seeming disinterest. When Lee comes to the asylum to
spring Hank for a week in Florida so that he can be tested as a
possible bone marrow donor for Bessie, Hank is incredulous. "I
didn't even know you had a sister," he says. "Remember, every
Christmas, when I used to say 'Well, looks like Aunt Bessie didn't
send us a card again this year?'" "Oh yeah," Hank says. Meanwhile,
Marvin, the two women's bedridden father, has "been dying for the
past twenty years." "He's doing it real slow so I don't miss
anything," Bessie tells Dr. Wally. In Bessie's regular doctor's
absence, it has fallen to Dr. Wally to inform Bessie that she has
leukemia and will die without a bone marrow transplant. This
precipitates the two sisters uneasy reunion. In Marvin's room,
Bessie cares for her father's every need. In Lee's eyes, the
sacrifice Bessie has made is too great and realizing the old man's
welfare will fall to her if Bessie dies, Lee's first instinct is to
look for a nursing home. "In a few month's, I'll have my
cosmotology degree," she says. "My life is just coming together;
I'm not going to give it all up, now!" As first Lee is tested and
then the boys for the compatibility of their marrow with Bessie's,
the women take stock of their lives and rediscover the meaning of
"family." " [<a href=

two control-obsessed characters: Enio, a supervisor at a traffic
control operation centre and Pedro, a snooker player who seeks
absolute mastery of his technique. Both find fulfilment in life by
submerging themselves in a mathematical mindset that leads them
towards the feeling of control they long for so much. But all this
is thrown to the wind one day when both Enio's ex-wife and Pedo's
wife die in a car accident. Descending into the jagged world of his
obsessive mind, Pedro despairs until he meets Lucia, a young woman
with whom, in a parallel to his snooker techniques, he bizarrely
tries to re-live the same exact moments he once lived with his
wife. Enio on the other hand, is forced to confront his loss
through the mysterious appearance of his unknown daughter, who
forces a somewhat clumsy relationship with him by deciding to look
after him. Eventually however, the two men must decide between
their own obsessions and the new opportunities life has given
them." [<a href=

<dt><b>From the Life of the Marionettes (Ur marionetternas liv)</b>
(1980)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Ingmar Bergman. Cast: Robert Atzorn, Christine
Buchegger, Martin Benrath, Rita Russek, Lola Muethel. Peter and
Katerina seem to have a perfect marriage but beneath the facade
lies a loveless marriage. Locked in a desolate relationship, Peter
often dreams of killing his wife. His encounter with a prostitute
sparks in him an explosive rage that leads to rape and murder. In
this disturbing study of repression and obsession, Bergman
contrasts stark black and white flashbacks with vivid color images
that flood the screen with the horror of the present. "Mogens
Jensen, the psychiatrist in Mr. Bergman's film, fills his Munich
office with statues of African deities, symbols of mystery and
power, much as a tribal medicine man surrounds himself with
ritualistic totems. He wears a white coat, like the priest's robe a
vestment of authority. He is, in short, a magical god, believed by
others to be capable of dispelling evil and restoring order. But
what happens when this "god" is tested? When Peter, a friend of 20
years, confides - in the sanctity of the psychiatrist's office -
that he has recurring dreams in which he murders his wife, the
doctor makes light of an obviously grave problem. Soon it is
apparent that the doctor, who shouldn't be "treating" a friend in
the first place, has betrayed both his friendship and his
profession by attempting to seduce Peter's wife. "This comes under
professional secrecy," he cautions her, and the suggestion is that
there have been other such affairs in his office. When Peter
finally commits a murder and totally withdraws into himself, the
doctor's rationalizations show the doctor, too, to be only another
puppet overwhelmed by life's "hidden forces."" [<a href=

Featuring the voices of Maria Thorgevsky, Dan Weiner, Helmut Vogel,

that revealed a love affair between Carl Jung and his first
patient, Sabina Spielrein. Her cathexis was rapid and she formed an
intense attachment to her young doctor, who seems to have
reciprocated. But after a note from Sigmund Freud on the nefarious
nature of females, the doctors hatched the theory of
counter-transference to explain their feelings. Luckily, this
wouldn't be Sabina's final contribution to psychoanalysis.
Pronounced cured, she became a psychoanalyst herself and, within
eight years, was practising alongside the founding fathers. 90 min.

Germany, TV, 1977)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Axel Corti. Cast: Karlheinz Hackl, Sylvia Haider,
Brigitte Swoboda, Guido Wieland. From Freud's early childhood,
where his family encounters aggressive anti-Semitism, to his
student years in Vienna, this fact based film probes deeply into
the personal and environmental influences on Freud as a young man,
which led to the development of his psychoanalytical theories. It
also explores Freud's relationships with famous colleagues, such as
Breuer and Charcot, and the growth of his first book "Studies in
hysteria". This film inverts the psychoanalytic model to place the
analyst in the place of the analysand. 98 min. <b>DVD
