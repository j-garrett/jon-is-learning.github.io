<dt><b>In Search of Gandhi.</b> (Why Democracy? Series)</dt>
<dd>In the early twentieth century, Mahatma Gandhi inspired
millions of Indians to agitate for the establishment of a
democratic and free India. In 2007, India celebrated the 60th
anniversary of its existence as an independent nation. But what
kind of democracy does India have today, and what does it mean to
actually live in the world's largest democracy? Adopting the
conventions of a road-movie, the film crew travels down the famous
trail of Gandhi's salt march, stopping at the same villages and
cities where Gandhi and his followers raised their call for
independence... to document the stories of ordinary citizens in
India today and to discover the current and future state of
democracy in India. Dist. <a href=

<dt><b>India: The Untouchables: The Small Secret of India</b></dt>
<dd>Today it is illegal in India to discriminate against Dalits,
which literally means "the oppressed," the term now commonly used
to refer to India's former untouchables. Despite the legal
abolition of untouchability a half-century ago, they continue to be
the target of systematic discrimination and comprise a highly
disproportionate percentage of India's illiterate, landless and
jobless population. Dalits number 260 million Hindus, making caste
discrimination one of the world's biggest human rights issues. The
film describes several examples of caste discrimination and also
discusses the landlord-sponsored militia, Ranbir Sena's Army, which
is attacking agricultural laborers and their families, all of them
Dalits. The Ranbir Sena says the Dalits will be targets unless they
cease their agitation for better pay and land and repudiate the
Naxhalites. These are Maoist armed-activists who have gained a
following in parts of Bihar by assisting agricultural workers in
organizing and defending themselves from landlord violence.

<dd>In Nepal an ancient tradition survives to this day : young
girls are chosen to become goddesses and taken away from their
families to live in a temple where people come to worship them and
pray for good fortune. In a country where girls are seen as second

positive role model, but some are adamant that the tradition should
be stopped as the young girls miss out on their family and school
life and suffer serious psychological problems as a result. This

<dt><b>Pink Saris</b></dt>
<dd>The "Pink Gang" is a group of women who wear pink saris as a
symbol of their revolt against their society. They are victims of
domestic violence, rape and social exclusion. Their champion is
Sampat Pal Devi, who takes up their cases of social injustice,
often perpetrated by their husbands' extended families, with whom
they're forced to live. Declaring 'women have nothing but their
tears; what else do they have?', Sampat Pal has learned from
experience. Once a child-bride and a victim of abuse herself,
Sampat has no fear. She fought back and escaped the family, and now
beleaguered women from throughout Uttar Pradesh seek her out,
looking for the support and strength to do the same. Sampat Pal
laudably takes up their causes, dramatically throwing herself into
the middle of family dramas, yet for all her spirited
righteousness, she can be forced to compromise in the face of the
entrenched conventions and traditions she is railing against. A
film by Kim Longinotto with Amber Latiff and Girjashankar Vohra.

<dt><b>Shipbreakers</b></dt>
<dd>Welcome to Alang, India, the site of a gargantuan scrap yard
where ocean-going ships come to die. Forty thousand Indians live
and work here, dismembering and scavenging the hulks of 400 vessels
every year. This documentary chronicles the daily lives of the
people who work here, the barefoot men who take apart giant
mountains of steel by hand, piece by piece, as they spend months
toiling sun-up to sun-down destroying ship after ship. It is the
world's most unregulated industry. Ship owners rarely bother to
abide by the UN Base Convention, which bans shipments of
transboundary waste. One worker a day, on average, dies on the job,
from gas explosions, falls or from tons of falling steel. Still one
in four will contract cancers caused by asbestos, PCBs or other
toxic substances. Dist.: <a href=

<dt><b>The Shadow Circus: The CIA in Tibet</b></dt>
<dd>When Communist China marched into Tibet in 1949, Tibetans took
up arms against the invading forces. Unknown to most, from the
mid-1950s to 1969 the CIA armed, financed, and trained Tibetan
guerrillas in an effort to curtail the expansion of communism. This
project, code named ST Circus, was one of the CIA's longest-running
covert operations. To the dismay of Tibetan soldiers, the CIA
pulled out their support when the U.S. decided that ST Circus was
no longer in the best interest of America's political and economic
agenda. c2000. 50 min. <b>Video/C 8545</b></dd>
