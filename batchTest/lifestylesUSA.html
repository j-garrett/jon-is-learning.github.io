<dt>"The world's greatest collection of American post-modern,
nuclear family nostalgia and rampant gleeful post-war consumerism
ever compiled onto DVD! Transferred from the original films, The
series features an array of squeeky-clean, optimistic,
historically-relevant 16mm films from the 1950's and 1960's on

correct public speaking, Thanksgiving, and Formica...just to name a
few! Each 2 hour DVD comes individually packaged with full
synopsis, segment titles and commentary in the text. It's American
society as seen through the smoked-acrylic eyes of giant
corporations and --captured like a new-fangled Polaroid snapshot on
29 digitally mastered DVD's from the ORIGINAL films and negatives.
