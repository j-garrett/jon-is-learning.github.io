<dd>What happened to the peaceful ancient Pueblo civilization of
the American southwest? For 1,000 years, the Anasazi -- a
democratic people with rich achievements in architecture,
agriculture, astronomy and art -- flourished in what is now New
Mexico. Yet around 1200 A.D., something brought their utopia to a
sudden and mysterious end. Paleoanthropologist Christy Turner has
found what he believes are clear signs of cannibalism among the
Anasazi. Anthropologist Bruce Bradley demonstrates the marks left

<dt><b>Kennewick Man: An Epic Drama of the West</b></dt>
<dd>When a human skull was found by the Columbia River near
Kennewick, Washington in 1996, it turned out to be one of the
oldest and most complete skeletons ever found in North America,
igniting a firestorm of controversy pitting scientists against
Native Americans. The scientists demanded the right to study the
bones, while the Umatilla Tribe believed the bones to be sacred and
ancestral. When the American government ruled the bones would be
repatriated, eight scientists then filed a lawsuit in order to
block the action. This documentary explores the cultural
assumptions and differing opinions among the various groups
involved, looks at the far-reaching implications for the future of
anthropology and present-day relations between Native and
non-native people. 2001. 86 min. <b>Video/C 9188</b></dd>

<dt><b>The Mystery of Chaco Canyon.</b></dt>
<dd>This film examines the deep enigmas presented by the massive
prehistoric remains found in Chaco Canyon in New Mexico. The film
reveals that between 850 and 1150 AD, the Chacoan people
constructed massive ceremonial buildings in a complex celestial
pattern throughout a vast desert region. Aerial and time lapse
footage and computer modeling show how the Chacoan culture
designed, oriented and located these buildings in relationship to
the sun and moon. Pueblo Indians, descendants of the Chacoan
people, also speak of the significnce of Chaco to the Pueblo world
today. Narrator: Robert Redford. 1999. 56 min. <b>DVD 9778; vhs

<dt><b>Mystery of the First Americans</b></dt>
<dd>In 1996, near Kennewick, Washington, two college students
stumbled across a human skull and forensic anthropologists not only
identified it as Caucasian, but also discovered it is almost 10,000
years old. The discovery of the Kennewick Man, along with several
other startling finds in recent years, has embroiled scientists in
a bitter conflict with Native American groups who want the
scientific study of early Americans halted. Originally produced as

<dt><b>Myths and the Moundbuilders.</b></dt>
<dd>The huge earthworks and mounds scattered through the eastern
half of the United States prompted people in the 19th century to
speculate that a lost civilization had preceded the Indians then
living among the mounds. Though we've know for some time that the
ancestors of those Indians actually built the mounds,
archaeologists are still exploring their contents for a better
understanding of their builders. Originally broadast in 1981 as an

</dl>
<p>Native and other bodies: Addresses the track record of NAGPRA
(Native American Grave Protection and Repatriation Act) and also
looks at objects other than human remains as a kind of "cultural
body," thus looking at NAGPRA as an internally consistent
whole.</p>
<p>Native American remains and human rights: Despite the passage of
NAGPRA Native Americans are still being confronted by scientists
claiming a right to own or control dead Indian bodies in order to
conduct experiments on them perpetuating a double standard which
began with early North American exploration that treated Indian
bodies as property, curios or archaeological artificts while dead
bodies and graves of other citizens were protected by laws.</p>
<p>Human remains and NAGPRA: The chief archaeologist of the
National Park Service explains the procedures and requirements of
NAGPRA that requires the repatriation of Native American human
remains and other cultural objects in public museum collections and
those recovered from federal lands.</p>
<p>Bone courts and Native American sovereignty: Considers a

<p>Panel: Joseph Myers (Introductions), William Johnson
(Moderator), James C. Chatters, Orin Starn, Ira Jacknis, Karl
Kroeber, Karen Biestman (Discussant).</p>
<p>Kennewick Man: NAGPRA was intended to return the remains of
recent Native American dead to their nearest of kin but was not
intended to hand over ancient human fossils to modern-day Indian
tribes, yet that is how it is being interpreted by some. Much of
the scientific community and American public feels ancient remains,
which often cannot be linked to modern tribes, should not be
summarily reburied for temporal political reasons. This talk
addresses this conflict which came to a head with the case of the
Kennewick Man, a ca. 9,500 year old skeleton.</p>
<p>History and repatriation of Ishi: A small group from the Pit
River Tribe held a private ceremony last month to rebury Ishi, the
last Yahi Indian. This paper offers one view of the campaign to
repatriate Ishi and what it can tell us about anthropology, Native
America, and the politics of memory and identity.</p>
<p>From performance to record: Ishi's music and speech: Between
1911 to 1914, T. T. Waterman and Alfred Kroeber recorded Ishi, his
music and narration of stories. This talk examines the preservation
of these recordings and their content.</p>
<p>Humanity of Ishi: Historical evaluation of Ishi's behavior
challenges judgments that reduce his role to that of passive
victim. Such reduction in fact is an inverse expression of the
cliche of the "noble savage," and diminishes understanding of and
respect for the unique individuality of Ishi's impressiveness as a
human being. 153 min. <b>Video/C 7411</b></p>

toward the remains of Native Americans from the earliest European
settlement in America to the 1990's with the discovery of
"Kennewick Man" by the Columbia River in Washington, whether those
remains were located in burials or the result of death in battle.
The late 20th century movement by Indians to reclaim their
ancestors' remains succeeded to a considerable degree, but

white men were to the natives, who liked the trinkets they were
given and had no inkling what they would have to give in
return---their lands, their gods, their lives. The survivors have
been turned into exotic objects by Hollywood, television, and
tourism. As a modern-day analogue of white exploration and

these once-free peoples are restricted, either to reservations on
the poorest land in regions rich in resources or to areas
continually shrinking as roads are built and rivers channeled and
forests destroyed, they still find it difficult to believe that the
white man wants to own the land. It is a conflict that remains

Schools, where native children find it nearly impossible to balance
the white view they are taught with the language and values they
learn at home, represent a major problem for native children.
Various tribes have responded differently to the challenge of
educating their children: the Seminole of Florida resist being
integrated, the Miccosukee decided not to fight but to join, and
the Cree took back their own schools. <b>Video/C 2995</b></dd>

1300 AD, a conquering nomadic people -- who would become the Aztecs

the defeated French withdrew from the Ohio Valley and left their

Tales of tragedy and heroism unfold in segment six as Shawnee
leader Tecumseh challenged the tide of history, sparking a return
to traditional ways and seizing upon the War of 1812 as the means
to restore Indian sovereignty. In 1830 the Indian Removal Act
became law uprooting the Indians from their homes and resulting in
the sorrowful Trail of Tears. While many tribes stoically accepted
its decree others resisted. Tsali bargained his life for the fate
of his Cherokee people -- and for a Smoky Mountains homeland that

Forever".</b> This program examines the legislative attack on
native ways, including the disbanding of communal land.
Reservations were divided into 160-acre parcels that were offered
to individual Indians; the remaining vast expanses sold. In 1889,
the Oklahoma Land Rush grabbed up land that decades before was
given to the "civilized tribes" as a perpetual home. The last
pockets of resistance had been squelched: Chief Joseph of the Nez
Perce had been halted in his heroic flight for freedom, while the
Apache Geronimo became a prisoner of war. Today, the renewal of
native cultures provides a vital reminder of the glory of America's
original people and the hardships they endured. <b>Video/C

350-year conflict between European settlers and Indian natives
reached its apex with the territorial expansions of the 19th

battles and massacres that virtually wiped out the indigenous
population. This extensive documentary chronicles the Indian Wars
of 1540 to 1890 through archival photographs and voiceover
narration, covering pivotal battles such as Tippecanoe, Horseshoe

<dd><b>Tecumseh's vision</b>: Tells the story of the Shawnee leader
Tecumseh and his brother Tenskwatawa, known as the Prophet. In the
years following the American Revolution, the Prophet led a
spiritual revival movement that drew thousands of followers from
tribes across the Midwest. His brother forged a pan-Indian
political and military alliance from that movement, coming closer
than anyone since to creating an independent Indian state. <b>Trail
of tears</b>: Explores the resolve and resilience of the Cherokee
people, who resisted removal from their homelands in the Southwest
in every way they knew: assimilating, adopting an European-style
government and legal system, accepting Christianity and even taking
their case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Tecumseh's vision

of the Indian Wars, desperate times catapulted a controversial
character to the leadership of an Apache band. To angry whites,
Geronimo was an archenemy, the perpetrator of unspeakable savage

of the West but hopeful Americans moved onward toward "Manifest
Destiny", as they determined to make the West their own. Mountain
men, such as Joe Meek, found more adventure than profit as they
searched for furs. Missionaries such as Narcissa Whitman traveled

American pioneers poured west, they brought with them the nation's
oldest, most divisive issue--slavery--and the rough frontier would
supply the sparks that would ignite the Civil War. Indians would be
dragged into "the white man's war," while the besieged Mormons
would commit the worst massacre of innocent pioneers in American
history and a young writer named Sam Clemens would find adventure
in Nevada's silver camps. And as the bitter Civil War drew to a
close, celebrated Union heros such as George Armstrong Custer and
William Tecumseh Sherman would use the tactics which had defeated
the South against the Native Americans of the West. 85 min. <b>DVD

there were only a few pockets of resistance against the nation's
push to conquer the West. On the Great Plains, Sitting Bull
followed his mystical visions and urged his Lakota people to fight
rather than surrender their sacred Black Hills and traditional way
of life. Custer's "Last stand" would also become, in effect, the
last stand of the Sioux as a free people. In Utah, the Morman
patriarch Brigham Young would be forced to choose between saving
his church or sacrificing his spiritual son. Farther west, Chief
Joseph of the Nez Perce would find himself helping to lead one of
the most extraordinary military compaigns in American history. 87

American conquest of the West was nearly complete. In one decade,
with Native Americans effectively confined to reservations, some
four-and-a-half million new settlers would arrive to stake their
claim to the future. Pap Singleton, an ex-slave from Tennessee,
became the era's "Black Moses," leading his people to the free soil
of Kansas. A frail New York politician, Teddy Roosevelt,
transformed himself into a rugged North Dakota rancher, and
eventually, president of the United States. And as Americans tried
to "tame" the West, the nation's greatest showman, Buffalo Bill
Cody, instead offered adoring crowds his enthusiastic version of a
"Wild West"--heroic, glorious, romantic, and most of all, mythic.

Americans were astounded by the changes they had brought to the
West. Mining towns such as Butte, Montana were now full-fledged
industrial cities. Defeated militarily, Native Americans throughout
the region now flocked to the call of a Paiute mystic, who offered
the illusionary hope that the lost world of the buffalo could be
brought back by a Ghost Dance. But its promises would be trampled
in the snow and blood of Wounded Knee. In place of the great Native
American cultures which once dominated the Plains was a new
culture, epitomized by the Oklahoma Land Rush, in which 100,000
eager settlers lined up for a mad dash to stake out a farm and a

neared, Americans celebrated with the World Columbian Exposition,
where they were told that the frontier had closed, but in the real
West, for every frontier story that ended, another one began. Some
Native Americans waged a struggle to hold onto their traditions in
the midst of rapid, overwhelming change, while others chose to
learn the white man's ways, hoping to help their families and their
tribe. In California, the emerging metropolis of Los Angeles waged
yet another battle to control the arid region's most precious
commodity--water. Much had changed in the West, but it continued to
be what it had always been--a landscape of the imagination, the
reservoir of our shared hopes and dreams, a place of both conflict
and infinite possibility, and an enduring symbol of something
unquestionably American. 65 min. <b>DVD X1627; vhs Video/C

<dt><b>American Outrage</b></dt>
<dd>"Two feisty Western Shoshone sisters put up a heroic fight for
their land rights - and their human rights. Carrie and Mary Dann
endure terrifying roundups by armed federal marshals in which
thousands of their horses and cattle are confiscated, for the crime
of grazing them on the open range outside their private ranch -
even though that range is part of 60 million acres recognized as
Western Shoshone land by the U.S. After the government sued them
for trespassing, their dispute went to the Supreme Court, and
eventually the United Nations. Why has the U.S. spent millions
persecuting and prosecuting two elderly women grazing a few hundred
horses and cows in a desolate desert? The Dann sisters say the real
reason is the resources hidden beneath this seemingly barren land,
their Mother Earth: it is the second largest gold producing area in
the world. This eloquent testament to the courage of the Dann
sisters is an important document for those who want to understand
the ongoing resistance of Native peoples to U.S. colonialism in
Indian country." [<a href=

<dd>Filmmaker Tracey Deer uses Kahnawake, her hometown, as a lens

Aboriginal identity. Following the stories of four women, she

problem, from the advent of the highly discriminatory Indian Act
through the controversy of Bill C31, up to the present day, where
membership on the reserve is determined by a council of Mohawk
elders, whose rulings often appear inconsistent. And with her own
home as a poignant case study, she raises a difficult question
faced by people of many ethnicities across the world: What roles do
bloodline and culture play in determining identity? Written and
directed by Tracey Deer. 2007. 78 min. <b>DVD X3802</b></dd>

<dt><b>Buffalo Dance</b>(1894)</dt>
<dd>"In the year of 1872, former soldier and frontiersman "Buffalo"
Bill Cody decided to enter show business by creating a traveling
company dedicated to perform little plays based on his very own
adventures while living in the wild west. 11 years later, in 1883,
what started as a little company would become the "Buffalo Bill's
Wild West" show, an enormous spectacle conceived as a
Western-themed circus where Buffalo Bill and company would perform
many stunts or shows and bring the experience of the Wild West to
the East. Soon Buffalo Bill's show became the most popular
attraction of the 19th Century and so, in 1894, members of his show
were invited to Thomas Alva Edison's "Black Maria" in order to
participate in the making of Kinetoscope films about the show. The
legendary "Buffalo Bill's Wild West" show was now part of cinema
history. "Buffalo Dance" is one of several movies done by members
of Buffalo Bill's show in those days. What makes this one stand out
is that its one of the two (along "Sioux Ghost Dance") done about
the Native Americans of the show, as the shooting of the two films
(on September 24, 1894) represents the first time Native Americans
appeared on film. As the title implies, this movie shows three
Sioux Indians performing the "Buffalo Dance", while two others
appear in the background playing the music with their drums. The
Buffalo dance seems to be more ancient than the ritual Ghost Dance,
and this movie captures it in a very good and detailed way, making
it an invaluable source about Native Americans in that period ."

<dt><b>Sioux Ghost Dance</b>(1894)</dt>
<dd>"While much of the print of this feature has deteriorated
badly, and while the footage itself may strike many present-day
viewers as simply emphasizing stereotyped portrayals of Native
Americans, it is still of some interest as an example of early
studio practices. It was one of a number of features that the
Edison Company filmed at around the same time using performers from
the Buffalo Bill Wild West exhibition, but this one in particular
was made not for domestic viewing, but rather for European
distribution. The Edison Company was always on the lookout for
money-making and money-saving ideas, and many of their early
features were financed by potential distributors, at little or no
cost to Edison. According to film historian Charles Musser (in an
interview accompanying Kino's DVD collection of Edison films), this
particular movie was one such example, having been made as part of
promoting the Wild West's upcoming tour of Europe. The footage
itself is not especially impressive, in large part because of
damage done to the film over time. It does apparently use genuine
members of the Sioux tribe, and in viewing it, it should also be
remembered that the constraints of filming inside the Edison
Company's 'Black Maria' studio almost certainly hindered the
dancers' ability to do the dance on its usual scale. As a result,
they seem to be unnaturally scrunched together for most of the
running time. In any case, the fascination with the 'wild west',
its myths, and its figures seems to have been at least as strong in
Europe as it was in the USA, and this brief movie is one
illustration of that. It is also one of many illustrations of the
competitive business practices of the earliest film-makers - there
seems never to have been a time when movie-making was not a serious
business to some." [<a href=
