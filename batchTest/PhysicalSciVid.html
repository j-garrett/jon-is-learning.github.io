Everything</b></dt>
<dd>Examines the legendary physicist's search for the secrets of
the universe. Join Stephen Hawking and other renowned thinkers as
they explore the revolutionary new ideas that have evolved since

Topics include black holes, string theory, supersymmetry,
dimensions beyond our perception, and the mysterious M force; all
potential keys to unlocking the elusive "theory of everything" that
seems so tantalizingly close. Special features: Interviews with
Hawking, John Schwarz, Lisa Randall, Michio Kaku and more. Episode

<dt><b>Civilization and Climate</b> (<i>Climate &amp; Man</i> ;
3).</dt>
<dd>Changing climate probably played the decisive role in drawing
hominids out of the trees, up on their hind legs, and off in search
of food whose supply had been dispersed by the replacement of rain
forests by rasslands. Migrations were motivated by the search for
food; during ice ages, when sea levels dropped, new areas became
accessible and populations spread. Links between climatic changes
and emerging civilizations have also been postulated; the collapse
of civilizations confronted with climatic challenges to which they
could not or would not adapt is clearly documented. 26 min.

<dd>Featuring eyewitness testimony, takes an in-depth look at what

Louisiana coast, leading to more than a thousand deaths and
transforming a city of over one million into an uninhabitable
swamp. Combining a penetrating analysis of what went wrong with a

eyewitness testimony, investigates such questions as: What made
this storm so deadly? Will powerful hurricanes like Katrina strike
more often? How accurately did scientists predict its impact, and

Kolmogoroff (25 min.) Wolfgang Doeblin, one of the great
probabilists of the 20th century, was already widely known in the
1950s for his fundamental contributions to the theory of Markov
chains. His coupling method became a key tool in later developments
at the interface of probability and statistical mechanics. But the
full measure of his mathematical stature became apparent only in
2000 when the sealed envelope containing his construction of
diffusion processes in terms of a time change of Brownian motion
was finally opened, 60 years after it was sent to the Academy of
Sciences in Paris. This film documents scientific and human aspects

<dt><b>What Time Is It?</b></dt>
<dd>Do we really know what time it is? CERN physicist Professor
Brian Cox (and author of E=mc2) unlocks the secrets of time in this
entertaining and informative program. His journey starts with the
Sun, our historical dictator of time, but Brian discovers that the
world doesn't always spin like clockwork -- in fact, it flutters,
like an irregular heartbeat. In his search for a more reliable way
to tell the time, he experiences the physical definition of a
second with a cesium atomic clock, then jets across the Atlantic to
discover that time can speed up or slow down depending on how near
an object is to a strong gravitational field. Still looking for
answers, he consults modern ideas like string theory and quantum
mechanics that are pointing the way to future breakthroughs.
