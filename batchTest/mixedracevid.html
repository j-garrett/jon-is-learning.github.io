<dt><b>Crossing the Line</b></dt>
<dd>This documentary analyzes how mixed race comedians mediate
multiracial identities and humor. Crossing lines of racial, ethnic,
and cultural acceptability by their very existence, multiracial
comedians reveal that meanings of race vary across ethnic
combination, gender, place, and time. The film features the
experiences, perspectives, and performances of American comedians
of more than one racial ancestry. The timeliness of multiracial
comedians' roles as crossracial mediators is underscored as they
provide insight into controversies over how comedians express race
(i.e., Michael Richards' use of the N-word, Rosie O' Donnell's
slurs), and other debated meanings of race in an increasingly
diverse society. Exploring these questions exposes the very nature
of where pain and laughter come from in a racially divided world.
Special features: Disc 2, (77 min.) Special educational features:
extended interviews with Paul Spickard and Reginald Daniel;
extended comedy routines by Jim Ruel, Tessie Chua; game/interactive
class activity, Where's the line? Based on Darby Li Po Price's
Mixed laughter : mediating multiracial identities in American

<dt><b>More to the Chinese Side.</b></dt>
<dd>"I used to think that we were the typical Asian American
family," muses William Gow, a fifth-generation Chinese American of
biracial descent, as several family members describe instances of
how they are commonly mistaken for other ethnicities. Intrigued by
thesemisperceptions, Gow invites his parents and other relatives to
share their experiences and views on how they see themselves in
relation to the larger Asian American community. His Caucasian
mother and Chinese father provide insights into raising biracial
children; his Chinese cousin observes how being adopted repeatedly
throws off people's expectations of him. Interspersed with
historical details about Chinese immigration to the U.S., the
interviews warmly touch upon the complexities of a family
negotiating ethnic identities within an Asian American community
that is constantly changing. 17 min. <b>Video/C MM298</b></dd>
