                            <p>Whether you are an incoming freshman at UC Berkeley, a member of the Cal community, or an avid reader who chanced upon this page, we’re glad you’ve found your way to the archive for the annual UC Berkeley Summer Reading List for Freshmen.</p>
                            <p>For three decades now, we’ve asked folks here on campus to give us their best reading recommendations focused on a particular theme each year, and then we’ve passed that list on to the incoming undergraduate class as an early welcome to the intellectual life of the university. Nothing is required here of you incoming freshmen; these are simply lists of great reads to share and return to as the spirit moves you.</p>
                            <p>The lists—much like the UC Berkeley community—are eclectic and interesting. We hope you’ll find one, or many, readings that appeal to you.</p>

                            <p>Well, not really. However, as an incoming Cal freshman, you may be wondering what’s in store for you when classes start in the fall. We’ve got a little preview here, and a welcome to Cal, with the <strong>2015 edition of the UC Berkeley Summer Reading List for Freshmen.</strong></p>
                            <p>Is this required reading? Absolutely not. Do we hope you’ll find something on this list that appeals to you? Absolutely yes. This year’s list—“Summer Sampler:  Selections from First-Year Courses”—offers a potluck of great suggestions from a few of our many faculty who teach courses taken by freshmen. If you don’t get to one of these readings this summer, you’ll be able to find them at one of Cal’s many libraries when you arrive.</p>
                            <p>For a look at the many engaging suggestions on previous years’ lists, we encourage you to visit the <a href="#archive">Reading List archive</a>. And, of course, we encourage you to read:  avidly, widely, and wildly.</p>
                            <p>Welcome to Berkeley!</p>

                                        Reading Katherine Boo’s Pulitzer Prize winning Behind the Beautiful Forevers leaves one’s mind and heart shaken and changed. Her thick and intense description of people striving to survive a makeshift settlement in the shadow of luxury hotels near the Mumbai airport in India reads like a gripping novel that is all too real in its tale of poverty and depredation, of human frailty and strength.  On every page you’ll find the makings of a tragedy but also glimmers of possibilities for surviving tragedy. And on every page you’ll learn from Boo’s unsentimental empathy and insight how to think with respect about the hard and complex condition of life under terrible stress. You’ll leave the book equipped with her deep insights into how people survive alongside one another in an era and place of tumultuous change. And you’ll leave amazed at the writer’s commitment to getting the story right by living within it and rendering it in pitch perfect prose.

                                        In this, his second novel, PEN/Faulkner finalist and former UC Berkeley instructor T. Geronimo Johnson follows Daron Davenport and his three friends and fellow Cal students as they travel to Daron’s hometown of Braggsville, Georgia to stage a protest over a local Civil War reenactment—a protest that goes wrong in devastating ways. Woven with Greek tragedy and thick with pop culture, at once a fiercely funny satire and a moving social commentary on how it’s never simple when we talk about race and class in Bezerkeley and across the country, Welcome to Braggsville is a startling and powerful tour de force.

                                        Jar City is a detective thriller set in contemporary Iceland. The sale of the Icelandic people’s genetic information to a for-profit research company caused a controversy about the ethics surrounding privacy and health. Indridason’s first mystery novel poses the question: What would happen if a criminal abused his access to that database?

                                            In this, his second novel, PEN/Faulkner finalist and former UC Berkeley instructor T. Geronimo Johnson follows Daron Davenport and his three friends and fellow Cal students as they travel to Daron’s hometown of Braggsville, Georgia to stage a protest over a local Civil War reenactment—a protest that goes wrong in devastating ways. Woven with Greek tragedy and thick with pop culture, at once a fiercely funny satire and a moving social commentary on how it’s never simple when we talk about race and class in Bezerkeley and across the country, Welcome to Braggsville is a startling and powerful tour de force.

                                            Our department teaches introductory courses in Scandinavian culture (literature, film, art), and we welcome freshmen to join us in Scandinavian 60 (focusing on early Scandinavia -- aka Vikings) and Scandinavian 75 (modern Scandinavia).  Here are a couple of titles from our syllabi:

                                            Hrafnkel’s Saga is the medieval story of a chieftain in Viking-age Iceland who bullies all comers until he meets his match...in a lawyer. Watch for the twist at the end. Great character study and introduction to the world of the sagas in short format.

                                            This paper scares the hell out of me every time I read it! Many have suggested that the ways in which we perform and choose to publish scientific research are less than optimal. Ioannidis explores precisely what sorts of studies we ought to be suspicious of, and why, clearly and rigorously. We live in a culture that inundates us with discoveries, and this paper will help you to decide which of those discoveries are likely to be “real,” and likely to last the test of time.

                                            My student, Tien Nguyen, says: “What I like about the book The Beauty Bias by Deborah Rhode is the way Rhode covers all the social issues related to beauty and appearance in American culture. It explains the threat of widespread lookism in our society. The writing is easy to read and it is helpful to use as a reference or source for research.” I couldn't agree more with Nguyen. Indeed, Deborah Rhode provides a salient study of why looks matter and she does it in the most engaging way, blending great scholarship with keen personal observations. Truly, a must read for those who know that beauty is more than skin deep and wish to further understand how its politics prevails in every aspect of our society, including the justice system

                                            One of the things we in Statistics try to do in our lower division courses is instill in our students a healthy level of skepticism about applications of statistical methodology.  A reading that does a particularly good job of getting across the pitfalls inherent in many uses of simple statistical techniques as well as providing some success stories (such as John Snow’s classical 1855 epidemiological investigation into the causes of cholera outbreaks with its wonderful story about the removal of the handle of the Broad St pump) is this article by my late Statistics colleague David A. Freedman.

Woven with Greek tragedy and thick with pop culture, at once a fiercely funny satire and a moving social commentary on how it’s never simple when we talk about race and class in Bezerkeley and across the country, Welcome to Braggsville is a startling and powerful tour de force.
