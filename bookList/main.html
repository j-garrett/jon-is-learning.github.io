                <h3>The First Thing Freshmen Will Read</h3>
                <p>Well, not really. However, as an incoming Cal freshman or transfer student, you may be wondering what’s in store for you when classes start in the fall. We’ve got a little preview here, and a welcome to Cal, with the <strong>2015 edition of the UC Berkeley Summer Reading List for New Students.</strong></p>
                <p>Is this required reading? Absolutely not. Do we hope you’ll find something on this list that appeals to you? Absolutely yes. This year’s list—“Summer Sampler:  Selections from First-Year Courses”—offers a potluck of great suggestions from a few of our many faculty who teach these courses. If you don’t get to one of these readings this summer, you’ll be able to find them at one of Cal’s many libraries when you arrive.</p>
                <p>For a look at the many engaging suggestions on previous years’ lists, we encourage you to visit the <a href="archive.html">Reading List archive</a>. And, of course, we encourage you to read:  avidly, widely, and wildly.</p>
                <p>Welcome to Berkeley!</p>

                            <p>
                                Reading Katherine Boo’s Pulitzer Prize winning Behind the Beautiful Forevers leaves one’s mind and heart shaken and changed. Her thick and intense description of people striving to survive a makeshift settlement in the shadow of luxury hotels near the Mumbai airport in India reads like a gripping novel that is all too real in its tale of poverty and depredation, of human frailty and strength.  On every page you’ll find the makings of a tragedy but also glimmers of possibilities for surviving tragedy. And on every page you’ll learn from Boo’s unsentimental empathy and insight how to think with respect about the hard and complex condition of life under terrible stress. You’ll leave the book equipped with her deep insights into how people survive alongside one another in an era and place of tumultuous change. And you’ll leave amazed at the writer’s commitment to getting the story right by living within it and rendering it in pitch perfect prose.

                                    In this, his second novel, PEN/Faulkner finalist and former UC Berkeley instructor T. Geronimo Johnson follows Daron Davenport and his three friends and fellow Cal students as they travel to Daron’s hometown of Braggsville, Georgia to stage a protest over a local Civil War reenactment—a protest that goes wrong in devastating ways. Woven with Greek tragedy and thick with pop culture, at once a fiercely funny satire and a moving social commentary on how it’s never simple when we talk about race and class in Bezerkeley and across the country, Welcome to Braggsville is a startling and powerful tour de force.

                                <em>Jar City</em> is a detective thriller set in contemporary Iceland. The sale of the Icelandic people’s genetic information to a for-profit research company caused a controversy about the ethics surrounding privacy and health. Indridason’s first mystery novel poses the question: What would happen if a criminal abused his access to that database?

                                This paper scares the hell out of me every time I read it! Many have suggested that the ways in which we perform and choose to publish scientific research are less than optimal. Ioannidis explores precisely what sorts of studies we ought to be suspicious of, and why, clearly and rigorously. We live in a culture that inundates us with discoveries, and this paper will help you to decide which of those discoveries are likely to be “real,” and likely to last the test of time.

                                My student, Tien Nguyen, says: “What I like about the book The Beauty Bias by Deborah Rhode is the way Rhode covers all the social issues related to beauty and appearance in American culture. It explains the threat of widespread lookism in our society. The writing is easy to read and it is helpful to use as a reference or source for research.” I couldn't agree more with Nguyen. Indeed, Deborah Rhode provides a salient study of why looks matter and she does it in the most engaging way, blending great scholarship with keen personal observations. Truly, a must read for those who know that beauty is more than skin deep and wish to further understand how its politics prevails in every aspect of our society, including the justice system

                                One of the things we in Statistics try to do in our lower division courses is instill in our students a healthy level of skepticism about applications of statistical methodology.  A reading that does a particularly good job of getting across the pitfalls inherent in many uses of simple statistical techniques as well as providing some success stories (such as John Snow’s classical 1855 epidemiological investigation into the causes of cholera outbreaks with its wonderful story about the removal of the handle of the Broad St pump) is this article by my late Statistics colleague David A. Freedman.

                                Did you know that the average American will produce 102 tons of garbage in a lifetime? In addition to such information Garbology, by Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Edward Humes, contains stories of people such as Mike Speiser, aka Big Mike, who, with his 60-ton BOMAG Compactor, sculpts the 1,365-acre Puente Hills landfill into the largest active waste disposal site in the country. Humes helps us picture its size this way: “if Puente Hills were an elephant burial ground, its tonnage would represent about 15 million deceased pachyderms.” Written in a lively style, Humes conveys the complex history of garbage disposal as it developed into the highly profitable business it has become. More than a book, Garbology is a project. On <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Garbology">Garbology’s Facebook page</a> you can find updates on how various communities manage and reduce their garbage as well as ideas about how to reduce the amount of garbage you produce.

                                Brontë’s most famous novel was once required reading in high school, but now I find that only a handful of incoming students have read it, so I’ve started assigning it in my Reading & Composition courses. At once a window on British Victorian culture and a transcultural coming-of-age story, it combines all the best elements of mystery and romance with a more subtle commentary on how to establish one’s own independence and identity in a world fraught with challenges to both. It also provides a jumping-off point for thinking about the exploitation and suffering that took place in Britain's colonies, especially for women, and particularly when read together with Jean Rhys’ Wide Sargasso Sea

                                I love this book as a reader and as a teacher.  A series of four thematically linked short stories, the book provides a glimpse into bits of life in India that most of us are not familiar with. But more important, really, than the “new worlds” nature of the book, the themes of how we love or what we want out of love are wonderfully expressed.  The writing is often very beautiful and the characters breathe life: a Sikh detective trying to solve a murder; a software engineer trying to fix a bug; and the Bombay ladies-who-lunch and plot against each other, to name a few.

This is an excellent book for students at all levels including those with no background in biology or public health.

                                Are we going the way of the dinosaurs? Selected as one of The New York Times Best Books of the Year for 2014, Elizabeth Kolbert’s The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History explores this question by bringing science to life with engaging personal stories and interviews and cool biological facts. Kolbert makes very distant history fascinatingly relevant and real. Not only does Kolbert compel readers with the urgency of our situation, she also tells a story of how ideas, specifically the ideas of extinction and evolution, are born—a story of how knowledge itself, in all its messiness, is created.

                <h2>About the Summer Reading List</h2>
                <p>Since 1985, the University has offered the UC Berkeley Summer Reading List for New Students as one of the welcomes to the incoming classes of freshmen and transfer students.  Whether you’re a new student at Cal, an alum, a UC Berkeley employee, or an avid reader who’s found your way to our site (in which case, welcome!), we invite you to have a look at the <a href="index.html">current list of suggestions</a> as well as an <a href="archive.html">archive of past years’ reading lists</a>.</p>
                <p>These readings aren’t required; they’re offered for pleasure.  They’ve been suggested by Cal faculty, staff, and students as great readings that will introduce incoming students to a small slice of the intellectual life of the university and perhaps send them exploring the library’s rich collections.  Also, the readings aren’t selected by us, the list’s curators.  Instead, we ask for suggestions of great readings that would fit within a given theme, and then see what we get.  The list is always potluck, always eclectic, and always full of worthwhile readings. We feel sure you’ll find something on one of these lists that will spark your interest.</p>
                <p>We wish you good reading!</p>
