<dt><b>Anti-semitism in the 21st Century: The Resurgence</b><DD>Today, parts of the world are experiencing a dramatic resurgence of anti-Semitism--from hate propaganda to vandalism to attacks on Jews themselves. Reports from research groups indicate a major increase in anti-Semitic incidents since the year 2000, with the worldwide annual average number of major violent incidents nearly doubling from 1990s levels. It is particularly severe in Western Europe, where research shows that since the year 2000, Muslim and Arab youths were increasingly responsbile for attacks against Jews and Jewish properties. Meanwhile outside of Europe, in more and more Arab and Islamic communities around the world, there is an alarming increase in anti-Semitic rhetoric in the political and public arenas, especially in the mainstream media. What is fueling the rise in anti-Semitism in the Islamic and Arab worlds today? What real threats does it pose? And how can history help us better understand what is happening?

Part of a ten-part series that surveys historical events of the 20th century using Gaumont British newsreel footage. Covers major advances, trends, and tragedies, from political upheavals and passing social crazes to the role of technology, and examines their impacts on the future. This segment documents events from 1939-1945. World War II instigates 6 years of violence, massacres and devastation. In many countries everyday life is reduced to hunger, escape and survival. Footage focuses primarily on the homefront and the resiliency and creativity of the citizens of Europe, Russia and the U.S. in meeting the challenges and heartbreaks of war. <B>DVD X1252</B>

</p><p><DT><b>A Film Unfinished</b> <DD>At the end of WWII, 60 minutes of raw film in an East German archive was discovered.

<p><dt><b>Forgiving Dr. Mengele</b><dd>Tells the story of a shocking act of forgiveness by Auschwitz survivor Eva Mozes Kor and the firestorm of criticism it has provoked. Eva and her twin sister, Miriam, were victims of Nazi doctor Josef Mengele's cruel genetic experiments--an experience that would haunt them their entire lives. We follow Eva's metamorphosis from embittered survivor to tireless advocate for reconciliation. This unexpected transformation was sparked when Eva, in an attempt to get information about the experiments, met with another former Auschwitz doctor. Eva's ideas about justice, revenge and the possibility of healing through forgiveness--as well as the passionate opposition from other survivors--become a window to a larger discussion of the many ways people define forgiveness.

<A NAME="freefall"><p><dt><b></A>Free Fall   </b><dd>A film by   P&eacute;ter Forg&aacute;cs.

As the illusions of this   Jewish Hungarian family are eroded step-by-step, their   happy, banal moments are framed against a recitation   of anti-Jewish laws in Hungary during the Nazi era and descriptions of the deportation of Hungarian Jews.

<p><dt><b><A NAME="fuehrer">The  Fuehrer   Gives a City to the Jews </A>(F&uuml;hrer schenkt den Juden eine Stadt)</b><dd>This is the only film known to be made by the Nazis inside an operating concentration camp. This insidious propaganda film was produced in 1944 in Theresienstadt, the "model" ghetto established by the Nazis in 1941 in Terezin, a town in the former Czechoslovakia. Goebbels intended to use the film to prove to the International Red Cross and the world that Jews were being well-treated in the camps. The film is an elaborately staged hoax presenting a completely false picture of camp life. Upon completion, the director and most of the cast of prisoners were shipped to Auschwitz.

<p><dt><b>The Maelstrom: A Family Chronicle.</b> <dd>A film by P&eacute;ter Forg&aacute;cs.  Makes artful use of home movies shot in the Netherlands before and during WWII dealing with the extended Peereboom family. Information is conveyed through English subtitles and period sound, usually from radio broadcasts and a disturbing jazz score by Tibor Szemzo. What we see is a Jewish family first living unknowingly in the shadow of the Holocaust and then trying to cope with it still unaware of what it will finally mean. Shots of the family cheerfully sewing and doing preparations for a trip to a "work camp," when their destination is in reality Auschwitz, adds a devastating dimension to the understanding of Hitler's "final solution." 1997. 60 min.  <B>DVD 3215</B>

<p><dt><b>One Survivor Remembers.  </b><dd> One Survivor Remembers, the Academy Award Winner for Best Documentary Short.  What makes One Survivor Remembers memorable is its storyteller... Gerda Weissman, a Polish-born Jew who lost her entire family to the Holocaust. With grace and dignity she eloquently describes her experiences during the war and her memories of her mother, father, and brother from whom she was forcibly separated. Gerda spent three years in slave labor camps along the Polish-German border. Her parents were deported to  Auschwitz.   During the war's final stages, the Nazi's forced Gerda and 2,000 other women on a three-month death march in the dead of winter. On the eve on her 21st birthday, Weissman and 150 others who survived this ordeal were liberated by an American infantry division. Among the American soldiers was Kurt Klein, a German-born Jew who had escaped to the United States. He later became Gerda's husband. Kurt's parents also died in concentration camps. One Survivor Remembers is a testement to courage and perseverence. It offers viewers a chilling sense of the terror and devastating tragedy endured by millions who suffered at the hands of the Nazi regime, but One Survivor Remembers is also a story of hope. Now, over 50 years later, Gerda and Kurt Klein have chosen to tell their remarkable story. The documentary includes current and historical footage shot on location in Poland and the Czech republic. Today the couple lives in Arizona where they have 3 children and 8 grandchildren [from <a HREF=" http://newsworld.cbc.ca/">Newsworld</a>] Originally released in 1995. Directed by Kary Antholis.

<P><dt><b>Unwanted Cinema (Unerwunschtes Kino) </b><dd>For many Jewish filmmakers, actors, actresses, writers, directors and other creative talents, the rise of Hitler and the Nazi party first threatened their livelihoods and soon their lives. In 1934 the exclusion of Jewish filmmakers in Germany led to independent productions in Budapest and Vienna, the so-called "Unwanted Cinema" banned by the Nazis. This documentary profiles a number of Jewish artists who contributed to independent films produced in Vienna and Budapest between 1934 and 1937. The film follows them in subsequent years, as they sought refuge from the Nazi terror, both in Europe and the U.S. The film focuses on Henry Koster, Ernst Verebes, Otto Wallburg, Felix Joachimson (Jackson), Hans Jaray, Franziska Gaal, Rosy Barsony, Hortense Raky, Oskar Pilzer, and Zoltan Vidor. Featuring scenes from many films of the period, Unwanted Cinema also recounts the efforts of Hollywood producer Joseph Pasternak, who offered many of these men and women their best chance of survival.
