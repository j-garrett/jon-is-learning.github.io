<DT><B>The Overture (Hom rong)</B> (2004)<DD>Directed by Itthisoontorn Vichailak. Cast: Anuchit Saphanphong, Adul Dulyarat, Sumeth Ong-Ard, Phoovarit Phumpuang, Arratee Tanmahapran. Based on the life of Luang Pradit Pairoh (Sorn Silapabanleng) the most revered traditional Thai music master who lived during the reigns of Kings Rama V to VIII. The movie traces the life of Sorn, who picked up the ra-nad ek (Thai xylophone) mallets as a small child and played all his life. The backdrop to Sorn's life tale is the story of Thailand's classical music from its golden age during the reign of King Rama V to near extinction after the end of the absolute monarchy when the government banned it as uncivilised in the 1930s. The film shifts back and forth from the time when Sorn was a young man, playing in a xylophone duel with the intense Kun In, to the 1940s, when Thailand was under Japanese occupation and Sorn's playing would provide some inspiration to the oppressed citizenry of the time. 104 min. <B>DVD 5989</B> <dd><img SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/star.gif" border=0> <a HREF="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0415046/"> Credits and other information from the Internet Movie Database</a></p><p>
