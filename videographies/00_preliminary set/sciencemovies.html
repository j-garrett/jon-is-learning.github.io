Pat Jamieson is a scientist working on a high-altitude oxygen mask for World War II fighter pilots. He has nowhere to conduct his research until he meets Jamie Rowan, a woman with a large empty country house. She has no hopes of marrying for love but Jamie wants to help the war effort and she likes Pat, so to satisfy the proprieties they agree on a business arrangement: a marriage of convenience and partnership. They happily work on oxygen mixes instead of honeymooning. But as the footing of their relationship begins warm up, Jamie is courted by another man and the old flame that broke Pat's heart is back in his life. It will take a sleepwalking ruse, dodging in and out of doors, and a working oxygen mask to get them together again.  110 min. <b>DVD 7602</b> <dd><img SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/star.gif" border=0><a HREF="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038256/">Credits and other information from the Internet Movie Database</a></p><p>
