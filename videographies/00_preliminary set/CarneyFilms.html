<P>

<H3><font color=#99FF33>JONAS MEKAS</H3></font>

Ties in with Beat anxieties about the A-bomb and the point of work in American society. Narration by Allen Ginsberg.

<P>

<H3><font color=#99FF33>FRANK PAINE</H3></font>
<P>
<B>Motion Picture</B> (1956). Film, color, sound; 4 minutes. The energy and freedom of traveling down the road in an automobile was one of the central Beat metaphors.

<P>
<B>Portrait of Jason</B> (l967). Film, black-and-white, sound; 105 minutes. Brilliant and disturbing. Jason is the archetypal hipster of the period, the psychopath Norman Mailer's essay "The White Negro" describes, condemned to swing forever. <B>UCB   Media Ctr VIDEO/C 999:893</B>

<P>

<H3><font color=#99FF33>ANDREW MEYER</H3></font>
<P>
<B>Shades and Drumbeats</B> (1964), Film, color, silent; 25 minutes. An all-nighter of drugs and sex with a group of young people. Compare with Shadows as an evocation of the milieu.

<B>Too Late Blues</B> (1962). Film, black-and-white, sound; 103 minutes. Jazz milieu. A hero with a Peter Pan complex. Cassavetes tells the story of an artist too idealistic to function in contemporary capitalistic society. Is the problem society or him?

<P>
<B>Pull My Daisy</B> (l959). Robert Frank and Alfred Leslie. Film, black-and-white, sound; 28 minutes. One of the best-known Beat films. Although for many years mistakenly believed to be improvised, the film still stands as a paean to spontaneity and freedom.  <B>UCB   Media Ctr VIDEO/C 4336</B>
<P>
<B>Me and My Brother</B> (1965-1968). Film, black-and-white and color, sound; 91 minutes. Peter and Jules Orlovsky, Christopher Walken, Joe Chaikin, Allen Ginsberg. Raises questions about the boundaries between art and life by forcing the viewer to wonder about what in the film is acted and what is not.  <B>UCB   Media Ctr VIDEO/C 999:2156</B>


<P>
<H3><font color=#99FF33>
RON RICE</H3></font>

<P>
<B>Blonde Cobra</B> (1959-63) Film, black-and-white and color, sound with live radio; 30 minutes. Jack Smith camping it up in a work that hovers between the comic and the tragic. Where does role-playing end and reality begin?
<P>
<B>Little Stabs at Happiness</B> (l959-63). Film, color, sound; 15 minutes. The dark side of the Beat sensibility. Kerouac regarded "goofing: -clowning around-as "holy," but Jacobs wanted to restore its blasphemous potential, and does so in this film.


<P>
<H3><font color=#99FF33>JACK SMITH</H3></font>
<P>
<B>Flaming Creatures</B> (l963). Film, black-and-white, sound; 45 minutes. A Sternbergian view of life as a form of theater. Relates to the Beat interest in costume and carnival, and the attempt to treat personal identity as a work of art.   <B> Media Center  VIDEO/C 3258</B>
