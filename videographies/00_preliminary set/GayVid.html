President Bush's unequivocal opposition to gay marriage presented them with a stark choice, whether to be good Republicans and support the president, or stand up for gay rights. This decision opened schisms that threatened the unity of Log Cabin, as politics got personal and individuals were forced to decide if being gay is more important than being Republican.

<p><dt><b>Grapefruit: The Story of John and Yoko.</b><dd>Featuring an all-female cast - including Shelley Cook as Ono, Susie Bright as Lennon - this film plays with the romanticized history of the iconic Fab Four, gently mocking John and Yoko's banal squabbles and obsessive rituals of self-display. The film works on many levels to reposition the mythic tale of the Beatles boy's life by casting '80's women in mod drag, effectively mapping the lesbian sub-culture onto heterosexual mass culture. Discounting the importance of historical accuracy, Dougherty gives an incisive reading of the creation of pop culture icons with John Lennon portrayed as a projection of our society's collective needs and desires. 1989. 40 min. <B>Video 999:2003</B><p>

Gore Vidal makes an appearance and sounds a modern tone in the depths of this 40-year old stopped time piece, but his insights and observations are cut into pieces amidst much broader coverage of insistent anti-homosexual psychologists on the one hand and shadowy interviews with male homosexuals. A media history landmark produced in the same New York City that three years later saw the Stonewall riots that began the modern era of gay power activism.  1966. 44 min. <B>DVD 8569</B><p>
