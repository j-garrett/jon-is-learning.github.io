Marilyn Miller, the Marx Brothers, and Al Jolson rocketed to stardom, as songwriter teams like George and Ira Gershwin, Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle, and Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart wrote the music that seduced the nation with New York City's syncopated rhythm.

Rodgers and Hart returned to New York to create new shows, stars like Ethel Merman and Ethel Waters became top box office draws, and George Gershwin created his epic folk opera, Porgy and Bess.

But in the era of rock & roll and tumultuous social change, Broadway reinvented itself and established new traditions. The conceptual theater of John Kander & Fred Ebb's Cabaret, as directed by Hal Prince, was followed by the rock musical Hair and the urban angst of Stephen Sondheim's Company. Bob Fosse showcased sexy cynicism in Chicago, and Michael Bennett created the blockbuster A chorus line.

Julie Taymor re-imagined Disney's The lion king, composer Jonathan Larson scored a bittersweet triumph with Rent, and the old-fashioned musical was reborn in Mel Brooks' The Producers. The creation of Wicked, the biggest hit of 2004, highlights the challenges of producing on Broadway in the 21st century. <B>DVD 3079</B>
