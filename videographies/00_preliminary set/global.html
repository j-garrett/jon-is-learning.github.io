Makes a compelling case for the forgiveness of foreign loans accrued by some of history's worst dictators, debts that exacerbate the suffering of the victims of the dictators and the institutions that profited from their rule.

<dt><b>The Digital Dump: Exporting Re-use and Abuse to Africa</b><DD>Exposes the ugly underbelly of what is thought to be an escalating global trade in toxic, obsolete, discarded computers and other e-scrap collected in North America and Europe and sent to developing countries by waste brokers and so-called recyclers. In Lagos, while there is a legitimate robust market and ability to repair and refurbish old electronic equipment including computers, monitors, TVs and cell phones, the local experts complain that of the estimated 500 40-foot containers shipped to Lagos each month, as much as 75% of the imports are "junk" and are not economically repairable or marketable. Consequently, this e-waste, which is legally a hazardous waste is being discarded and routinely burned in what the environmentalists call yet "another" cyber-age nightmare now landing on the shores of developing countries. 2004.  23 min.<B> DVD 8252</B>

<p><dt><b>Elite Globalization vs People's Globalization</b><dd>Kevin Danaher speaks of two types of globalization. Elite globalization features money values, violence, and the "God is on our side" mentality. It is driven by big corporations seeking to maximize their profits at the expense of human needs. People's globalization is a grassroots movement espousing life values, non-violence, and a "God doesn't take sides" view. This type of globalization is exemplified by fair trade, ecology concerns and micro-lending networks. Danaher explains why, since 9/11, it is important to pursue the grassroots people's globalization path.  Recorded on December 4, 2001 in Packard Hall, on the Colorado College campus, in Colorado Springs, Colorado. 75 min.

The people of Makoko appear to have a choice: Children can go to the free state school, or they can pay at one of a growing number of small, private schools that have opened there. Research into how and why these private schools have emerged in such unlikely circumstances has been organized by a team from the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Their research reveals that in communities like Makoko, parents are voting with their feet. They think the state system has failed, and a new and interesting grass roots movement in education seems to be the result.  Produced and directed by Dick Bower. 23 min. <B>DVD 8386</B>

Forensic scientists are still uncovering the truth about what really happened at Srebrenica. The perpetrators of the massacre went to enormous lengths to hide the evidence; former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military subordinate General Ratko Mladic - both indicted for war crimes - have evaded capture for ten years. But there is now a bigger political process at work as all sides try to move towards a better and more secure future for the Balkans. One reason for this new determination is the prospect of the Balkan States joining the EU.  Narrator/director, Amanda Feldon. 2005.  23 min. <B>DVD 8387</B>

But ministers in the present government admit that corruption hasn't been entirely wiped out. HIV/AIDS has made matters much worse. International donors are giving over 200 million dollars for AIDS programs every year, but many Kenyans believe that these vital funds are not getting through. The price of the government's apparent unwillingness to tackle corrupt officials has been that donor funding for Kenya is scaled back. And yet at the same time Kenya's government is calling for debt relief on its $600 million annual debt repayments.  Filmed & directed by Rob Sullivan. 27 min. <B>DVD 8388</B>

One widely quoted source says almost two thousand nurses left the country between 1995 and 2002. The exodus is set to continue as nurses opt to leave a crumbling health system to earn more abroad. In the UK, some nurses can earn more in a day than they could in a month back home. Spending on health in Ghana has gone up but its value has declined because of inflation. While most of that money goes to wages, patients have to pay because the health service operates on a "user pays" principle, the so-called "cash and carry" system. The stresses of this system is one reason health workers leave.  Filmed & directed by Kim Hopkins.  26 min. <B>DVD 8389</B>

Over 40% of the Zambian government's budget comes from foreign donors. In 2003 that was $560 million. While the EU prefers to channel most of its aid through the government, the US and the Japanese still fund individual projects, such as the building of a new school which is being completed by a Japanese contractor. There are many individual NGOs in Zambia involved in local projects, independent from government and funded directly by international donors. But now the government is arguing that it should be in control of dispersing all international development aid. The days of individual donors funding individual projects could be a thing of the past.  Filmed & directed by Ben Summers.  26 min. <B> DVD 8390</B>

In his election speech, he promised to improve education, to improve health, to make land ownership fairer and - most importantly - to fight poverty. But Brazil's business community believes rapid growth is what is needed to improve the country's economy and combat social inequality.

A landlocked former French colony of just under four million people, the Central African Republic is one of the least developed countries in the world but appeals for aid have fallen largely on deaf ears. Only a handful of aid agencies continue to work there, and the amount of aid it gets is pitiful compared to other sub-Saharan countries. In 2003, it received just $12.9 USD per person. President Francois Bozize confirms that health is the country's top priority.

Said argues that collapsing complex, diverse and contradictory groups of people into vast, simplistic abstractions has disastrous consequences. Presenting instead a vision of the "coexistence" of difference, Said concludes with the fundamental challenge that faces humanity at the turn of the millennium. 1998. 55 min. <B>Video/C 5801</B><p>

<p>
 



<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>The Food Machine.</b> Discusses the farm crisis in the United States in which small farms are being bought by large corporations. This pattern has been transplanted to underdeveloped countries, such as the Sudan resulting in increased food costs and a destabilizing of the rural population. Video/C 5935.

<p>
<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>The Avoidable Famine.</b> Examines the impact of changes in traditional farming methods on the economy of Sudan. When the Sudan was a colony of Great Britain, the best farm land was used to grow cotton but a drop in cotton prices in the 1970's dictated a return to traditional food crops, which made the Sudan self-sufficient in food. Then the International Monetary Fund insisted that the nation return to growing cotton as a condition for making loans to the Sudan. Cotton prices remained low and the nation was forced to import grain from the  U.S.--thus pushing the Sudan deeper into debt while  the people starved. Video/C 5936.
 <p>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Sharing the Land.</b> Discusses the costs of rapid industrial expansion in Brazil and the need for land reform. Brazil's "economic miracle" of the 1970's was supposed to "trickle down" to the poorest segments of the population but only the top 10% of the population  benefitted from the economic policy, while the gap between rich and poor grew. The resulting huge debt has caused an even greater emphasis on the export of food, causing shortages and higher prices in Brazil. Video/C 5937.










<p>
<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>The Hunger Business.</b> Film examines how the international trade of agricultural products effects underdeveloped nations. The U.S., as the world's dominant producer of cerealgrains, is an important player in the global trade of food. Grain exports are seen in the U.S. as a good way of eliminating agricultural surpluses but food aid can prevent poor nations from becoming self-sufficient because the government of those nations has no incentive to develop policies to increase food production. Video/C 5938
<p>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>A Question of Aid.</b>  Discusses the different approaches to the problem of hunger in Kerala, india and Bangladesh. In Kerala government-run "fair price shops" assure that every person can afford basic nutrition and government developed programs assure high standards of health, education and birth control. Bangladesh, however, is heavily dependent on foreign aid, most of which is used to support the urban middle class while the rural poor remain malnourished, uneducated and trapped in a cycle of poverty.

Summary 	Though over 120 countries voted to create the International Criminal Court (ICC), some of the most powerful nations in the world - China, Russia, and the United States - refused to ratify it, the U.S. claiming, among other things, that the ICC's authority to second-guess the actions taken and the results reached by participating states was an infringement on national sovereignty. Nevertheless, prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo issues arrest warrants for the rebel leaders of the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda, puts four Congolese warlords on trial in The Hague, charges the president of Sudan with genocide and war crimes in Darfur, challenges the UN Security Council to have him arrested, and shakes up the Colombian criminal justice system.

It also examines how an overabundance of food -- in the form of over-consumption -- is causing an epidemic of obesity that is spreading across the globe.

<B>How Safe Are We?</B> Despite the rise in life expectancy in the past 100 years, in the last few decades, thirty new infectious diseases have emerged and one of them -- AIDS -- is becoming perhaps the most devastating epidemic in history. New diseases travel the globe with unprecedented rapidity. This segment examines the most critical threats we face today -- including avian flu -- and the pressing need to strengthen global public health systems.

During the 1990s, non-governmental organizations such as the World Food Program distributed seeds and farm tools to the poor, and the government allowed them to live and farm on public land. The program's subsidies supported the farmers during poor growing seasons. The World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund have forced the Malawi government to stop the subsidies, starving millions. AIDS is so pervasive in Malawi that many widows prefer starvation for themselves and their families to seeking a new mate.

<p> Reflections on pain and memories: Addresses memories that follow torture: experiences of grief, anger, and fragmentation of identity and the healing process necessary to regain wholeness. Recovery depends on working through the pain and memories in different levels and putting words to them.





<p>Tortured bodies without ancestors: Examines some of the ways terror and torture in South Africa resulted inthe death of the African family through an attack on traditional law and examines what occurs when the body is subjected to torture.

<p>Healing the individual, family and communities after thewar: Analyzes the use of deliberate terror inflicted upon the populace during the Yugoslav War. The emphasis is on how the destruction of communities and individuals is linked to manipulation and creation of powerlessness. The ethnic cleansing and war-rape were carefully designed to create terror among civilians and create millions of refugees.

<p> Native and other bodies: Addresses the track record of NAGPRA (Native American Grave Protection and Repatriation Act) and also looks at objects other than human remains as a kind of "cultural body," thus  looking at NAGPRA as an internally consistent whole.








<p>Native American remains and human rights: Despite the passage of NAGPRA Native Americans are still being confronted by scientists claiming a right to own or control dead Indian bodies in order to conduct experiments on them perpetuating a double standard which began with early North American exploration that treated Indian bodies as property, curios or archaeological artifacts while dead bodies and gravesof other citizens were protected by laws.

<p> Human remains and NAGPRA: The chief archaeologist of the National Park Service explains the procedures and requirements of NAGPRA that requires the repatriation of Native American human remains and other cultural objects in public museum collections and those recovered from federal lands.

<p> Bone courts and Native American sovereignty: Considers aproposal to establish a Bone Court -- a new federal judicial forum to hear and decide disputes over museum collections of human remains, repatriation, burial sites, research on bones and to protect native sovereignty. 180 min.

Chatters -- History and repatriation of Ishi/ Orin Starn -- From performance to record: Ishi's music and speech / Irfa Jhacknis -- The humanity of Ishi / Karl Kroeber.

<p>Panel: Joseph Myers (Introductions), William Johnson(Moderator), James C. Chatters, Orin Starn, Ira Jacknis, Karl Kroeber, Karen Biestman (Discussant).







<p>Kennewick Man: NAGPRA was intended to return the remains of recent Native American dead to their nearest of kin but was not intended to hand over ancient human ossils to modern-day Indian tribes, yet that is howit is being interpreted by some. Much of the scientific community and American public feels ancient remains, which often cannot be linked to modern tribes, should not be summarily reburied for temporal political reasons. This talk addresses this conflict which came to a head with the case of the Kennewick Man, a ca. 9,500 year old skeleton.

<p>   History and repatriation of Ishi: A small group from thePit River Tribe held a private ceremony last month to rebury Ishi, the last Yahi Indian. This paper offers one view of the campaign to repatriate Ishi and what it can tell us about anthropology, Native America, andthe politics of memory and identity.

<p> From performance to record: Ishi's music and speech: Between 1911 to 1914, T. T. Waterman and Alfred  Kroeber recorded Ishi, his music and narration of stories. This talk examines the preservation of these recordings and their content.




<p>  Humanity of Ishi: Historical evaluation of Ishi'sbehavior challenges judgments that reduce his role tothat of passive victim. Such reduction in fact is aninverse expression of the cliche of the "noble savage," and diminishes understanding of and respect for theunique individuality of Ishi's impressiveness as ahuman being.

<p> Panel: Nancy Scheper-Hughes (Introduction), Ruth Richardson, Margaret Lock, Lesley Sharp, Alan Shewmon, Laura Nader (Discussant).

<p> Corpses for dissection, organs for transplant: Considers the current world organ shortage in a long historical perspective and compares the procurement histories oforgans for transplant and corpses for dissection drawing disquieting parallels between them.  <p> On being good-as-dead in a world short of organs: Examines the concept of brain death and its viability as a diagnostic tool of "death," since new medical technologies have kept bodies "alive" for more than ayear after brain death has occurred. Increasing world-wide demand for organs for transplant and thedebate about giving legal recognition to "social death," highlights the urgency to clarify the way in which medical and bioethical professionals define death.







<p> Who owns the donor body?: In the past donor's identities have been anonymous but recently donor kin have asserted their rights to proclaim publicly the personal identities of organ donors through new memorial forms that circumvent professional  involvement. This talk explores the conflicts that arise as lay versus professional parties assert competing claims upon the donor body and its parts and the means by which the former now circumvent the obstructionist strategies of the latter.  <p> The Brain and human death: Widespread confusion surrounds both the precise signification of "brain death," and the rationale for its purported equivalence with death. Here a neurologist reconsiders whether "brain death" is any longer conceptually viable or even pragmatically necessary.  184 min.  Video/C 7412

 <p> Panel: Guy Micco (moderator), Lawrence Cohen, Michael M.Friedlaender, Nancy Scheper-Hughes, Rosemary Thandiwe Sitsheshe, Linda Johnson, Lilian Goffi.



<p>Medical triangle: Reviews the history and sociology of organ procurement and  transplantation in India focusing on the origins of the market in kidneys, the emergence of marked regions of kidney sales, the role of private hospitals and their funding, of politicians and bureaucrats and foreign agents of various sorts.






<p>Right to sell a kidney: A kidney transplant clinic in Jerusalem has been treating Arab and Israeli patients returning after buying kidneys abroad. These transplants, which are illegal in Israel, are discussed making a strong case for both the legalization of remuneration for kidney donation and also for strengthening the restraints on illegal transactions.     

<p> Body and commodity fetishism: The global traffic inhuman organs, tissues and body parts -- from the living as well as from the dead -- is examined as an anthropological analysis of postmodern forms of human sacrifice disguised as a "donation," rendered invisible by its anonymity, and hidden under the medical rhetoric of "life saving" and "gift giving.".

<p>  Human rights violations at the Cape Town police mortuary: A loophole in the South African Organ and Tissue Act has allowed some doctors to harvest tissues and organs without considering feelings of the next of kin, justifying their actions as motivated by the altruistic desire to "save lives.".<p>Personal accounts of organs and tissue theft: Recounts the experiences of an American wife who donated her husband's organs upon physician's request to discover later that they have been sold by "body brokers" in Germany.
