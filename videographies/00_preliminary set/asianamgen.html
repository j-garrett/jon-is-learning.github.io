	Volume 2 : Some questions for 28 kisses : confronts the viewer with images of Asian female/non-Asian male pairings in American movies and mass media, examining topics such as interracial dating, ethnic fetishes and race identity; Asian studs nightmare : a wacky spoof on the racial politics operating behind a hit television dating show; Sweet or spicy? : in the context of a telephone dating service, examines dating relationships for men of mixed Asian / white descent and probes Asian American male sexuality in popular culture; Sex, love & Kung Fu : a comical look at two crazed kung fu fanatics who argue over Asian American masculinity and the nature of martial arts films; L.A.
