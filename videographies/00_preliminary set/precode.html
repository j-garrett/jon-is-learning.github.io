"The "pre-Code era" refers to a roughly five-year period in film history, beginning with the widespread adoption of sound in 1929 and ending on July 1, 1934, with the inauguration of the Production Code Administration and a policy of rigid censorship. Before July 1, 1934, restrictions on movie content varied widely, depending on local laws, mores and public taste. As a result, "pre-Code films" tend to be racier, sexier, more adult, more cynical, more socially critical, more honest and more politically strident than the films produced by Hollywood on up through the early 1960s." [Mick LaSalle.  From:  <A HREF="http://www.greencine.com/static/primers/precode.jsp">GreenCine</A>]

<DT><B>American Madness</B> (1932)<DD>Directed by Frank Capra. Cast: Walter Huston, Pat O'Brien, Kay Johnson, Gavin Gordon, Constance Cummings.
During the height of the Great Depression a populist bank president, ruined by an unscrupulous bank officer who orchestrates a robbery of the bank to clear his huge gambling debts, is saved from financial ruin by his small depositors. A  notable example of the type of "social problem film" that would later either be disallowed or sugar-coated under the Production Code.  
<P>
"According to information in the MPAA/PCA Collection at the AMPAS Library, American Madness was initially rejected by the Ohio state censor board, but was later approved for showing if the scenes of people mobbing the bank and demanding their money were deleted. In a 25 Mar 1932 letter to Will H. Hays, the head of the MPPDA, Colonel Jason S. Joy, who was the Director of the Studio Relations Department of the AMPP, made a comment concerning an early script for American Madness and other proposed stories dealing with banks: "The bank stories I think are all right from a policy standpoint and will even do good by helping renew confidence in banking institutions. In fact one of them, a Columbia story tentatively called FAITH ought to be seen by all the bankers themselves for, in script-form at least, it is a strong preachment of principles I know you thoroughly believe in, namely enough confidence by bankers in human nature to allow them to take leadership and help cure these screwy times." After the film was released, A. H. Giannini wrote to Harry Cohn and stated: "I believe that this photoplay, which should be exploited by the leading theatres of this country, will do more than any other single agency to stop runs on banks which are started by false or malicious rumors." Joy sent this letter to various censor boards and exhibitors to advertise the film."

<DT><B>Baby Face</B> (1933)<DD>Directed by Alfred E. Green. Cast: Barbara Stanwyck, George Brent, Donald Cook, Alphonse Ethier, Henry Kolker, Theresa Harris, Margaret Lindsay, Arthur Hohl, John Wayne.  It's the age-old story of the girl so mistreated by men that she's determined to get revenge. Lilly (Baby Face) sleeps her way from basement speakeasy bartender, literally floor by floor, to the top floor of a New York office building. Bank submanager Jimmy McCoy finds her a job in the bank only to be cast aside as she hooks up with the bank's president. "The Hays office recommended that the picture be pulled from the theaters for its violations of the production code. ...There was extensive correspondence between officials of the AMPP and Warner Bros. executives Darryl Zanuck and Jack L. Warner regarding various changes which were intended to make the film more acceptable to censor boards across the country. The main thrust of the changes was to attach an ending which showed Lily losing everything she had gained and returning to her hometown in order that viewers would not be tempted to believe that vice was rewarded. Originally the character of the cobbler professed a Nietzchian philosophy which was unacceptable under the production code. The character was changed to become instead the moral voice of the film, and was used to indicate that the character of Lily had been wrong to advance in the by using her body. Also cut were the most blantant references to the fact that Lily was being kept by men."

 <P><dt><b>Bad Girl</b>(1931)<dd>Directed by Frank Borzage.  Cast: 	James Dunn, Sally Eilers, Minna Gombell, Frank Darien. 
Dorothy Haley, a dress model, meets Eddie, a radio repairman, and is intrigued when he doesn't immediately fall in love with her like all other men. Eventually, after a rocky courtship, they marry and when they discover a baby is on the way Eddie takes on all sorts of extra jobs to pay for a pricey obstetrician, even moonlighting as a prizefighter.  Based on the novel by Vi&ntilde;a Delmar.  

"The file for Bad Girl in the MPAA/PCA Collection at the AMPAS Library contains an evaluation of the novel on which the film is based, dated 16 Nov 1928, by Hays Office official Lamar Trotti, who said: "'Bad Girl' might be produced as a sex hygiene picture called 'Motherhood.' It is simply the story of girl who is 'bad' for one night, marries the boy the next day, and then has a baby." Trotti called the novel a "nauseating story of doctors, illnesses, etc." and said that the book "disgusted" him and was "cheap and shoddy writing about cheap and shoddy people.""

"Betty Boop is known as the first and one of the most famous sex symbols on the animated screen;[1][2] she was a symbol of the Depression era, a reminder of the more carefree days of Jazz Age flappers. Her popularity was drawn largely from adult audiences, and the cartoons, while seemingly surrealistic, contained many sexual/psychological elements, particularly in the "Talkartoon", Minnie the Moocher, featuring Cab Calloway and his orchestra. Minnie the Moocher is perhaps the one cartoon that defined Betty's character as a teenager of a modern era at odds with the old world ways of her parents."  [<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Boop">Wikipedia</A>] The first seven cartoons in this collection were released before the Hays Code was enacted and the final group features performances by Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway, Rudy Vallee and Ethel Merman. Contents: Pre-code: Boop-oop-a-doop -- S.O.S. -- Chess-nuts -- A-hunting we will go -- Betty Boop's busy bee -- Betty Boop's bamboo isle -- Betty Boop for President. -- Jazzy guest stars: Minnie the Moocher -- I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal you -- Snow-White -- The old man of the mountain -- Kitty from Kansas City -- Rudy Vallee melodies -- You try somebody else. 108 min. <B>vhs 999:2150</B>

Although various state censorship boards objected to some of the dancing scenes, only British Columbia objected to the closeups of Dolores Del Rio swimming half-naked underwater.

<P><dt><b>Bitter Tea of General Yen</b>(1932)<dd>Directed by Frank Capra. Cast: Barbara Stanwyck, Nils Asther, Toshia Mori, Walter  Connolly, Lucien Littlefield, Richard Loo, Helen Jerome Eddy.  An American missionary, Megan Davis, in attempting to rescue children from the brutality of China's Civil War, gets rescued/kidnapped by General Yen, a power  hungry Chinese warlord. Eastern and Western philosophies collide, as do the characters. Megan  wants to return to her fiance in Shanghai, but could it be that in spite of General Yen's heartless brutality, she's falling in love with him? A moody, beautifully atomospheric, sensitively performed film of a tragic tale of unrequited love. "The Hays Office...received complaints from unnamed sources about the portrayal of missionaries in the film. In a 1950 memo to PCA Director Joseph I. Breen, PCA staff members advised that "it would be well if the company [Columbia] would drop its plans to reissue this picture." The memo stated: "Probably the most objectionable characterization is that of the American financial advisor to the General, played by Walter Connolly. He is a completely unscrupulous character without morals or ethics. This does not seem to be a good portrayal of an American in the Orient to be circulated at this time." The staff members also objected to the portrayal of the missionaries, stating that they were "shown to be somewhat silly and ineffectual," and asserted that there was "a very questionable element of the heroine offering herself sexually to the General.""

</p><p><dt><b>Blonde Venus</b>   (1932)<dd>Directed by Josef von Sternberg. Cast: Marlene Dietrich, Herbert Marshall, Cary Grant, Hattie McDaniel.
The story of a woman who is torn between two men, her successful stage career and her child. Helen Faraday is a nightclub singer turned housewife, but when her husband needs money to have a life-saving operation, she decides to resume her career as a singer to raise money. She undergoes a chain of events that separate her from her husband and force her to make a choice between her lucrative singing career, and her role as a wife and mother.  "Herbert Marshall's glimpse of Marlene Dietrich's skinny-dip leads to marriage and toddler Dickie Moore, their happiness derailed when she must hit the streets to pay for hubbie?s radium poisoning treatments. The most outlandish of the Dietrich/von Sternberg pictures, highlighted by her gorilla-suited  "Hot Voodoo" number, plus a lucrative affair with young Cary Grant."

<P><DT><B>Born to Be Bad</B>(1934)<DD>Directed by Lowell Sherman. Cast: Cary Grant, Loretta Young, Marion Burns, Henry Travers.
"Letty, a young woman who ended up pregnant, unmarried and on the streets at fifteen is bitter and determined that her child will not grow up to be taken advantage of. Letty teaches her child to lie, steal, cheat and anything else he'll need to be street smart. We meet Letty when Mickey is 7-1/2. Mal enters the picture when his truck and Mickey, who is hanging on to the back of a delivery truck and being pulled along the streets on his roller skates, collide. Mickey is not injured badly, but when Letty discovers that Mal is rich, she concocts a scheme to take Mal to the cleaners. When her plot is uncovered, Letty is also discovered for the unfit parent that she is, and Mickey is taken away from her. Mal and his wife Alice, unable to have children of their own, take Mickey in and give him a father's love, a true mother's love, and a home he can call his own. Letty is jealous of Mickey's growing attachment to these two good people and she still sees Mal as a ticket to riches. Letty seduces Mal, records the seduction and then plans to blackmail Mal. Her plans are upset when Mal immediately tells his wife, and Alice accepts the relationship. Letty learns a painful lesson in selfless love and finally sees that what is best for Mickey is more important than her own plans."

"Former "It" Girl Clara Bow blazed her way into the 1930's with this scorching cautionary tale about a Texas

One of the most beloved films of pre-Code aficionados, Call Her Savage features a fascinating Hollywood recreation of a Greenwich Village cabaret, complete with a pair of mincing pansies and a slumming expedition. A subversive and wickedly entertaining film." [<A HREF="http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2008janfeb/precode.html">Harvard Film Archive</A>]  82 min.  <b> DVD X2183</b>

Drama about a self- centered, materialistic woman whose stockbroker husband (Brent) loses his fortune. "Pre-Hays Code films continue to surprise and delight with their mature and downright honest depiction of relationships. The treatment of the frailty and shortcomings of married partners (admittedly the stinking rich where infidelity can be explored at one remove and is par for the course) and their romantic entanglements is refreshingly frank. Affairs are tolerated and freely admitted to and the erring partners are not unduly punished but do go through a redemption nevertheless."

<p><dt> <B>Ecstasy (Ekstase)</B>(Czechoslovakia  / Austria, 1933)<DD>Directed by Gustav Machat&yacute;.   Cast: 	Hedy Lamarr, Aribert Moog, Leopold Kramer, Jaromir Rogoz.  	Eva has just gotten married to an older gentleman, but discovers that he is obsessed with order in his life and doesn't have much room for passion. She becomes despondent and leaves him, returning to her father's house. One day while bathing in the lake she meets a young man and they fall in love. The husband has become grief stricken at the loss of his young bride, and fate brings him together with the young lover that has taken Eva from him. The film was highly controversial in its time largely because of a nude swimming scene. It is also perhaps the first non-pornographic movie to portray sexual intercourse, although never showing more than the actors' faces. It has also been called the first on-screen depiction of a female orgasm.  Based on a story by Samuel Cummins 79 min. <B> 	 DVD X781; vhs 999:287 </B>

<p><dt> <B>Female </B>(1933)<DD>Directed by Michael Curtiz.  Cast: Ruth Chatterton, George Brent, Lois Wilson, Johnny Mack Brown, Ruth Donnelly.  In director Michael Curtiz's romantic comedy Female, Ruth Chatterton plays Alison Drake, the iron-fisted president of a motorcar company. Alison oversees the daily operations of her male employees with a predatory gaze and frequently exercises her right to engage with them in any way she deems fit. She meets her match in an equally strong-minded new employee, Jim Thorne (George Brent), and the two engage in a smoldering, contentious, sexually charged duel. The action of the film--one of the first to depict a female character turning a man's world to her advantage--feeds on the novelty of presenting a woman as a corporate shark and bedroom hound. Though it's obvious the filmmakers thought they were creating a scenario that would never actually happen, Alison's world-smashing exploits make the bulk of the film (before she begins to question her nontraditional lifestyle) a protofeminist romp. Brent and Chatterton were married at the time they made the film, and the natural chemistry between them is abundantly evident. Curtiz packs the screen with extravagant set design and period detail. 60 min. <B>DVD 9397 </B>

<P><dt><b>Flying Down to Rio</b> (1933)<dd>Directed by Thornton Freeland. Cast: Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Delores Del Rio, Gene Raymond, Raul Roulien.  This film, containing the first of many Fred Astaire - Ginger Rogers partnerships, concerns a troupe of entertainers stranded in Rio. "Racy songs & racier dance numbers, gratuitous dressing scenes, and double-entendre dialogue. Franklin Pangbourne gets plenty of screen-time for a lengthy "sissy" portrayal impossible in the code era. Stereotyped portrayals of blacks and Latinos are tossed - the code era saw all racial stereotypes strictly adhered to."  Songs include "The Carioca," "Orchids in the Moonlight," and the title song. Notable for a brilliantly photographed finale with chorus girls on the wings of flying airplanes, the movie was the musical that broke with the rather contrived Busby Berkeley productions and moved toward a closer integration of musical and narrative elements. Astaire's dance numbers come not as interruptions but as extensions of the plot.  Special features: Vintage comedy short: Beer and pretzels with Ted Healy and his Stooges; Classic cartoon: I like mountain music  89 min. <b>DVD 6713</b>

<p><dt><b>Footlight Parade</b> (1933)<dd>Directed by Lloyd Bacon. Cast: James Cagney, Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler, Dick Powell, Frank McHugh, Ruth Donnelly, Guy Kibbee, Hugh Herbert.  A determined producer of cine-variety numbers  gets the show going despite great difficulty. Complete with showstopping  Busby Berkeley production numbers, choreographed with the colossal imagination and scope that have become Berkeley's legendary trademark, including the classic "human waterfall" number that displays chorus girls costumed  in ropes of pearls and showered in a colored mist from 300 tiny water sprays. Features an opium den scene ("Shaghai Lil") and other risque, pre-code bits. "One character in the film, played by actor Hugh Herbert, is the brother of the one of Kent's partner's wife, who forces her husband to hire her relatives. Herbert acts as the censor for Kent's productions, constantly telling Kent certain parts of his production numbers have to be changed. His character is portrayed as buffoonish and comical, saying disagreeable lines to Kent such as "You must put brassieres on those dolls..." (referring to actual dolls) "...uh huh, you know Connecticut." This character foreshadows the coming Production Code, which was in full force less than a year later."

<P><dt><b>Frankenstein  </b> (1931)<dd>Directed by James Whale. Cast:  Boris Karloff, Colin Clive, Mae Clark, John Boles, Edward Van Sloan.  An adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel about the scientist who creates a terrifying monster. Dr. Frankenstein dares to tamper with life and death by creating a human monster in his laboratory, but his dreams of perfection are thwarted when the monster becomes an uncontrollable beast.  "Jason Joy (Production Code enforcer) wrote to Will Hays:  'Frankenstein is staying for four weeks and taking in big money at theatres which were about on the rocks . . . resentment is surely being built up. How could it be otherwise if children go to these pictures and have the jitters, followed by nightmares? I, for one, would hate to have my children see FRANKENSTEIN, JEKYLL, or the others and you probably feel the same way about Bill [Will Hays, Jr.]. Not only is there a future economic consideration, but maybe there is a real moral responsibility involved to which I wonder if we as individuals ought to lend our support.'"

"Unsatisfied with status quo politics, filmmakers looked to authoritarian leadership on the left and the right for possible solutions. Dubbed by the trade press as the "dictator craze," these films presented "strong tyrannical personalities who, whatever their flaws as human beings and citizens, at least knew how to take strong action" ... Movies allowed Americans to fantasize about embracing revolutionary leadership, whether left or right, that could take the nation out of hard times. Inspired by events such as the government's brutal attack of peaceful Bonus Army marchers in July 1932, films like The Power and the Glory (1933) and Gabriel Over the White House (1933) dealt with strikes, massive gatherings of the unemployed, massacres by private police or government forces, and dictators who presided over these events, allegedly for the benefit of the nation."

Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler play two young hopefuls struggling to make it on Broadway. Even falling in love has its hardships, as Powell's high-brow Eastern family is determined to break them (and the show) up. More complications set in when his brother falls for Keeler's wise-cracking roommate. "For "Petting in the Park [musical number]," Dick Powell led the male chorus in a risque come-on to the female chorus on an elaborate Central Park set. The number takes a risque turn when the women get caught in a rainstorm and retreat behind a flimsy screen to remove their wet clothes (these were the days before Hollywood censored itself). They re-emerge in metal costumes designed to hold the men at bay -- until a lecherous baby (played by midget actor Billy Barty) hands Powell a can-opener. The number was cut from the film when it was re-issued after the arrival of strict Production Code enforcement in 1935 and was also deleted from the first prints available for television."

</p><p><dt><b>I'm No Angel  </b> (1933)<dd>Directed by Wesley Ruggles. Cast: Mae West, Cary Grant, Edward Arnold, Gregory Ratoff.
The bold Tira works as a dancing beauty and lion tamer at a fair. Out of an urgent need of money, she agrees to a risky new number: she'll put her head into the lion's mouth! With this attraction the circus makes it to New York and Tira can persue her dearest occupation: flirting with rich men. Among the guys she searches for the love of her life, from whom she only knows from a fortune-teller that he'll be rich and have black hair. When she finally meets him, she becomes a victim of intrigue.  "West, more imposing than coquettish as Tira the Lion Tamer, wields physical presence like a boxer and sexuality like a gunslinger throughout the film. From her opening scene, where she's introduced to a carnival crowd as "the girl who discovered you don't need feet to be a dancer," until the end, when she gets her man (Cary Grant, 29 years old and looking about 14, as upstanding society fellow Jack Clayton), Tira owns the screen.
It's not hard to imagine either why I'm No Angel, often considered the last film of pre-code Hollywood, was the breaking straw for the Hays Office, or why Depression-era audiences loved it so much. Tira violates conventions of race, class, and (of course) sex, and she goes entirely unpunished by the plot of the film. Instead, West, who took sole credit for the story, screenplay and dialogue, is careful to give herself the last laugh--the real currency of a film like this one--in every scene. In the climactic trial, she cross-examines much of her romantic history to prove, to a judge and jury with whom she flirts hilariously, that she's "no angel" but that she is, indisputably, a heroine. Here at SFist, we are hard pressed to think of a recent studio film in which a hypersexual female lead gets away with so much."

Soon afterward, Geraldine meets and falls in love with novelist Anthony Blake. Blake knows that she has had a man in her past, but he is content as long as he never finds out who it was.

<dt><b>International House</b> (1933)<dd>Directed by A. Edward Sutherland; featuring  W.C. Fields, George Burns, Gracie Allen, Peggy Hopkins Joyce, Rudy Vallee, Stuart Erwin, Sari Maritza, Col. Stoopnagle, Budd, Cab Calloway and his orchestra, Baby Rose Marie, Bela Lugosi.  A zany scientist in China invents a radio you can see: television. Every country wants to buy the rights, so characters from around the world converge on China and collide into a free-wheeling double-dealing variety show. "Perhaps one of the most surreal and special experiences in Hollywood filmmaking. The musical numbers are a hoot -- especially the chorus made up of dancers dressed in art deco celophane outfits and Cab Calloway's manic rendition of "Reefer Man" (not to mention a pre-adolescent and disturbingly sexy Baby Rose Marie performing a hot torch number). The jokes are a treat -- you'll find yourself saying, "I can't believe they got away with this!" when you hear some of the lines from WC Fields as well as Burns and Allen (it was pre-code, by the way)."

</p><p><dt><b>Island of Lost Souls  </b> (1932)<dd>Directed by Erle C. Kenton. Cast: Charles Laughton, Bela Lugosi, Richard Arlen, Leila Hyams, the Panther woman. 
Charles Laughton plays Dr. Moreau, the benign-looking doctor who lives and works on his own private South Seas island. When a shipwreck leaves Edward Parker stranded on the island, he learns of the hideous experiments that the doctor has been conducting in an area of the island known as "the House of Pain". When Parker encounters the beautiful creature Lota, the panther woman, Dr. Moreau gets the idea to create the first human-animal child through the two of them.  "<I>Island of Lost Souls</I> and <I>Freaks </I>present images of revolution  in which "downtrodden masses, tribes of the misshapen and mutated" overthrow "a hierarchy not merely of power but of beauty."   Many  Depression-era Americans may well have identified with the tragic animalmen of Island as they revolted against their evil sovereign. [<B>Pre-code Hollywood : sex, immorality, and insurrection in American cinema, 1930-1934</B> New York : Columbia University Press, c1999. p. 308 (MAIN: PN1995.62 .D65 1999)].  All this is not to mention the unsavory sexual tension between Parker and the panther woman, and the spectacle of a scientist dangerously overstepping his bounds (Moreau: "Mr. Parker, do you know what it means to feel like God?") 
Based on the novel "The island of Dr. Moreau" by H.G. Wells.  71 min. <b>DVD X5657; vhs 999:939</b>

A young woman believes that an actor committed the murder for which her brother has been imprisoned, and she gets her fianc--a newspaper reporter--to accompany her in following the suspected killer aboard a ship headed for South America. While they're at sea, disaster strikes and the ship is sunk. The three of them, plus the actor's friend, are washed up on a deserted island.  "..."Jungle Bride" has its grim moments, most notable perhaps being Mr. Starrett's hand-to-hand struggle with an animal which looks like a lion, roars like a lion and acts like a playful kitten. To the audience, which yesterday greeted this scene with well-bred laughter, it seemed that Mr. Starrett was going to have his problems holding the lion up for the duration of the fight."

Film classic which tells the story of a giant ape captured on an island who proceeds to terrorize New York until his final stand atop the Empire State Building.  Fay Wray's scanty attire would have never passed later code requirements, not to mention her questionable relationship with the Big Ape--a kind of inter-species (or interracial) form of forbidden love.   "King Kong was released four times between 1933 and 1952.  Scenes of Kong eating people or stepping on them were cut, as was his peeling off of Ann's dress.

Since both lovelorn ladies are played by Norma Shearer, melodrama fans know they're in for double the romantic heartache. Shearer was on the cusp of stardom when she took these showy dual roles.

<dt><b>The Marx Brothers</b><DD>Full of anarchy, irreverence, and general lunacy, the Marx Brothers pre-code comedies undoubtedly caused more than a bit of nervousness on the part of movie censors. ""Beyond the Alps lies more Alps, and the Lord helps those that Alp themselves"; a line from...Horse Feathers. The Hays Office probably would have queried this had Horse Feathers been made after the 1934 Production Code and it's a wonder that, despite its pre-Code vintage, Animal Crackers was allowed to retain Groucho's possibly blasphemous "Africa is God's Country and He can have it" (the same might be said of a Duck Soup song, All God's Chillon Got Guns)."

<P><DT><B>Of Human Bondage</B> (1934)<DD>Directed by John Cromwell.  Cast:    Leslie Howard, Betty Davis. 
A young medical student's infatuation with a slutish Cockney waitress in Edwardian London only brings him sorrow and despair.  "Of Human Bondage was placed on the Catholic Church's "condemned" list in Aug 1934... According to files in the MPAA/PCA Collection at the AMPAS Library, Dr. James Wingate, Director of Studio Relations of the AMPPA, informed RKO executive Merian C. Cooper in late May 1933 that an early draft of the script presented "so many difficulties that it appears...to be impossible to present...under the Code." Joseph I. Breen, Public Relations Director of the AMPPA, concurred with Wingate's assessment and suggested that "Mildred's" disease in the story be changed from syphilis to tuberculosis. Shortly before filming began, Breen approved changes that were made in the script and wrote in an inter-office memo that, while the story was "very dangerous...from a number of angles," it was also "something of a classic" and "so regarded by modern readers of fiction." A memo from Breen to RKO, which was included in RKO production files, indicates that Breen objected to the following aspects of the completed film: shots of Carey's nude sketches that "emphasized" the figure's breasts; Mildred's line in reference to the drawings, "All of it going on in your head"; and the scene in which Mildred picks up a man in front of a shop window."

Cast: Boris Karloff, Melvyn Douglas, Gloria Stuart, Charles Laughton, William Bond, Ernest Thesiger, Eva    Moore, Raymond Massey, Brember Wills, Elspeth Dudgeon.  A group of travelers on a mountain road, overtaken by a    thunderstorm and torrential rains, seek shelter in a   mysterious old mansion which turns out to be full of    eerie characters and uncanny happenings.

"Whale's version was subtle enough to avoid censorship, but the ambisexual ambience of the "Femm" family was still there.  ...The weirdest sequence in the film has Rebecca [Femm] (Eva Moore) unnerving a visitor, Margaret Waverton (Gloria Stewart):  "You think nothing but your long straight legs and your white body--and how to please your man.  You revel in the joys of fleshy love, don't you?  (Points to satin gown): That's fine stuff, but it'll rot.

Sports a typically racy pre-Code trailer, advertising "Every scene is a shock" and "It will run your temperature up to 105," capped with a final card from "The Management" exclaiming "This picture is NOT for people with weak hearts."

<P><dt><b>She Done Him Wrong</b> (1933)<dd>Directed by Lowell Sherman. Cast:  Mae West, Cary Grant, Owen Moore, Noah Beery, Gilbert Roland. Mae West as Lady Lou, a toughlady with a heart of gold, who dallys with assorted beaus, becomes entangled in murder, saves a Bowery mission and still has enough energy left to belt out a tune or two! "Is that a gun in your pocket or are you just glad to see me?" One of the lines that got Mae West in hot water and a Depression-stricken Paramount into the black, in Mae's blockbuster adaptation of her stage hit "Diamond Lil," with Salvation Army captain Cary Grant as the hunk she asks to "come up and see me sometime." 

<P>

"Mae West spent her career on the stage and screen skirting and sometimes transgressing the boundaries of sexual and moral propriety. In 1926 and 1927, she outraged some critics (and landed herself in jail) with two sensational Broadway productions, Sex (a play she wrote about a Montreal prostitute, in which she also starred) and <I>The Drag</I> (a 'homosexual comedy-drama' that she wrote and staged). In 1928, New York police arrested her again, this time for her play about a troupe of female impersonators, <I>Pleasure Man</I>. In 1932, she brought her brand of ribald humor to the movies. West's move from Broadway to Hollywood was surprising, given the substantially tighter moral scrutiny under which the film industry operated."

"Information in the MPAA/PCA Collection at the AMPAS Library reveals that Columbia first submitted the script to the PCA in Mar 1936. However, the PCA rejected the script because it violated several tenets of the Code. In a letter to Harry Cohn, PCA president Joseph I. Breen details the various elements in violation of the Code: The heroine, Theodora, exemplifies "evil made to appear attractive" after she breaks up two marriages; all the "decent" and "church-going" characters are "made to appear ridiculous, stupid and silly" when compared with their city counterparts, who "indulg[e] in extra-marital activities, drunkenness and debauchery, [and] are made to appear attractive." A second revised script was submitted to the PCA in Apr 1936 and was met with approval."

High-living, booze-swilling, innuendo-flinging Nick and Nora barely squeaked in under Joseph Breen's Production Code radar. 90 min. <b>DVD 4154; vhs 999:405</b>

<p><dt> <B>Three on a Match </B>(1932)<DD>Directed by   Mervyn LeRoy.  Cast: Virginia Davis, Joan Blondell, Anne Shirley, Ann Dvorak, Betty Carse, Bette Davis, Warren William, Lyle Talbot, Humphrey Bogart.  The gangster melodrama, Three on a Match, stars Bette Davis, Joan Blondell and Ann Dvorak as a trio of school chums - Mary, Ruth and Vivian - meeting for a reunion ten years after high school. Director Mervyn LeRoy crams much plot into the 64 minute run time following each of the women's lives. Mary is now a chorus girl after a stint in reform school; level-headed Ruth has a job as a secretary; and sexy Vivian is on the verge of deserting her wealthy husband Henry Kirkwood and their baby in favor of a glamorous gangster. The film is also noteworthy for the number of future stars making brief appearances, such as Lyle Talbot, Edward Arnold and, in his first gangster role, Humphrey Bogart as "The Mug." "The file for the film in the MPAA/PCA Collection at the AMPAS Library contains correspondence relating to the film's kidnapping scenes. In the wake of the Lindbergh kidnapping, censor boards were reluctant to pass a film that contained child kidnapping sequences because they felt that the public would resent such a film. Later, East coast censor boards agreed to pass this picture because the kidnappers in it are captured, but they subsequently entered into a "gentlemen's agreement" that the industry would not make any more pictures with kidnapping themes."

"According to the MPAA/PCA Collection at the AMPAS Library, the Hays Office strongly objected to the film after it was completed and demanded several extensive cuts. The sequence most objected to was the love scene between "Nella Vago" and "Jim Fletcher," about which Hays Office staff member Lamar Trotti commented, "This scene was one of the most offensive, if not the most offensive--in my recollection." Other scenes trimmed showed the character of Nella "writhing on a day-bed in a particularly offensive manner," and her being unable to sleep because of the honeymooners in the next room. The film was finally given a seal of approval for its original release, but when United Artists tried to re-issue it in 1935, the PCA requested that the studio withdraw it from consideration "on the grounds that [it is] highly questionable and [is] likely to be rejected by us." United Artists did so, and when they tried to re-issue the film in 1937, the PCA again rejected it."

<dt><b>West of Zanzibar </b> (1928) <dd>Directed by Tod Browning. Cast:  Lon Chaney, Lionel Barrymore, Warner Baxter, Mary Nolan, Jane Daly, Jacqueline Gadsdon, Roscoe Ward, Kalla Pasha, Curtis Nero. "West of Zanzibar opens on a picture of domestic bliss. Phroso (Chaney), an English music hall magician, is completely devoted to his wife, Anna (Jacqueline Hart). But appearances are deceiving and Anna soon abandons Phroso for her lover, Crane (Lionel Barrymore), an ivory trader. When Phroso goes to confront Crane, he is permanently crippled in a fight with his rival. A year later, Anna, with her baby daughter Maizie, attempts to return to Phroso but dies before she can reach him. Phroso adopts Maizie under the assumption that she was fathered by Crane and relocates to the jungles of Africa where he proceeds to raise her in a harsh and degrading environment among superstitious natives. When Maizie reaches the age of eighteen, Phroso plots his final act of revenge and summons Crane to their isolated outpost under false pretenses.

Considering the sensationalistic aspects of the story, it's no surprise that some sequences didn't make the final cut of West of Zanzibar. For one thing, the scene where Phroso makes an appearance as a "duck man" at a side show was deleted. Tod Browning would later use this bizarre costume for the horrific climax to <A HREF="#freaks">Freaks </A>where Olga Baclanova is transformed into the "duck woman." Another sequence that didn't get pass the censors is one where Phroso crawls into a bar on his wheeled platform, begging for handouts, and is tossed through a plate glass window into the street."

<p><dt><b>Wonder Bar</b> (1934 )  <dd>Directed by Lloyd Bacon. Dance numbers created and directed by Busby Berkeley. Cast: 	Al Jolson, Kay Francis, Dolores Del Rio, Ricardo Cortez, Dick Powell. 	"A murderess goes unpunished, gays dance together, infidelity runs rampant." [amazon.com] 
Proprietor Al Wonder, a master showman keeps the champagne flowing, the patrons glowing and the bills paid. In just one night at this merrily sophisticated Parisian watering hole, anything can happen ... and almost everything does. As in most of his film appearances Jolson, in effect, plays an entertainer based on his own stage persona. Berkeley's choreography is to be seen at its most imaginative and at a low point in Goin' to Heaven on a Mule, a number which embodies the patronising 'happy darkie' cliches prevalent in Hollywood movies well into the forties. 	Based on the play by Geza Herczeg, Karl Farkas and Robert Katscher. 84 min. <b>  DVD X1963</b>
