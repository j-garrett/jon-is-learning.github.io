<dt><b>Forever Bottom</b></dt>
<dd>A "pseudo-instructional" video that takes a humorous look at the stima attached to being on the receiving end in gay male sexual relationships. <a href="http://www.frameline.org">Frameline</a>. c1999. 4 min. <b>Video/C 7933</b><br>

<dt><b>Freeheld</b></dt>
<dd>Detective Lieutenant Laurel Hester spent 25 years investigating tough cases in Ocean County, New Jersey, protecting the rights of victims and putting her life on the line. She had no reason to expect that in the last year of her life, after she was diagnosed with terminal cancer, that her final battle for justice would be for the woman she loved. The film chronicles Laurel's struggle to transfer her earned pension to her domestic partner, Stacie Andree. With less than six months to live, Laurel refuses to back down when her elected officials -- the Ocean County Freeholders -- deny her request to leave her pension to Stacie, an automatic option for heterosexual married couples. The film is structured chronologically, following both the escalation of Laurel's battle with the Freeholders and the decline of her health as cancer spreads to her brain. Directed by Cynthia Wade. Special features: 100 additional minutes of never-before-seen footage, including: Oscar Day: Behind the Scenes, The Making of Freeheld, Laurel and Stacie's Video Diary, Laurel's Childhood, Communities Respond to Freeheld. 2007. 140 min. <b>DVD X3241</b><br></dd>
<dt><b>F**k the Disabled: The Suprising Adventures of Greg Walloch</b></dt>
<dd>Part documentary, part concert film and part traditional comedy starring New York stand-up comedian Greg Walloch. Politically incorrect and politically challenging, much of Greg's act is based on his being openly gay and disabled. Timely and witty, Walloch makes the viewer question the term "disabled," as he pokes fun at religion, society, his friends and himself. 2001. 83 min. <b>DVD 1185</b><br></dd>

Includes Oscar Wilde, a gay Nazi, a concentration camp survivor, gay rights pioneer Magnus Hirschfeld and even writer Hans Christian Anderson.

<dt><b>Gay Republicans.</b></dt>
<dd>In 2004, Log Cabin -- the Gay Republican Club -- was put to the test. President Bush's unequivocal opposition to gay marriage presented them with a stark choice, whether to be good Republicans and support the president, or stand up for gay rights. This decision opened schisms that threatened the unity of Log Cabin, as politics got personal and individuals were forced to decide if being gay is more important than being Republican. Written &amp; directed by Wash Westmoreland. c2005. 62 min. <b>DVD 4404</b><br></dd>

<dd>Documents the phenomenon of deliberate HIV infection. The film follows the stories of two "bug chasers" who sought out "the gift" of HIV infection. Also interviewed are AIDS activist and author, Walt Odets, and HIV+ and HIV- men. The film explores the normalization and glamorization of HIV/AIDS and discusses the isolation and division caused by HIV status in the gay community. Bonus feature: Does anyone die of AIDS anymore? (26 min., 2002). Produced and directed by Louise Hogarth. 2002. 62 min. <b>DVD 5027</b><br></dd>
<dt><b>Girls Kissing.</b></dt>
<dd>Goes behind the scenes with porn stars, a Penthouse photographer, ad execs and purveyors of adult sex toys to explore lesbian relationships. It also touches on underlying questions: Is the mainstream portrayal of lesbian sex accurate? How much pressure does this exert on otherwise straight women to explore lesbian relationships and does it confuse teenage girls or push them prematurely towards sexual experimentation? 2003. 49 min. <b>Video/C MM359</b><br></dd>
<dt><b>Grapefruit: The Story of John and Yoko.</b></dt>
<dd>Featuring an all-female cast - including Shelley Cook as Ono, Susie Bright as Lennon - this film plays with the romanticized history of the iconic Fab Four, gently mocking John and Yoko's banal squabbles and obsessive rituals of self-display. The film works on many levels to reposition the mythic tale of the Beatles boy's life by casting '80's women in mod drag, effectively mapping the lesbian sub-culture onto heterosexual mass culture. Discounting the importance of historical accuracy, Dougherty gives an incisive reading of the creation of pop culture icons with John Lennon portrayed as a projection of our society's collective needs and desires. 1989. 40 min. <b>Video 999:2003</b><br>

<dt><b>The Homosexuals (CBS Report)</b></dt>
<dd>A CBS Reports program that underscores the difference between modern (1966) sexual morals and those of the dominant culture. Mike Wallace attempts to give even-handed treatment to a subject very much taboo at the time by concluding that homosexuality is most probably a disease, mainly a male phenomenon, involving those incapable of maintaining deep and long lasting relationships. Gore Vidal makes an appearance and sounds a modern tone in the depths of this 40-year old stopped time piece, but his insights and observations are cut into pieces amidst much broader coverage of insistent anti-homosexual psychologists on the one hand and shadowy interviews with male homosexuals. A media history landmark produced in the same New York City that three years later saw the Stonewall riots that began the modern era of gay power activism. 1966. 44 min. <b>DVD 8569</b><br>

<dd>"The complete, extraordinary "reperformance" by Ron Vawter of Jack Smith's 1981 performance piece, What's Underground About Marshmallows?, in which Jack, strongly against the commodification of art and fearful that people were making illegal copies of his films, accuses Jonas Mekas, the champion of avant-garde film in the early '60s, of this diabolical infringement. In Marshmallows, Jack tells a funny, pathetic tale "on" himself--a nightmare of failing to catch Mekas--called variously "Uncle Artcrust," "Uncle Fishhook" and sometimes "Old Uncle Oldie"--in the act of duplication." [description from <a href="http://www.facets.org/">FACETS catalog</a>] Also includes Ron Vawter's performs portrayal of a classic Roy Cohn after-dinner speech for the Society for the Protection of the American Family. "An intense cinematic translation of a theatre piece in which actor Ron Vawter interprets the dual roles of Roy Cohn--the racist, reactionary prosecutor of the Joe McCarthy era and beyond who battled civil rights for homosexuals though he was homosexual himself--and Jack Smith, the open, avant-garde filmmaker/performanceartist of Flaming Creatures. 'These two men, who had nothing in common except their death from AIDS in the late '80s, are resurrected by Vawter and Godmilow in a constrast of stance, from which is born, little by little, a sensation of undoing, of sadness, of finitude' (La Stampa)." 1998. 90 min. <b>Video/C 7682; Roy Cohn/Jack Smith also on DVD X3479</b><br></dd>

<dd>"What's big, tough, and wears size twelve pumps? Some of the drag queens in Wigstock: The Movie (Goldwyn), that's what. If you've never been down to the Greenwich Village piers on Labor Day weekend to witness the event called "Wigstock" in the flesh, then this documentary is for you. It is not necessary to cross-dress to enjoy this high-spirited look at big hair and heavy pancake. The wig-in emceed by the ever brassy Lady Bunny is celebrating its tenth anniversary and the movie, directed by Barry Shils, utilizes footage from Wigstock's past, but not forgotten. The event began in Tompkins Square Park, was then moved to Union Square Park, but just kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger. What else would you expect with all that teasing going on? Now ensconced at the foot of Christopher Street, Wigstock has found it's home. Making guest appearances are Mistress Formica, Deee-lite, the Duelling Bankheads, RuPaul and the dyvine Lypsinka."

<dt><b>Regretters</b></dt>
<dd>Regretters gives heartfelt voice to two transgendered people who underwent sex change surgery to become women. Now, years later, they would like to return to their original, masculine selves. Through their experiences we learn how very complicated gender identity is; morphing from one gender to another is not accomplished solely by sexual reassignment surgery. Orlando and Mikael are Swedish, now in their sixties. Meeting for the first time, they face one another on a stage and engage in a spontaneous dialogue. Orlando, an androgynous dandy dressed in a red velvet suit, had one of the first sex change operations in Sweden in 1967. He tells of his eleven year marriage to a man who never suspected that his wife had not been born female. Mikael, dressed as a man, underwent the surgery in the 1990's when he was fifty years old. He has tried to convince his doctors to change him back, as he feels desperately lost between genders, trapped inside a body that is not his.
