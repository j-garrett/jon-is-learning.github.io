<dt><b>Age of Hope, 1900 (<i>People's Century</i>).</b></dt>
<dd>The dawn of the twentieth century was forged in hope and optimism. Here interviewees from Europe, Asia and the United States (boasting an average age of 102), recount the part they played in the century's early history. Whether fighting on the barricades of the failed Russian Revolution of 1905 or campaigning for votes for women; recalling the Paris Exposition of 1900, or President McKinley's assassination or witnessing the sinking of the Titanic, all remember the changes they lived through and the clash of forces and ideas before World War I. 1998. 56 min. <b>DVD X5249; vhs Video/C 5555</b><br>
<br></dd>
<dt><b>The Cold War.</b> 1998. 47 min. each installment.<br></dt>
<dd>&#149;<b>Comrades, 1917-1945.</b> Though ideological enemies, the Soviet Union and the United States are allies against Hitler during WWII. At the end of the war, Europe is divided, and the one-time allies now confront each other knowing that the United States has the atomic bomb. <b>Video/C 5735</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149;<b>Iron Curtain, 1945-1947.</b> The Soviet Union dominates Eastern Europe. Churchill warns of the consequences. Stalin insists that the governments of the Soviet Union's client states be pro-communist. Impoverished after the war, Great Britain opts out as a world power. The United States assumes the mantle of world leadership. <b>Video/C 5735</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Marshall Plan, 1947-1952.</b> The United States adopts the Truman doctrine, pledging to defend freedom worldwide. Secretary of State George Marshall plans to bolster economic recovery in Europe. Seeing this as a threat, Stalin forbids his satellites to participate. The world effectively divides. <b>Video/C 5735</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149;<b>Berlin, 1948-1949</b> In Berlin, the American, British and French sectors form a Western enclave in the Soviet zone of divided Germany. In June 1948, the Soviets blockade the city, but the Western allies successfully airlift in supplies. In August 1949, Soviet scientists explode an atomic bomb, establishing nuclear parity between the two superpowers. <b>Video/C 5736</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Reds, 1947-1953.</b> Following Stalin's domination of Eastern Europe and the loss of China, American democracy falls victim to anti-communist hysteria, but survives it. Eisenhower is elected President. In the Soviet Union, Stalin reinforces the climate of terror on which his rule is based. When he dies in 1953, the Soviet people mourn the end of an era. <b>Video/C 5736</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149;<b>Korea, 1949-1953.</b> In June 1950, North Korea invades the South, with Stalin's blessing. The United States, backed by the United Nations, defends South Korea, and then is confronted by communist China. In mid-1951, the war grinds to a bloody stalemate but eventually an armistice is signed. Aggression has been contained. <b>Video/C 5736</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>After Stalin, 1953-1956.</b> Thaw is conceivable with Stalin's death. Khrushchev outmaneuvers Malenkov for power and visits the West. Germans, Poles and Hungarians attempt to rise against Soviet rule. In 1956, an uprising in Hungary is ruthlessly crushed by Soviet tanks. The United States, pledged to contain rather than overthrow communism, does nothing. <b>Video/C 5737</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149;<b>Sputnik, 1949-1961.</b> In the mid-50s, the Soviet Union seems to be forging ahead. In October 1957, the first Soviet satellite Sputnik orbits the earth--to the dismay and fear of the United States, frustrated by its own ineffectual space program. In 1961, the Soviets launch Yuri Gargarin into space. America will have to meet the challenge. <b>Video/C 5737</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>The Wall, 1958-1963.</b> The fate of Germany remains unresolved. West Germany has been admitted to NATO. Within East Germany, Berlin is divided between East and West by an open border. Thousands seize the chance to flee the communist system. To keep their people in, the East Germans, with Soviet backing, build The Wall. <b>Video/C 5737</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149;<b>Cuba, 1959-1962.</b> Khruschev decides, with Castro's agreement, to install short-range and medium-range missiles in Cuba, only 90 miles from the U.S. The United States detects the missile sites and blockades the island. The superpowers confront each other; but rather than embark on nuclear war, they each step back. <b>Video/C 5738</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149;<b>Vietnam, 1954-1968.</b> Vietnam has been divided since the end of French colonial rule. The North is run by communists, the South by anti-communists. Ignoring warnings against involvement in a nationalist struggle, the United States commits its armed forces. American protests against the war mount as the U.S. begins to realize this is not a war it can win. <b>Video/C 5738</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>MAD, 1960-1972.</b> Throughout the 60s, the U.S. and the Soviet Union are locked in a nuclear stand-off; each realizes that bombing the enemy could provoke retaliation and self-destruction. Nuclear strategy evolves into Mutual Assured Destruction, or MAD, in which both sides are guaranteed certain annihilation in the event of nuclear war. <b>Video/C 5738</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Make Love Not War, The Sixties.</b> Western economies grow and prosper, fueled partly by armaments production. Rejecting their parents' affluence and the Cold War, many of the young protest and rebel. There is racial violence in U.S. inner cities while rock music comes to express the mood of a disenchanted generation. <b>Video/C 5739</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Red Spring, The Sixties.</b>In the Soviet bloc, communist rule stifles ambition and achievement. Soviet defense expenditure cripples economic growth. The young lust for totems of America's youth culture--blue jeans and rock-n-roll. In Czechoslovakia, Dubcek attempts limited reform, but in 1968, Soviet force crushes the Prague Spring. <b>Video/C 5739</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>China, 1949-1972.</b> Chinese communists win the longest civil war in 20th century history. Mao's land reforms are popular but in 1958, he embarks on a series of catastrophic changes. China maintains an increasingly uneasy relationship with the Soviet Union. In 1960 the Sino-Soviet split paves the way for President Nixon's historic visit to Beijing. <b>Video/C 5739</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Detente, 1969-1975.</b> North Vietnam launches a new offensive against the South. The U.S. steps up its bombing campaign but seeks peace through diplomacy. Nixon and Brezhnev sign the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT). The U.S. finally withdraws from Vietnam. Detente culminates in the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. <b>Video/C 5740</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Good Guys, Bad Guys, 1967-1978</b> The superpowers use surrogates to wage ideological and often physical conflict. In 1967 and 1973, American backed-Israel triumphs over Soviet-backed Egypt and Syria. In Africa, the Soviets exploit nationalist, anti-colonial struggles. The U.S. supports South Africa in its battle against communism. <b>Video/C 5740</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Backyard, 1954-1990.</b> The U.S. has always regarded Latin America as its own backyard. Fearing the spread of communism, it seeks to destabilize leftist governments. In 1973, the CIA helps overthrow the Chilean President Salvador Allende; in the 1980s, it supports right-wing extremists in Nicaragua and El Salvador. <b>Video/C 5740</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Freeze, 1977-1981.</b> Concern for human rights in the East grows; detente ebbs. The Soviets arm Eastern Europe. The U.S. threatens to site missiles in Western Europe. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan ends detente. Promising tougher measures against Moscow, Reagan defeats Carter for the presidency. In Poland, martial law is imposed. <b>Video/C 5741</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Soldiers of God, 1975-1988.</b> Afghanistan is a war that costs the lives of almost 15,000 Soviet conscripts and an estimated one million Afghans. The U.S. supplies billions of dollars of weapons to unlikely allies--Islamic fundamentalists. The result is a Vietnam-style conflict which takes its toll on the Soviets and hastens the end of the Cold War. <b>Video/C 5741</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Spies, 1944-1994.</b> Early CIA attempts to penetrate the Iron Curtain are thwarted. The U.S. reacts with increasingly sophisticated technological intelligence--the U-2 spy-plane, satellite reconnaissance and electronic eavesdropping. Yet human spies remain important. Sometimes betrayers, sometimes betrayed, many spies pay with their lives. <b>Video/C 5741</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Star Wars, 1980-1988.</b> Reagan boosts U.S. defense spending and proposes the Strategic Defense Initiative, an anti-missile system in space. New premier Gorbachev knows the Soviets can't match the U.S., and wants to liberalize and reconstruct the Russian economy. After summits in Geneva, Reykjavik and Washington, the leaders agree to drastic arms cuts. <b>Video/C 5742</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>The Wall Comes Down, 1989.</b> Incredibly quickly, the Soviet bloc is breaking up, virtually without bloodshed. First Poland, then Hungary, then East Germany slip away from communist control. Gorbachev makes no effort to hold them back with force. Amid scenes of jubilation, the hated Berlin Wall comes down. <b>Video/C 5742</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Cold War. Conclusions</b>The U.S. proves the stronger, the Soviet Union implodes. Germany is reunified. Shorn of its empire and communist domination, Russia faces its future with its economy in chaos. The balance of terror that has kept the peace for more than 40 years vanishes. The Cold War has ended without the use of nuclear weapons. <b>Video/C 5742</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>Grandma's Tattoos</b></dt>
<dd>Reveals the fate of thousands of forgotten women, mostly teenagers and young girls, who survived the 1915 Armenian Genocide but were forced into prostitution by their captors. Many of these women were tattooed as a permanent mark of their status. Filmmaker Suzanne Khardalian begins the film by remembering her grandmother: "Grandma Khanoum was not like everyone else. She had blue tattoos on her face and hands. She despised physical contact. She never hugged anyone, never gave kisses. And she always wore gloves, which hid her hands and her tattoos, and her secret." Haunted by these memories, Khardalian embarks on a personal journey into her family history to investigate the truth behind her late grandmother. Eventually small truths are revealed and pieces of the puzzle begin to come together. In 1919, just at the end of WWI, the Allied forces rescued nearly 100,000 Armenian girls and children who, during the war years, were forced to become prostitutes to survive, or had given birth to children after forced or arranged marriages or rape. These women were forcibly marked, tattooed, as property, the same way you mark cattle. Following the war, many of these women were viewed as impure and tainted, and often shunned by society.

<dt><b>People Power, 1989 (<i>People's Century</i>).</b></dt>
<dd>In 1991, the Communist Party lost control of the Soviet Union, the culmination of a process that started in 1980 in the Polish shipyards when millions joined Lech Walesa's Solidarity movement which signaled the beginning of the end for Soviet-style communism. Here eyewitnesses tell the story of how the Communist system collapsed as they remember the extraordinary weeks that preceded and followed the fall of the Berlin Wall; Poland's fight for solidarity; Czechoslovakia's "Velvet Revolution;" the struggle for power in the Soviet Union and more. 1998. 56 min. <b>Video/C 5554</b><br></dd>
<dt><b>Poland: We've Caught God by the Arm.</b> (Force More Powerful: A Century of Nonviolent Conflict)</dt>
<dd>In August, 1980, workers at the Gdansk shipyard went on strike. Lech Walesa was the chief negotiator for the workers, who avoided the mistakes of earlier strikes by maintaining strict nonviolent discipline--and by occupying their shipyard, to deter a violent crackdown by authorities. The strike quickly spread throughout the country and a new union was born named "Solidarity." The government imposed martial law and banned the union which continued its work underground until 1989 when it re-emerged as a revitalized political force, and won decisively in Poland's first free elections in 60 years. 2000. 31 min. <b>Video/C 7376</b><br></dd>
<dt><b>The Mystery of Poland (L' &eacute;nigme polonaise)</b></dt>
<dd>A film by Georges Mink et Virginie Linhart. Nearly twenty years after the collapse of communism, Poland is still hesitating. It is torn between liberalism and communism, between offering amnesty or launching a witch hunt. To understand this indecision, we have to go back to 1989 and the round table talks between communists and opposition groups that enabled Poland to peacefully shake off communism. With personal accounts from Walesa, Geremek, Mazowiecki, Generals Jaruzelski and Kiszczak, and former Polish President Alexander Kwasniewski, including never-before-seen footage unearthed from Polish television archives, the film tells the secrets of Poland's past and throws light on its politics in the present.

The filmmaker explores what happens when nothing happens. The theme of crime and punishment is present in every moment. When there is no death sentence, there is only time.

<dt><b>Animated Soviet Propaganda.</b><br></dt>
<dd>&#149;<b>American Imperialists.</b> Racism, unemployment, aggression, excess -- the USSR's animation studios frequently took aim at these aspects of American culture. Representing five decades of animated Soviet propaganda, this program features short films that blast the U.S. and its perceived evils. Black and White and Mister Twister extol the absence of bigotry in Soviet society while Someone Else's Voice portrays jazz as "an enemy of the people." Ave Maria condemns America's presence in Vietnam and the influence of the Catholic Church, and The Shooting Gallery underscores the violence behind economic and class divisions. 81 min. <b>DVD 5702</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Fascist Barbarians.</b> Hitler's invasion of Russia and Germany's post-WWII partition inspired a great deal of animated Soviet Propaganda.

<dd>&#149;<b>Capitalist Sharks.</b> Just as America envisioned Communist threats during much of the 20th century, the specter of capitalism loomed large in the Soviet Cold War psyche. This program surveys Soviet animated propaganda, embodying that fiercely anti-capitalist spirit. Foreshadowing the space race, Interplanetary Revolution depicts a Communist triumph over free-market forces on Mars; China in Flames warns against capitalist interference in the Chinese Revolution; Shareholder proclaims the superiority of the Soviet economic system; and Proud Little Ship takes on capitalist aggression. 98 min. <b>DVD 5704</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149;<b>Onward to the Shining Future.</b> Soviet film studios worked hard to portray their government's system as idyllic and forward-looking. This program showcases animated films designed to promote that utopian vision. Soviet Toys, the earliest known example of Soviet animation, condemns Lenin's New Economic Policy; The Victorious Destination celebrates the achievements of Stalin's first five-year plan; Samoyed Boy praises the Soviet educational system and the casting-off of antiquated traditions; and Hot Stone, Little Organ, and Songs of the Fire Years rejoice over the passing of Czarist imperialism and the establishment of a new, benevolent society.

<dd>&#149;<b>Putin: A Bitter Decision.</b>In the mind of Vladimir Putin, 9/11/01 marked the day that triggered a chain of events that ended with Russia's acceptance into the ranks of the West-but at a terrible cost to national pride and the balance of nuclear power. This program narrates the circumstances leading to President Putin's bitter decision to trade U.S. approval of the war in Chechnya for what has proved to be a diminished role in world politics. Footage of Putin, George W. Bush, Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov, Security Council Secretary Vladimir Rushailo, and Djuma Namangani, military commander of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, is featured, along with gripping images of New York's Ground Zero and Central Asian Islamist extremists in action. <b>DVD 6280</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>Roma Rights</b>(Life; 5)</dt>
<dd>The Roma have an exotic image: musicians, actors, artists, and sometimes beggars. Europeans called them 'Gypsies' because they thought they came from Egypt. But Romani people have lived in Europe for over a thousand years, and they originally came from India, not Egypt. Roma communities in Europe have been subjected to centuries of persecution and racism. They are one of the most excluded groups in the world. They are denied the chance to work, proper housing, healthcare and their children refused a decent education. A new initiative - the Decade of Roma Inclusion - was launched in 2005 in a concerted attempt to help break the desperate cycle of poverty in which so many Roma live.

<dt><b>We Have No War-Songs: Gypsies: the Professional Amateurs of Life.</b></dt>
<dd>Since their appearance in Europe first recorded in the 14th century, the Gypsies have always struggled for the freedom to live their own lives in their own way.

Filmed at the seven day gathering of thousands of Gypsies from all over the World in Saintes Maires de-la Mer in the South of France, this film celebrates the unique nature of the Gypsy people and poses questions of tolerance and individuality in today's increasingly materialistic and nationalistic world.
