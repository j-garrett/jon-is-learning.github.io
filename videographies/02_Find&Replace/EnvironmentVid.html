<dt><b>End of the Line</b></dt>
<dd>Charts the devastating ecological impact of overfishing by interweaving both local and global stories of sharply declining fish populations, including the imminent extinction of the bluefin tuna, and illuminates how our modern fishing capacities far outstrip the survival abilities of any ocean species. Scientists explain how this depletion has slipped under the public radar and outline the catastrophic future that awaits us -- an ocean without fish by 2048 -- if we do not adjust our fishing and consumption practices. Based on the book by Charles Clover (Bioscience &amp; Natural Resources SH327.5 .C56 2004). Special features: Webisodes: The biggest problem you've never heard of (10 min.), The European Union, a world leader in overfishing (9 min.), The future of fisherman (10 min.), The future of protection (8 min.), The future of seafood (9 min.), The future of fish (9 min.) ; The coral triangle: nursery of the seas [short film] (13 min.) ; Ted Danson on The End of the line ; original theatrical trailer ; filmmaker bio.

<dt><b>Milking the Rhino</b></dt>
<dd>A ferocious kill on the Serengeti; warnings about endangered species... These clich&eacute;s of nature films ignore a key landscape feature: villagers just off-camera who endure the dangers and costs of living with wild animals. The Maasai tribe of Kenya and Namibia's Himba -- two of earth's oldest cattle cultures -- are emerging from a century of 'white man's conservation,' which threw them off their lands, banned subsistence hunting and fueled resentment. They are discovering that earnings from wildlife tourism can rival the benefits of livestock. But change is not easy. Charting the collision of ancient ways with Western expectations, this film offers complex, intimate stories of Africans at the forefront of community-based conservation. Directed, produced, written and edited by David E. Simpson. Dist.: <a href="http://www.kartemquin.com/">Kartemquin Films</a>. 2008. 83 min. <b>DVD X1879</b><br>

<dt><b>Civilization and Climate (<i>Climate &amp; Man&lt;; 3</i>).</b></dt>
<dd>Changing climate probably played the decisive role in drawing hominids out of the trees, up on their hind legs, and off in search of food whose supply had been dispersed by the replacement of rain forests by grasslands. Migrations were motivated by the search for food; during ice ages, when sea levels dropped, new areas became accessible and populations spread. Links between climatic changes and emerging civilizations have also been postulated; the collapse of civilizations confronted with climatic challenges to which they could not or would not adapt is clearly documented.

<dt><b>Climate Refugees: The Human Face of Climate Change</b></dt>
<dd>Explores the global human impact of climate change and its serious destabilizing effect on international politics, turning the distant concept of global warming into a concrete human problem with worldwide consequences. Experts predict that by mid-century hundreds of millions of people will be uprooted as the result of sea level rise and an increase in extreme weather events, drought and desertification. Little is being done to plan for the potential mass migration of millions of refugees who will be forced to cross national borders. According to the UN, environmental refugees currently outnumber political and religious refugees. The Pentagon now considers climate change a national security risk and "climate wars" are discussed in war-rooms. Whether human-caused or a product of nature, the changing climate is already creating humanitarian disasters leading to worldwide political instability.

<dt><b>Danger Ahead (<i>Climate &amp; Man; 6</i>).</b></dt>
<dd>This program suggests some less drastic solutions to the global warming : reducing CO2 emissions; using the sun and the wind as energy sources; using nuclear power; reducing energy usage; curbing or stopping the use of CFCs; preserving the rain forest. It may also be taken as a given that, while individuals may be able to adapt to climatic change, societies cannot. c1990. 26 min. <b>Video/C 2406</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>The Great Global Warming Swindle</b></dt>
<dd>Challenges the current premise of global warming, suggesting that the chief cause of climate change is not human activity, but changes in radiation from the sun. Scientists in the film set forth scientific and historical proofs to support their arguments and claim that global warming advocates have created a mass hysteria that has no basis in reality. They also examine the censorship and intimidation experienced by dissenting scientists perpetrated by political and environmental activists who have an economic stake in the debate. The film also looks at the economic costs of a movement to discourage development in third world countries by those who claim industrializaton is a primary cause of global warming.

<dd>On June 2, 2000, 151 kilograms of liquid mercury spilled from a truck hauling the mercury away from the Yanacocha goldmine in the Peruvian Andes.

<dt><b>Our Daily Poison</b></dt>
<dd>According to the World Health Organization, the incidence of cancer has doubled over the last thirty years. Over this period, the increase in leukemia and brain tumours in children has been around 2% per year. The WHO has observed a similar trend for neurological diseases (Parkinson's and Alzheimer's) and autoimmune disorders. This documentary launches an in-depth investigation into everyday products and the systems charged with regulating them, examining the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) archives. Seeking answers the filmmaker manages to talk her way into secret meetings, and meets with regulators and respected renegade researchers throughout North American and Europe. The film shows that the main cause of the epidemic is environmental: the result of the 100,000 chemical molecules that have invaded our environment, and primarily our food, since the end of the Second World War.

<dt><b>The Spill</b></dt>
<dd>Martin Smith and Abraham Lustgarten explore the corporate history of BP before the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico. Their investigation reveals a history of safety and environmental violations. This investigation shows that British Petroleum's leadership has failed to create a culture of safety in their massive company. As BP took increasingly big risks to find oil and extract it, the company left behind a trail of mounting problems: deadly accidents, disastrous spills, countless safety violations. Each time, BP acknowledged the wider flaws in its culture and made empty promises to do better. From the refineries to the oil fields to the Gulf of Mexico, BP workers understood that profits came first. Through interviews with current and former employees and executives, government regulators and safety experts, Frontline correspondent Martin Smith and ProPublica reporter Abrahm Lustgarten examine the trail that led to the disaster in the gulf. Producers, Marcela Gaviria and Martin Smith. Originally broadcast as an episode of the television series "Frontline", October 26, 2010. 60 min. <b>DVD X5418</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>[Bari, Judy] The Forest for the Trees.</b></dt>
<dd>On May 29, 1990, Earth First! organizer Judi Bari's car was bombed in Oakland, California. Within three hours of the bombing, Bari was accused of transporting the explosives that had nearly killed her. Still in the hospital, she was arrested, and soon labeled a terrorist in the national media. The charges were later dropped. For the next twelve years, Bari and civil rights lawyer Dennis Cunningham would pursue a federal civil rights suit against the FBI and the Oakland police department. This documentary, directed by Cunningham's daughter, is an intimate, behind-the-scenes look at Bari's fight, an important instance of the false and damaging association of dissent with crime and terrorism. At the heart of the film is Bari, a folk hero with an electrifying onscreen presence, and the legal battle that few believed she could win.

<dt><b>Waste = Food</b></dt>
<dd>American "green" architect, William McDonough and German "green" chemist, Michael Braungart teamed up to realise the Waste = food principle in man-made products, believing that all products must be completely biodegradable in the biosphere and serve as food for the natural organisms there, and that all non-degradable material must be able to be used as high-quality raw material for new products. They introduced their ideas to Nike, the Ford Motor Company, and China. They helped Ford transform their heavily polluted manufacturing sites into green areas that are safe enough for children to play in. Due to their encouragement, Nike has designed toxin-free running shoes that can be completely recycled.

<dt><b>National Parks: America's Best Idea</b></dt>
<dd>Produced by Dayton Duncan and Ken Burns. Originally broadcast as episodes of the television documentary on PBS in 2009. <b>DVD X2127</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149;<b>Episode One, The Scripture of Nature (1851-1890)</b> In 1851, word spreads across the country of a beautiful area of California' Yosemite Valley, attracting visitors who wish to exploit the land's scenery for commercial gain and those who wish to keep it pristine. Among the latter is a Scottish-born wanderer named John Muir, for whom protecting the land becomes a spiritual calling. In 1864, Congress passes an act that protects Yosemite from commedirector, Rob van Hattum director, Rob van Hattum director, Rob van Hattum rcial development for "public use, resort and recreation" the first time in world history that any government has put forth this idea and hands control of the land to California. Meanwhile, a "wonderland" in the northwest corner of the Wyoming territory attracts visitors to its bizarre landscape of geysers, mud pots and sulfur pits. In 1872, Congress passes an act to protect this land as well. Since it is located in a territory, rather than a state, it becomes America' first national park: Yellowstone. Special feature: The making of the National Parks. Filmmaker Ken Burns and his longtime colleague Dayton Duncan take us on a behind-the-scenes tour of their series the National Parks: America's Best Ideas. Includes Spanish audio and subtitles. 116 min. <b>DVD X2127</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149;<b>Episode Two, The Last Refuge (1890-1915)</b> By the end of the 19th century, widespread industrialization has left many Americans worried about whether the country will have any pristine land left. At the same time, poachers in the parks are rampant, and visitors think nothing of littering or carving their names near iconic sites like Old Faithful. Congress has yet to establish clear judicial authority or appropriations for the protection of the parks. This sparks a conservation movement by organizations such as the Sierra Club, led by John Muir; the Audubon Society, led by George Bird Grinnell; and the Boone and Crockett Club, led by Theodore Roosevelt. The movement fails, however, to stop San Francisco from building the Hetch Hetchy dam at Yosemite, flooding Muir's "mountain temple" and leaving him broken-hearted before he dies. Special feature: Capturing the parks: a behind-the-scenes look. Ken Burns, Dayton Duncan and their crew on location at Denali, the Grand Canyon and other national parks. 131 min. <b>DVD X2127</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149;<b>Episode three, The Empire of Grandeur (1915-1919)</b> In the early 20th century, America has a dozen national parks, but they are a haphazard patchwork of special places under the supervision of different federal agencies. The conservation movement, after failing to stop the Hetch Hetchy dam, pushes the government to establish one unified agency to oversee all the parks, leading to the establishment of the National Park Service in 1916. Its first director, Stephen Mather, a wealthy businessman and passionate park advocate who fought vigorously to establish the NPS, launches an energetic campaign to expand the national park system and bring more visitors to the parks. Among his efforts is to protect the Grand Canyon from encroaching commercial interests and establish it as a national park, rather than a national monument. Special feature: Musical journeys through the National Parks. National parks timeline, "Peace a last/Across the ocean", "Horizons", "Green groves of Erin", "The shores of Ogygia", "Teddy Bears' picnic". 114 min. <b>DVD X2127</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149;<b>Episode Four, Going Home (1920-1933)</b> While visiting the parks was once predominantly the domain of Americans wealthy enough to afford the high-priced train tours, the advent of the automobile allows more people than ever before to visit the parks. Mather embraces this opportunity and works to build more roads in the parks. In North Carolina, Horace Kephart, a reclusive writer, and George Masa, a Japanese immigrant, launch a campaign to protect the last strands of virgin forest in the Smoky Mountains by establishing it as a park. In Wyoming, John D. Rockefeller Jr. begins quietly buying up land in the Teton Mountain Range and valley in a secret plan to donate it to the government as a park.

<dd>&#149;<b>Episode Five, Great Nature (1933-1945)</b> To battle unemployment in the Great Depression, Franklin D. Roosevelt creates the Civilian Conservation Corps, which spawns a "golden age" for the parks through major renovation projects. In a groundbreaking study, a young NPS biologist named George Melendez Wright discovers widespread abuses of animal habitats and pushes the service to reform its wildlife policies. Congress narrowly passes a bill to protect the Everglades in Florida as a national park the first time a park has been created solely to preserve an ecosystem, as opposed to scenic beauty. As America becomes entrenched in World War II, Roosevelt is pressured to open the parks to mining, grazing and lumbering. The president also is subjected to a storm of criticism for expanding the Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming by accepting a gift of land secretly purchased by John D. Rockefeller Jr. Special features: The National Parks: This is America. Mini-documentary.

In Florida, Lancelot Jones, the grandson of a slave, refuses to sell to developers his family's property on a string of unspoiled islands in Biscayne Bay and instead sells it to the federal government to be protected as a national monument. In the late 1970s, President Jimmy Carter creates an uproar in Alaska when he sets aside 56 million acres of land for preservation, the largest expansion of protected land in history.

<dt><b>Darwin's Nightmare</b></dt>
<dd>Documentary film that exposes the poverty and misery of people living on the shores of Lake Victoria in Tanzania who are dependent upon fishing the Nile perch from the lake for their meager earnings. The fish are exported by air to Europe to be sold cheaply and the planes that arrive to transport the fish at first seem to arrive empty, but turn out to carry weapons to Africa and fish away.<br>
"Some time in the 1960's, in the heart of Africa, a new animal was introduced into Lake Victoria as a little scientific experiment. The Nile Perch, a voracious predator, extinguished almost the entire stock of the native fish species. However, the new fish multiplied so fast, that its white fillets are today exported all around the world. Huge hulking ex-Soviet cargo planes come daily to collect the latest catch in exchange for their southbound cargo? Kalashnikovs and ammunitions for the uncounted wars in the dark center of the continent. This booming multinational industry of fish and weapons has created an ungodly globalized alliance on the shores of the world?s biggest tropical lake: an army of local fishermen, World bank agents, homeless children, African ministers, EU-commissioners, Tanzanian prostitutes and Russian pilots."

<dd>Lachung and Lachen are two unique villages in the remote alpine region of North Sikkim.

It not only regulates the realm of social life, but is also instrumental in maintaining a balance with nature. It is clear that survival in the mountains is intricately linked with nature, and the prudent realization that, unless strictly regulated, the bounty of nature would deplete, makes the villagers implement the rules rigorously. 2002. 26 min. <b>DVD 7323</b><br></dd>

<dd>Welcome to Alang, India, the site of a gargantuan scrap yard where ocean-going ships come to die. Forty thousand Indians live and work here, dismembering and scavenging the hulks of 400 vessels every year. This documentary chronicles the daily lives of the people who work here, the barefoot men who take apart giant mountains of steel by hand, piece by piece, as they spend months toiling sun-up to sun-down destroying ship after ship. It is the world's most unregulated industry. Ship owners rarely bother to abide by the UN Base Convention, which bans shipments of transboundary waste. One worker a day, on average, dies on the job, from gas explosions, falls or from tons of falling steel. Still one in four will contract cancers caused by asbestos, PCBs or other toxic substances. 2005. 46 min. <b>DVD 5647</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>Our Vanishing Wilderness</b></dt>
<dd>40 years ago, a small crew of filmmakers set out to document some of the more pressing issues involving wildlife in America. They made eight half-hour films around the country--it ended up being the first environmental tv series in the US. Shot in 1969, the issues weren't new, but hadn't been handled much yet on television--the medium had yet to embrace the environmental movement. Our Vanishing Wilderness was a landmark program for National Educational Television and public broadcasting (pre-PBS). The material in it pre-dates the first Earth Day, but definitely reflects the nation's growing interest at the time in pollution and environmental issues. Some of the material is dated, and often speculative. The series has an obvious bias, but it's simultaneously quaint and incisive, and particularly of its era. The footage of animals in the wild is spectacular; the tone of the program unflinching. It was a necessary step in the development of environmental media, and it took another few decades for the next tv series on the issues to arrive. Our Vanishing Wilderness started as a book. Created by husband and wife team Shelly Grossman, nature photographer, and Mary Louise Grossman, nature writer, it was a kind of hybrid: part environmental report, part natural history, and part nature photography coffee table book. OVW was noted as a most 'worthwhile expose on the environment' in Time Magazine in 1971.<br></dd>

<dt><b>The Tragedy of the Commons</b></dt>
<dd>Compares the failures of the commons with the mounting pressures of overpopulation to contrast ecological considerations with the self-interests of society. Directed by Hawert Kennedy and Paul Preuss. "The tragedy of the commons is a type of social trap, often economic, that involves a conflict over finite resources between individual interests and the common good. It states that free access and unrestricted demand for a finite resource ultimately structurally dooms the resource through over-exploitation. The term derives originally from a comparison noticed by William Forster Lloyd with medieval village land holding in his 1833 book on population.[1] It was then popularized and extended by Garrett Hardin in his 1968 Science essay "The Tragedy of the Commons."[2] However, the theory itself is as old as Thucydides[3] and Aristotle. Such a notion is not merely an abstraction, but its consequences have manifested literally, in such common grounds as Boston Common, where overgrazing required the Common no longer be used as public grazing ground."
