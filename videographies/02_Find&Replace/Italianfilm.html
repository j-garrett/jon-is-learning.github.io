<dt><b>Le Bal</b> (Italy | France | Algeria, 1983)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Ettore Scola. Cast: Christophe Allwright, Aziz Arbia, Marc Berman, Regis Bouquet, Chantal Capron, Liliane Delval, Martine Chauvin, Francesco De Rosa, Rossana Di Lorenzo, Etienne Guichard, Raymonde Heudeline, Arnault LeCarpentier, Olivie Loiseau, Nani Noel, Jean-Claude Penchenat, Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Perrier, Anita Picchiarini, Fran&ccedil;ois Pick, Genevieve Rey-Penchenat, Danielle Rochard, Monica Scattini, Michel Toty, Michel van Speybroeck. Le Bal takes place in a hypothetical Parisian dance hall and its plot is communicated entirely through mime, its pop music soundtrack and period ballroom dances. The prologue section, set in present time, introduces viewers to the cast of characters. The music begins and in a series of flashback sequences that use key moments in modern French history as their backdrop, viewers are presented with a clever yet poignant social commentary of prewar, postwar and modern times. 107 min. <b>DVD X4394</b></dd>

She visits a psychic seer who tells her she must follow the sex trade in order to be happy. Not long after she meets her eccentric and sexy neighbour, Suzy, who, by all counts appears to be a high class prostitute and encourages Juilet into sexual acts which make her guilty and nervous. A rare night when her husband is at home she wakes up to catch him talking to another woman on the phone. He calls out the name "Gabriella" while sleeping, but when she questions him he lies his way out of it. She finds out who Gabriella is and fears her husband will leave her. Juliet begins having visions who accuse and terrorise her. The pinnacle of the visions comes at the end where it is implied she realises she would be better off without her husband and is ultimately emotionally emancipated."

<dt><b>Hanging Shadows: Perspectives on Italian Horror Cinema</b></dt>
<dd>With its roots in the pulpy crime novels of the 1920s and 30s, Giallo cinema or Italian horror cinema, as it's more commonly known, first emerged in the late 1960s. Following the neo-realists, the giallo films represented a radical break with Italy's cinematic past. This documentary presents an informative historical overview of the giallo genre, exploring its genesis and chronicling the films, directors, and personalities that made up its golden age. Includes interviews with a fascinating group of filmmakers who redefined the horror genre and forever changed the way we think of horror films. Written, produced and directed by Paolo Fazzini.

<dt><b>Indiscretion of an American Wife, &amp; Terminal Station (Stazione termini)</b> (Italy / USA, 1954)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Vittorio De Sica. Cast: Jennifer Jones, Montgomery Clift, Richard Beymer. An American housewife vacationing in Italy reluctantly decides to put an end to her brief affair with an Italian academic. She flees to Rome's Stazione Termini, where she bids him farewell, but he begs her to stay. The troubled collaboration between director Vittorio De Sica and producer David O. Selznick resulted in two cuts of the same film. De Sica's version, <i>Terminal Station</i>, was screened at a length of one-and-a-half hours, but after disappointing previews, Selznick severely re-edited it and changed the title to <i>Indiscretion of an American Wife</i> without De Sica's permission. Both versions of this controversial release are presented here. Dialogue by Truman Capote. pecial Features: Exclusive audio commentary on Indiscretion by film scholar Leonard Leff (Hitchcock and Selznick: The Rich and Strange Collaboration of Alfred Hitchcock and David O. Selznick) ; original theatrical trailer ; promotional materials. Indiscretion of an American wife (72 min.) / Selznick's cut, including the Patti Page-performed overture "Autumn in Rome" and "Indiscretion" -- Terminal Station = Stazione termini (89 min) / De Sica's original version 72 min., 89 min. <b>DVD 1851</b></dd>

<dt><b>Ladri di Biciclette (Bicycle Thief; Bicycle Thieves )</b> (1949)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Vittorio De Sica. Cast: Lamberto Maggiorani, Enzo Staiola. "The film tells the story of Antonio Ricci, an unemployed worker who gets a job posting flyers in the depressed post-World War II economy of Italy. To keep the job, he must have a bicycle, so his wife Maria sells her wedding sheets to get the money to get his bicycle from the pawnbroker. Early in the film, the bike is stolen, and Antonio and his son Bruno spend the remainder of the film searching for it. Antonio manages to locate the thief (who had already sold the bicycle) and summons the police, but with no proof and with the thief's neighbors willing to give him a false alibi, he abandons this cause. At the end of the film Antonio, desperate to keep his job, attempts to steal a bicycle himself. He is caught and humiliated in front of Bruno, but the owner of the bicycle declines to press charges, realizing that the humiliation is punishment enough. Antonio and his family face a bleak future as the film ends, coupled with Antonio's realization that he is not morally superior to the thief."

The film, which won a Special Jury Prize at the 1964 Venice Film Festival, is different from other cinematic depictions of the life of Christ in that there is no screenplay per se. Pasolini limited himself to the account by Matthew: only words written by the Saint are employed; no additional dialogue was written and only scenes described by Matthew are shown. Pasolini used no professional actors (his mother plays the older Mary) and he dedicated his film "to the dear familiar memory of John XXIII". 136 min. <b>DVD 1801; vhs 999:143</b></dd>

<dt><b>La voce di Pasolini</b></dt>
<dd>Pier Paolo Pasolini has a sacred, religious and arcane love towards the masses and, opposite this, a deep hate for the bourgeois. Thirty years has passed since his death, but his words, those he left in the form of verses, songs, stories, tales, films and interviews, even today contain authentic and sacred truths. It is through these words, still annoying, scandalous, atrocious, and sublime, that the authors of this documentary have decided to rediscover the historical value of this poet, of his message and life.
