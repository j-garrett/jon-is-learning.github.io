A performance by James Dean that helped to shape Beat manners and mannerisms. (Nicholas Ray's son, Tony Ray, appears in Cassavetes' Shadows.) <b>VIDEO/C 999:35 Media Center</b><br>
<center>

</center>
<b>The Cry of Jazz</b> (1958) Ed Bland. Film, black-and-white, sound; 35 minutes. An early definition of the distinctiveness of the black experience and its link to the aesthetics of jazz. Characteristically Beat in its somewhat romantic view of the black musician.<br>

<center>

<b>Jack Kerouac's Road: A Franco-American Odyssey</b> (1987), Hermenegilde Chiasson. Film, color, sound; 55 minutes. An unusual view of Kerouac entirely from the perspective of his French-Catholic background. An interesting corrective to the view of Kerouac as being rootless and culturally ungrounded.

<b>Huncke and Louis</b> (1995), Laki Vazakas. Video, color, sound; 10 minutes. A work in progress. A wonderful and disturbing portrait of Herbert Huncke and his companion Louis Cartwright. Wonderful and disturbing. The Beat generation with the bloom off. Cuts beneath the primping and preening of the movement, to document the human cost, as Huncke's work also does. Usefully compared with The Connection as a study of self-desturction through drugs and life-style.<br>
<b>New Orleans, 1938</b> (1995) Jerry Poynton. Video, color, sound; 12 minutes. Actor Edgar Oliver reads the Herbert Huncke's story, "New Orleans, 1938."<br>

<h2>III. THE BEAT SENSIBILITY IN FILM</h2>
</center>
<br>
<h3>CHRISTOPHER MACLAINE</h3>
<br>
<b>The End</b> (1953). Film, color, sound; 35 minutes. Set in San Francisco, a series of surreal episodes deal with suicide and death and the atomic age. <b>Media Center VIDEO/C 999:1598</b><br>
<b>Beat</b> (1958). Film, color, sound; 6 minutes. A boy and girl dance through the streets of a city. Reveals MacLaine's fundamentally choreographic sensibility.<br>
<h3>STAN BRAKHAGE</h3>
<br>
<b>Desistfilm</b> (1954). Film, black-and-white, sound; 7 minutes. Parker Tyler called it the first authentically Beat film (though the award might actually go to MacLaine's The End). Sexual combat and social anxiety among a group of young people.<br>
<b>Anticipation of the Night</b> (1958). Film, black-and-white, silent; 40 minutes. The quest for an innocent eye and a form of film that can capture the complexity of lived experience before it has been simplified by the understanding. <b>Media Center VIDEO/C 4917</b><br>
<h3>JONAS MEKAS</h3>
<br>
<b>Lost, lost, lost</b> (1949-1963/1976). Film, black-and-white and color, sound; 178 minutes. An exploration of terminal marginality, lostness, searching, longing. The first, chronologically, of Mekas' diary films-which capture the movements of time and space and mind into film. <b>UCB Media Ctr VIDEO/C 3979</b><br>
<b>Guns of the Trees</b> (1962). Film, black-and-white, sound; 75 minutes. Two couples-one white, one black-living on the margins. Ties in with Beat anxieties about the A-bomb and the point of work in American society. Narration by Allen Ginsberg. Not nearly as interesting or complex as Lost, Lost, Lost , but more obviously "Beat." Features Ben Carruthers, who also stars in Cassavetes' Shadows. <b>UCB Media Ctr VIDEO/C 4426</b><br>
<h3>FRANK PAINE</h3>
<br>
<b>Motion Picture</b> (1956). Film, color, sound; 4 minutes. The energy and freedom of traveling down the road in an automobile was one of the central Beat metaphors. Paine's mastery of space and time is usefully contrasted with Clarke's in her short films. While Paine lunges through space and eats it up, Clarke balletically dances around in it.<br>
<h3>SHIRLEY CLARKE</h3>
<br>
<b>Bridges Go Round</b> (1958), Film, color, sound; 4 minutes.<br>
<b>Skyscraper</b> (1959), Film, black-and-white, and color, sound; 20 minutes. A bebop sensibility. Clarke animates the city and its objects and makes them dance to her tunes.<br>
<b>The Connection</b> (1961). Film, black-and-white, sound; 103 minutes. From the Jack Gelber play, acted by The Living Theater. Waiting for Godot as a drug-pusher story. Because of some of its language, it was legally ruled obscene and only released after a court battle. <b>UCB Media Ctr VIDEO/C 999:893</b><br>
<b>Portrait of Jason</b> (l967). Film, black-and-white, sound; 105 minutes. Brilliant and disturbing. Jason is the archetypal hipster of the period, the psychopath Norman Mailer's essay "The White Negro" describes, condemned to swing forever. <b>UCB Media Ctr VIDEO/C 999:893</b><br>
<h3>ANDREW MEYER</h3>
<br>
<b>Shades and Drumbeats</b> (1964), Film, color, silent; 25 minutes. An all-nighter of drugs and sex with a group of young people. Compare with Shadows as an evocation of the milieu.<br>
<h3>JOHN CASSAVETES</h3>
<br>
<b>Shadows</b> (1957-1959). Film, black-and-white, sound; 87 minutes. Mixed races, questions of identity. Charlie Mingus and Shafi Hadi (a.k.a. Curtis Porter) perform on the soundtrack. <b>UCB Media Ctr VIDEO/C 4336</b><br>
<b>Too Late Blues</b> (1962). Film, black-and-white, sound; 103 minutes. Jazz milieu. A hero with a Peter Pan complex. Cassavetes tells the story of an artist too idealistic to function in contemporary capitalistic society. Is the problem society or him?<br>
<h3>ROBERT FRANK</h3>
<br>
<b>Pull My Daisy</b> (l959). Robert Frank and Alfred Leslie. Film, black-and-white, sound; 28 minutes. One of the best-known Beat films. Although for many years mistakenly believed to be improvised, the film still stands as a paean to spontaneity and freedom. <b>UCB Media Ctr VIDEO/C 4336</b><br>
<b>Me and My Brother</b> (1965-1968). Film, black-and-white and color, sound; 91 minutes. Peter and Jules Orlovsky, Christopher Walken, Joe Chaikin, Allen Ginsberg. Raises questions about the boundaries between art and life by forcing the viewer to wonder about what in the film is acted and what is not. <b>UCB Media Ctr VIDEO/C 999:2156</b><br>
<h3>RON RICE</h3>
<br>
<b>The Flower Thief</b> (1960). Film, black-and-white, sound; 75 minutes. Taylor Mead clowns and improvises his version of Chaplin in City Lights.<br>
<b>The Queen of Sheba Meets the Atom Man</b> (1963/1982). Film, black-and-white, sound; 109 minutes. Taylor Mead and Winifred Bryan, who has the most emotionally powerful passage-a ferry ride out into New York harbor. Film began by Ron Rice in 1963. After his death Taylor Mead completed the film between 1979 and 1982. <b>UCB Media Ctr VIDEO/C 999:1597</b><br>
<h3>VERNON ZIMMERMAN</h3>
<br>
<b>Lemon Hearts</b> (1960). Film, black-and-white, sound; 26 minutes. Taylor Mead house-hunting (and house-haunting) in San Francisco.<br>
<h3>KEN JACOBS</h3>
<br>
<b>Blonde Cobra</b> (1959-63) Film, black-and-white and color, sound with live radio; 30 minutes. Jack Smith camping it up in a work that hovers between the comic and the tragic. Where does role-playing end and reality begin?<br>
<b>Little Stabs at Happiness</b> (l959-63). Film, color, sound; 15 minutes. The dark side of the Beat sensibility. Kerouac regarded "goofing: -clowning around-as "holy," but Jacobs wanted to restore its blasphemous potential, and does so in this film.<br>
<h3>JACK SMITH</h3>
<br>
<b>Flaming Creatures</b> (l963). Film, black-and-white, sound; 45 minutes. A Sternbergian view of life as a form of theater. Relates to the Beat interest in costume and carnival, and the attempt to treat personal identity as a work of art. <b>Media Center VIDEO/C 3258</b><br>
<center>
<h3>COMING TO GRIPS WITH THE TRASH-HEAP OF CULTURE:<br>
FOUND FOOTAGE AND FOUND-OBJECT FILMS</h3>

<h3>MARIE MENKEN</h3>
<br>
<b>Go, Go, Go</b> (1962-64). Film color, silent; 11 1/2 minutes. Making space amid the hecticness and crush for privacy, consciousness, interiority.<br>
