<dd>A documentary exploring the legacy of McCarthyism on the Chinese American community. For the first time, Chinese American men and women who were hunted down, jailed and targeted for deportation speak out on how they and their friends were investigated and persecuted by government agents during the McCarthy witch-hunts of the fifties.

<dt><b>More to the Chinese Side.</b></dt>
<dd>"I used to think that we were the typical Asian American family," muses William Gow, a fifth-generation Chinese American of biracial descent, as several family members describe instances of how they are commonly mistaken for other ethnicities.
