<dt><b>Passionless Moments</b> (Australia, 1983)</dt>
<dd>Director, Jane Campion. A voice says, "There are 1,000,000 moments in your neighborhood; each has a fragile presence which fades almost as it forms." Ten such moments are dramatized, from a chubby man exercising and realizing that "sex" and "thing" go together to an ill, bored child discovering that most pieces of paper fit on top of a Scotties box. Along the way, a child races time, a matron thinks she hears a woodpecker, an unfaithful gay man wonders why his eyes can't focus on two depths simultaneously, Angela thinks about her uncle's pet pig as she eats pork, beer-drinking Ed recalls his school football days and vows to get back in shape, and a bachelor remembers his mother. 13 min. <b>DVD X6718; vhs 999:1330</b></dd>

<dt><b>Star Struck</b> (Australia, 1982)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Gillian Armstrong. Cast: Jo Kennedy, Ross O'Donovan, Margo Lee, Max Cullen, Pat Evison, John O'May, Ned Lander. Jackie Mullins rises from obscurity to win a rock contest at the Sydney Opera House. Her success unites the world of her ambitions and New Wave rock and the world of working class life in the Sydney Rocks where she works as a barmaid. This is an original blend of 'backstage' musical and working class comedy inflected by a popular feminism which displaces masculinity from the centre of Australianess as expressed in the rocker comedy. 94 min. <b>DVD X6153</b></dd>

<dt><b>The Tracker</b> (Australia, 2002)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Rolf de Heer. Cast: David Gulpilil, Gary Sweet, Damon Gameau, Grant Page, Noel Wilton. Set in 1922 in the outback, the story follows three mounted policemen and an Aboriginal tracker on a mission to bring to justice a black man accused of murdering a white woman. The party's leader is a sadistic racist known simply as the Fanatic. Their guide, the Tracker, is a resourceful and complex character, who keeps everyone guessing until the end. They are constantly half a day behind the Fugitive. Frustrations spill over as the tension mounts. Relationships among the pursuers are put to the test, and alliances shift among the men. Brutal acts are repaid. Law and justice are explored. 95 min. <b>DVD 4447</b></dd>

<dd>Directed by Geoff Murphy. Cast: Anzac Wallace, Bruno Lawrence, Wi Kuki Kaa, Kelly Johnson, Tim Elliot. Set in New Zealand against the bloody Maori Indian uprisings of 1870, Geoff Murphy's Utu is both a visceral adventure film and a devastating critique of British colonialism.
