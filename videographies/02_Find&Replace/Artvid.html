<dt><b>American Impressionists, American Realists: In Search of the New</b></dt>
<dd>In the midst of great social and technological changes between the Civil War and World War I, two groups of American artists stood out from the rest: the Impressionists and the Realists. This program combines archival footage and photographs, as well as images of the paintings involved, to portray this vibrant era in American history and art. 1994. 22 min. <b>Video/C MM711</b><br></dd>
<dt><b>American Visions</b> Written &amp; presented by Robert Hughes. 1997. 58 min each.<br></dt>
<dd>&#149; <b>The Republic of Virtue.</b> examines some of the first images made in America which resemble ancient ones. Jefferson and the founding fathers felt that classicism gave the young nation power and authority. In Washington, D.C. architects adopted and transformed the classical style to serve a new, democratic ideal. Hughes explores the work of artists and architects, Benjamin West, John S. Copley, Charles W. Peale, Thomas Cole and Charles Bulfinch. <b>Video/C 4775</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>The Promised Land.</b> Early settlers in the "Promised land" strive to carve out an identity in a virgin land while in the West, Spanish missions use art to convert the natives. In the East, plain Protestant settlers are suspicious of art's pleasures while in Virginia, an exiled aristocracy, strives to recreate its ideal of England. <b>Video/C 4776</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>The Wilderness and the West.</b> As majestic primal America fosters the idea of landscape as God's fingerprint, landscape painting holds deep religious and patriotic connotations. Soon, the belief in Manifest Destiny is embodied in art. Traveling from Yellowstone to the Hudson Valley, Hughes explores the artists Thomas Cole, John Audubon, Albert Bierstadt, John Gast, Currier &amp; Ives, Emanuel Leutze, George Catlin, Frederick Church, Frederic Remington, Thomas Noran and William Jackson. In their work he finds the conflicting impulses to worship the land and to conquer it, to create a myth of the West just as the frontier is closing. <b>Video/C 4777</b><br>
<br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>The Guilded Age.</b> Examines the many sides of America in the 19th century: the extravagant mansions of Newport's tycoons, the triumph of the Brooklyn Bridge, the haunting realism of Civil War photography, and the artistic creations of John Singer Sargent, James Whistler, Mary Cassatt, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, Thomas Eakins, John Peto, Winslow Homer, John Robling, Louis Sullivan,Isabella Stewart Gardner, and Bernard Berenson. <b>Video/C 4778</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>A Wave From the Atlantic.</b> Waves of immigrants in the early 20th century bring both their old culture and a thirst for the new. The tenements are documented by photographer Jacob Riis and the socially conscious Ashcan School. Then, after the historic 1913 Armory show, artists like Joseph Stella, Paul Strand, Alfred Stieglitz, forge a modernism that is uniquely American. Also presents the work of Robert Henri, George Bellows, Marcel Duchamp, Charles Demuth, Arthur Dove, Georgia O'Keeffe, Mabel Dodge Luhand, Marsden Hartley and Frank Lloyd Wright. <b>Video/C 4779</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Streamlines and Breadlines.</b> Examines the mythic images of the 1920's and 30's as skyscrapers rise in New York and the rural heartland is idealized by Regionalists like Thomas Hart. Artists of the WPA celebrate the worker as hero, while Jacob Lawrence tells stories of black America, and ambitious New Deal projects like Hoover Dam project self-confidence in hard times. Also examines the work of Raymond Hood, Edward Hopper, Stuart Davis, and Grant Wood. <b>Video/C 4780</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>The Empire of Signs.</b> After the post-war era, Hughes traces the development of abstract expressionism and the life of Jackson Pollock, and explores how artists as different as James Rosenquist, Claes Oldenburg, Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman, David Smith, Willem De Kooning, Robert Rauschenberg, Romare Bearden, Joseph Cornell, Andy Warhol and Jasper Johns reacted to the new consumer culture. <b>Video/C 4781</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>The Age of Anxiety.</b> This final segment explores how American art has reflected the upheavals of the last 25 years. Hughes traces the evolution of abstract art and minimalism and considers the spiritual richness of earth works, in which nature is the artist's medium. He ends the series by profiling a wide range of contemporary artists including Edward Kienholz, Donald Judd, Richard Serra, Walter De Maria, Robert Smithson, Bruce Nauman, Richard Diebenkorn, Philip Guston, Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons, Susan Rothenberg, Eric Fischl, Louise Bourgeois and James Turrell. <b>Video/C 4782</b><br>

<dd>Artists Nancy Holt and Robert Smithson, a married couple until Smithson's death in 1973, filmed their 1969 discussion of contrasting lifestyles and approaches to artistic creation.

<dd>Featuring film footage and slide images of artists Robert Smithson, Michael Heizer and Nancy Holt as they visited California's Mono Lake in July of 1968, this piece was edited by Holt in 2004. Mono Lake candidly captures the young artists as they explore the haunting landscape of one of the oldest and most distinctive lakes in North America. Heizer and Smithson are heard reading facts about the unique ecology, geology and natural phenomena of this alkaline lake; filmed against images of the beauty of the lake's natural environment. A "home movie" of the artists' 1968 road trip, and an intimate view of three seminal figures in the earth art movement as they interact with the Western landscapes that are so central to their work.

<dd>Holt's terrain is her Aunt Ethel's home in New Bedford, Massachusetts, presented in still images and excerpts from letters to the artist from her aunt. Holt pays particular attention to her aunt's story of aging, altering the images by "underscanning" them, a technical process that compresses the edges of the video image, building an intrinsic limitation into the tape: the compression of time and personal history represented by the images and narrative. This process echoes Holt's reading, slightly distorting and compressing the information in the letters as she presents them.

<dd>&#149;<b>Europe on the Brink</b></dd>

This program studies the continent's march to war as depicted in the photographic record commissioned by French banker Albert Kahn. Early color images and film footage explore a range of themes -- including contrasts between urbanization and rural life in France, Germany and Scandinavia, the decline of the Ottoman Empire and its impact in Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece and Macedonia; and the grittiness of everyday life in Europe. kahn's pacifism is also a topic. 51 min. <b>DVD X5709</b><br></dd>

This program traces his team's expeditions into Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine as Western powers redrew the map of the region. The French takeover of Syria, the Balfour Declaration, and Turkey&rsquo;s war with Greece come to life in Kahn&rsquo;s street-level films and autochromes-- which also serve as reminders that Jerusalem, like many other Middle East locations, suffered greatly during World War I. 52 min. <b>DVD X5713</b><br></dd>

Viewers discover Vietnam through its beggars, Tet celebrants and elegantly dressed Mandarin administrators; Cambodia, through its dancers and the imposing Angkor City complex; Japan, through rapidly Westernizing homes, dress and hairstyles; and India, through pictures of the maharajahs and other authorities rendered powerless by British rule. 51 min. <b>DVD X5714</b><br></dd>
