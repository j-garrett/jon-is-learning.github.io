<dt><b>Year Zero: The Silent Death of Cambodia</b></dt>
<dd>The first complete report of the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge and the devastating affects of US bombing in Cambodia during the Vietnam War. Year Zero was 1975, the end of the secret US bombing campaign against the Viet Cong that saw 100,000 tons of bombs dropped over Cambodia, and the emergence of the Khmer Rouge party as a ruling force. That year saw the desertion of the capital of Phnom Penh and the displacement of some 2.5 million people, the majority of whom would soon go missing. Pilger explores the roots of the US bombing campaign that began in 1969, contrasting it sharply with powerful footage of sick and starving Cambodians and interviews with relief workers with UNICEF and the Red Cross as well as imprisoned members of Pol Pot's regime. Produced and directed by David Munro; reported by John Pilger; edited by Jonathan Morris. 52 min. <b>DVD 8405</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>Bangkok Girl</b></dt>
<dd>This tragic documentary provides a glimpse into Thailand's notorious and booming sex tourism industry through the experiences of a 19-year-old bar girl named Pla. Working in the bars from the age of thirteen, Pla has managed to avoid selling her body--a remarkable revelation given her surroundings--but her refusal to take part in this all-too-common profession for young Thai women cannot last. The introduction of falangs, or foreigners, to Thailand has forever changed the city, the economy, the Thai people's lives and desires. A daring and unabashed look at a popular Western predilection through the eyes of one girl, this film challenges the accepted worldwide practice of sex tourism. Directed and written by Jordan Clark.

<dt><b>The Heroin Wars</b></dt>
<dd>&#149; Part 1, <b>The Opium Convoys.</b> Filmed over a 30 year period, this 3-part video examines the ongoing civil war and the burgeoning opium trade in Burma. The first segment begins in the 1960s when the Burmese Army seized power in a coup and the Shans began a war of independence. Opium was the Shan farmers' only source of income and the guerillas began to take 10% of the crop as tax and transported it in convoys to Thailand to buy guns. And so a deadly alliance was born. In the 1970s, as part of Richard Nixon's war on drugs, the U.S. joined in an all-out attack on the convoys in union with the Thai police. Lo Hsing-Han, the first "King of Opium" was arrested but the opium trade continued under the second "King of Opium", Khun Sa. 60 min. 1996. <b>Video/C 5296</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; Part 2, <b>Smack City.</b> The second segment moves to Hong Kong, which has been the drug capital of South-East Asia for a century. In Hong Kong opium was sold under a government license until the end of WWII when Britain enforced the UN treaty against narcotics. In the 1960s Hong Kong's suppliers and addicts switched from the relatively innocuous opium to the more addictive heroin because it was easier to smuggle and consume.
