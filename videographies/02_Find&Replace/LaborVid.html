<dd>&#149; <b>A Job at Ford's.</b> Just before the advent of the Great Depression, Henry Ford controlled the most important company in the most important industry in the booming American economy. His offer of high wages in exchange for hard work attracted workers to Detroit, but it began to come apart when Ford hired a private police force to speed up production and spy on employees. After the depression hit in 1929, these workers faced a new, grim reality as unemployment skyrocketed. <b>DVD X1162 [preservation copy]; Video/C 3171</b></dd>

<dd>&#149;<b>The Road to Rock Bottom.</b> As the Great Depression progressed economic collapse took its toll on rural America. Crops went unsold, farm mortgages were called in by banks, hungry farmers protested, and robberies increased dramatically. The U.S. Army was called in to defend the nation's capital from veterans who were demanding that President Hoover and Congress pay a bonus for their services in World War I. The film ends with Franklin Roosevelt's landslide election to the presidency. <b>DVD X1163 [preservation copy]; Video/C 3172</b></dd>

<dd>&#149;<b>New Deal/New York.</b> In his first one hundred days in office, in a effort to stem the effects of the Great Depression, President Roosevelt created many new federal agencies giving jobs and relief to people and transforming the American landscape with public works projects. Nowhere was this transformation more apparent than in Mayor Fiorello La Guardia's New York City. Together Roosevelt and La Guardia expanded and redefined the role of government in the lives of the American people. <b>DVD X1164 [preservation copy]; Video/C 3173</b></dd>

<dd>&#149; <b>We Have a Plan.</b> By 1934, as the nation grappled with the Great Depression, challenges to the New Deal from both sides of the political spectrum began to appear. Despite new government programs unrest was increasing especially in California, where the socialist, Upton Sinclair, ran for governor promising to turn idle land and factories into self-governing cooperatives. Sinclair's campaign ended in defeat, but one year later President Roosevelt's signing of the Social Security Act signaled America's emergence as a modern welfare state. <b>DVD X1165 [preservation copy]; Video/C 3174</b></dd>

<dd>&#149;<b>Mean Things Happening.</b>In the American democracy of the 1930's two visions of liberty collided as working men and women battled landowners and factory managers for the right to join a union. On the tenant farms and in the steel factories working people asserted their citizenship in the midst of great economic turmoil and a tide of government reform. <b>DVD X1166 [preservation copy]; Video/C 3175</b></dd>

<dl>
<dd>&#149;<b>To Be Somebody.</b>Many Americans, struggling to survive the Great Depression, were determined to help build a better America through direct action in the courts, in the Congress and in everyday life. At a time when lynchings, segregation, and anti-semitism were commonplace, black heavy-weight champion, Joe Louis became a symbol of national strength. In very different ways Louis and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt challenged America to live up to its promise of justice and opportunity for people of every race and faith. <b>DVD X1167 [preservation copy]; vhs Video/C 3176</b></dd>

<dd>&#149;<b>Arsenal of Democracy.</b>By 1939 Americans were still struggling to end the Great Depression. Their dreams of peace and prosperity were celebrated at World's Fairs in New York and San Francisco, but prosperity did not come in peacetime. Millions fled the "dust bowl" states to finally find work in new defense industries. While the New Deal changed America forever, it was war that ended the Great Depression. <b>DVD X1168 [preservation copy]; vhs Video/C 3177</b></dd>

<dt><b>Maid in America</b></dt>
<dd>An intimate look into the lives of three Latina immigrants working as nannies and housekeepers in Los Angeles, three of the nearly 100,000 domestic workers living in that city today. Judith hasn't seen her four daughters for the two years since she left Guatemala, but hopes to give them a better future by sending half her income back home. Telma, from El Salvador, has cared for the now six-year-old Mickey since he was a baby, essentially becoming his 'mom' so his mother can keep her career on track. Eva, one of the thousands of college-educated immigrants who have fled Mexico's unstable economy, is attending night school to improve her skills, and views housekeeping as a necessary transition.These women's stories vividly reveal how immigrants are redefining their roles, and underscores the vital role they play in many American households. The issue of worker's rights is introduced in the film through Dynamic Workers, a collective of women who have formed their own business to provide job security and benefits, and Domestic Workers Association, a support organization providing information and advocacy. Produced &amp; directed by Anayansi Prado. 2004. 58 min. <b>DVD X2389; vhs Video/C MM507</b></dd>

<dt><b>Phantom of the Operator.</b></dt>
<dd>This delightful found-footage film reveals a little-known chapter in labor history: the story of female telephone operators' central place in the development of global communications. Presents more than one hundred clips from rarely seen industrial, advertising and scientific management films produced in North America between 1903 and 1989 by Bell and Western Electric, transformed into a dreamlike montage documentary. As the first agents of globalization, this invisible army of women offered a way for companies to feminize and glamorize what was a highly stressful, underpaid and difficult job. Not merely 'Voices with a Smile,' telephone operators were test pilots for new management systems, and the face of shrewd public relations campaigns. As the work of operators has been eclipsed by the advent of automated systems, this artful piece of labor history also offers an insightful comment on women's work, industrialization and communications technology.

<dt><b>Type/caste: A Secretary with a Camera</b></dt>
<dd>Although the early 20th century "working girl" epitomized independence and modernity, by the end of the century the "secretary" had become the symbol of female subservience. This innovative documentary was shot and edited over a period of several years by a secretary working in downtown San Francisco. Loosely structured as a "day in the life" of a secretary, the film is a funny and compelling look inside the traditional female role in the American workplace. The film effectively interweaves narration, information on the history of clerical workers in the United States, interviews, the voices of secretaries, and provocative music, poetry, and performance to create a multilayered and highly discussible filmic essay that will stimulate thought and debate in a wide variety of courses in women's studies, labor studies, sociology, psychology, and American studies.

<dt><b>[Lemlich, Clara] Clara Lemlich: A Strike Leader's Diary</b></dt>
<dd>On November 22, 1909, New York City garment workers gathered at Cooper Union to discuss pay cuts, unsafe working conditions and other grievances.

Clara Lemlich, a flegling union organizer, thus launched the "Uprising of the 20,000," when, two days later, garment workers walked out of shops all over the city.

<dt><b>H-2 Worker.</b></dt>
<dd>From WWI to the 1990s, 10,000 Caribbean men were chosen yearly by American sugar corporations to harvest sugar cane for six months in Florida under temporary "H-2" visas.

<dd>Lured by false promises and driven by desperation, thousands of Chinese and Filipina women pay high fees to work in garment factories on the pacific island of Saipan, the only U.S. territory exempt from labor and immigration laws.

Forty thousand Indians live and work here, dismembering and scavenging the hulks of 400 vessels every year.

<dd>A film by Chris Marker. From 1967 to 1976 Chris Marker was a member of SLON (the "Company for the Launching of New Works"), which was based on the idea that cinema should not be thought of solely in terms of commerce. 1967 was also the year an important strike broke out at Rhodiaceta, a textile plant in Besancon, France. Chris Marker and members of SLON visited the city to document the strike and the lives and attitudes of the workers. The film's most important moments are composed of conversations with workers and their wives who believe the working class is at the mercy of a system that would like them to remain powerless. And so it was that their local demands grew to questions about the larger political system. Originally produced in 1968. 39 min. Video/C 9871</dd>

<dt><b>Borinage (AKA Mis&egrave;&Atilde;re de Borinage)</b> (Netherlands, 1934)</dt>
<dd>Directors Joris Ivens, Henri Storck. "In 1933 Henri Storck, who was one of the leading figures of the Belgium film avant-garde, asked Joris Ivens to help him to make a film about the social consequences of the miners strike in the Borinage the year before. Arriving at this mine region Storck and Ivens forgot about aesthetics. As Henri Storck tells: " We stopped thinking about cinema and how to frame shots and instead bacame dominated by the irrepressible need to produce images as stark, bare, and sincere as possible to fit the cruel facts reality had thrown at us." In a sober style the film confronts the spectator with the misery of the miners; unemployed or exploited by the mine companies they were, with their families, expelled from their homes if they couldn't afford the rent. Ivens used the method of re-enactment to incorporate the miners strike of 1932 in the film."
