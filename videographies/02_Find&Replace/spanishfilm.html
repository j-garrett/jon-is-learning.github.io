<dt><b>Land Without Bread (Las Hurdes)(Terre sans pain)</b> (1937)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Luis Bu&ntilde;uel. "...Focuses on the Las Hurdes region of Spain, the mountainous area around the town La Alberca, and the intense poverty of its occupants. Bu&ntilde;uel, who made the film after reading the ethnographic study Las Jurdes: &eacute;tude de g&eacute;ographie humaine (1927) by Maurice Legendre, took a Surrealist approach to the notion of the anthropological expedition. The result was a travelogue in which the narrator's extreme (indeed, exaggerated) descriptions of human misery of Las Hurdes contrasts with his flat and disinterested manner. Although some film scholars describe it as a documentary, Land Without Bread is actually an early (some might say prescient) parody of the barely invented genre of documentary filmmaking, according to anthropologist Jeffrey Ruoff."

Summary A dark comic operetta about the wedding night of Margarida and the viscount of Alveleda. The action becomes more surreal and macabre as the film progresses. This odd film is a major representative of an even odder film genre: direct-to-celluloid opera. It was commissioned by the Portuguese master of style, director Manoel de Oliveira from composer Jo&atilde;o Paes. Musically, it ranges from 19th-century romanticism to popular, modernist and even "post-modernist" styles. Based on the work of &Aacute;lvaro Carvalhal. 95 min. <b>DVD X2148</b></dd>

Cast: Maria de Medeiros, Miguel Guilherme, Lu&iacute;s Miguel Cintra, M&aacute;rio Viegas, Leonor Silveira, Diogo D&oacute;ria, Paulo Matos, Jos&oacute; Wallenstein, Ruy Furtado, Carlos Gomes, Maria Joao Pires. In this symbolic film, all of the inhabitants of a Portuguese mental asylum suffer from religious delusions of one kind or another -- even the cynic who denies the value of any religions at all. One couple re-enacts the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden, a woman plays at being St. Teresa de Avila while another man thinks he's a character from a Dostoyevsky novel, and yet another claims to have in his possession a fifth gospel from the Bible. Each has a special message to impart about the meaning of life and religion. 136 min. <b>DVD X2150</b></dd>
