<dt><b>Who Owns the Body International Human Rights Conference(2000: University of California, Berkeley).</b></dt>
<dd>"Human dignity, human rights and the integrity of the body are abused by persons, institutions and governments around the world. The critical questions of State-sponsored torture and terror, repatriation of Native American remains and international trafficking in human organs will be addressed by scholars and human rights activists from the United States, Europe, Bosnia, Croatia, Chile and South Africa."<br></dd>
<dd>&#149;<b>Keynote Address: Modern Slavery and the New Abolitionists.</b> Keynote speaker: Judith Lewis Herman. Professor Herman of Harvard Medical School explores the trafficking of human beings for forced labor, marriage, domestic servitude, prostitution and incest as themost persistent, endemic, and invisible forms of slavery throughout the world. Most of the victims are women and children. This global market now involves some 4 million people per year and although this traffic is nominally criminalized, it effectively operates with impunity.<br></dd>
<dd>&#149;<b>The Body and the State.Panel 1: Witnesses from the Grave: Mass Graves and Communities of Loss.</b> Forensic resurrectionists: mass graves and the return of mortal remains / William Haglund. -- All that remains: the body in the aftermath of Srebrenica /Laurie Vollen -- Srebrenica 1995: a genocide / Amor Masovic.<br>

Reflections on pain and memories: Addresses memories that follow torture: experiences of grief, anger, and fragmentation of identity and the healing process necessary to regain wholeness. Recovery depends on working through the pain and memories in different levels and putting words to them.<br>
Tortured bodies without ancestors: Examines some of the ways terror and torture in South Africa resulted inthe death of the African family through an attack on traditional law and examines what occurs when the body is subjected to torture.<br>
Healing the individual, family and communities after thewar: Analyzes the use of deliberate terror inflicted upon the populace during the Yugoslav War. The emphasis is on how the destruction of communities and individuals is linked to manipulation and creation of powerlessness. The ethnic cleansing and war-rape were carefully designed to create terror among civilians and create millions of refugees. Refugees's experiences and the psychosocial consequences of uprooting are discussed in the context of massive traumatization and the learned helplessness model. 105 min. Video/C 7408<br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>The Body and the State.Panel 3: Saying goodbye: Grieving Communities</b> State terror and human dignity in a Guatemalan village /Beatriz Manz -- Rituals as community resources / James Kelly -- Lessons from the Stockton massacre /Wendy Walker-Moffat.<br>
State terror and human dignity in a Guatemalan village: One of the hundreds of villages destroyed by the Guatemalan military was Santa Maria Tzeja. Survivors experienced human rights abuses and in some cases years in refugee camps. This speaker tells of the rebuilding, healing and reconciling in the village as they cope with the past in order to build a dignified future.<br>
Rituals as community resources: Reviews the potentially powerful connection between official responses to disasters and ongoing "natural" community rituals. Offers as an example the coming together of Afro-American communities in Chicago after the homicides of young boys and the homicides of prostitutes. Such issues as racism, community pride, value for self-sufficiency, and religious beliefs we repart of the constraints and resources in moving beyond these two disasters.<br>
Lessons from the Stockton Massacre: A specialist in refugee emergency response addresses the situation in Stockton California when a young white man in 1989fired an automatic weapon into a schoolyard of children killing minority children and further traumatizing the Southeast Asian refugee community. 109 min.

Native and other bodies: Addresses the track record of NAGPRA (Native American Grave Protection and Repatriation Act) and also looks at objects other than human remains as a kind of "cultural body," thus looking at NAGPRA as an internally consistent whole.<br>
Native American remains and human rights: Despite the passage of NAGPRA Native Americans are still being confronted by scientists claiming a right to own or control dead Indian bodies in order to conduct experiments on them perpetuating a double standard which began with early North American exploration that treated Indian bodies as property, curios or archaeological artifacts while dead bodies and gravesof other citizens were protected by laws.<br>
Human remains and NAGPRA: The chief archaeologist of the National Park Service explains the procedures and requirements of NAGPRA that requires the repatriation of Native American human remains and other cultural objects in public museum collections and those recovered from federal lands.<br>
Bone courts and Native American sovereignty: Considers aproposal to establish a Bone Court -- a new federal judicial forum to hear and decide disputes over museum collections of human remains, repatriation, burial sites, research on bones and to protect native sovereignty. 180 min.

<dd>&#149;<b>Native American Indian Repatriation. Panel 2: Ishi and Kennewick Man: Science, Ethics, and Native Rights</b><br>
Kennewick Man: setting limits to NAGPRA / James C. Chatters -- History and repatriation of Ishi/ Orin Starn -- From performance to record: Ishi's music and speech / Irfa Jhacknis -- The humanity of Ishi / Karl Kroeber.<br>
Panel: Joseph Myers (Introductions), William Johnson(Moderator), James C. Chatters, Orin Starn, Ira Jacknis, Karl Kroeber, Karen Biestman (Discussant).<br>
Kennewick Man: NAGPRA was intended to return the remains of recent Native American dead to their nearest of kin but was not intended to hand over ancient human ossils to modern-day Indian tribes, yet that is howit is being interpreted by some. Much of the scientific community and American public feels ancient remains, which often cannot be linked to modern tribes, should not be summarily reburied for temporal political reasons. This talk addresses this conflict which came to a head with the case of the Kennewick Man, a ca. 9,500 year old skeleton.<br>
History and repatriation of Ishi: A small group from thePit River Tribe held a private ceremony last month to rebury Ishi, the last Yahi Indian. This paper offers one view of the campaign to repatriate Ishi and what it can tell us about anthropology, Native America, andthe politics of memory and identity.<br>
From performance to record: Ishi's music and speech: Between 1911 to 1914, T. T. Waterman and Alfred Kroeber recorded Ishi, his music and narration of stories. This talk examines the preservation of these recordings and their content.<br>
Humanity of Ishi: Historical evaluation of Ishi'sbehavior challenges judgments that reduce his role tothat of passive victim. Such reduction in fact is aninverse expression of the cliche of the "noble savage," and diminishes understanding of and respect for theunique individuality of Ishi's impressiveness as ahuman being. 153 min.

<dd>&#149; <b>Commodification of the Body. Panel 1: The Body in Question</b> Corpses for dissection, organs for transplant / Ruth Richardson -- On being good-as-dead in a world short of organs / Margaret Lock -- Who owns the donor body? / Lesley Sharp -- The brain and human death / Alan Shewmon.<br>
Panel: Nancy Scheper-Hughes (Introduction), Ruth Richardson, Margaret Lock, Lesley Sharp, Alan Shewmon, Laura Nader (Discussant).<br>
Corpses for dissection, organs for transplant: Considers the current world organ shortage in a long historical perspective and compares the procurement histories oforgans for transplant and corpses for dissection drawing disquieting parallels between them.<br>
On being good-as-dead in a world short of organs: Examines the concept of brain death and its viability as a diagnostic tool of "death," since new medical technologies have kept bodies "alive" for more than ayear after brain death has occurred. Increasing world-wide demand for organs for transplant and thedebate about giving legal recognition to "social death," highlights the urgency to clarify the way in which medical and bioethical professionals define death.<br>
Who owns the donor body?: In the past donor's identities have been anonymous but recently donor kin have asserted their rights to proclaim publicly the personal identities of organ donors through new memorial forms that circumvent professional involvement. This talk explores the conflicts that arise as lay versus professional parties assert competing claims upon the donor body and its parts and the means by which the former now circumvent the obstructionist strategies of the latter.<br>
The Brain and human death: Widespread confusion surrounds both the precise signification of "brain death," and the rationale for its purported equivalence with death. Here a neurologist reconsiders whether "brain death" is any longer conceptually viable or even pragmatically necessary. 184 min. Video/C 7412<br></dd>
<dd>&#149;<b>Commodification of the Body. Panel 2: Traffic in Bodies and Body Parts</b><br>
The medical triangle: India, surgery and the anthropology of transplant / Lawrence Cohen -- The right to sell a kidney: current practices and debate in Israel / Michael M. Friedlaender -- The bodyand commodity fetishism / Nancy Scheper-Hughes --Human rights violations at the Cape Town police mortuary / Rosemary Thandiwe Sitsheshe -- Personal accounts of organs and tissue theft / Linda Johnson --Kidney theft in a modern private hospital / Liliana Goffi.<br>
Panel: Guy Micco (moderator), Lawrence Cohen, Michael M.Friedlaender, Nancy Scheper-Hughes, Rosemary Thandiwe Sitsheshe, Linda Johnson, Lilian Goffi.<br>
Medical triangle: Reviews the history and sociology of organ procurement and transplantation in India focusing on the origins of the market in kidneys, the emergence of marked regions of kidney sales, the role of private hospitals and their funding, of politicians and bureaucrats and foreign agents of various sorts.<br>
Right to sell a kidney: A kidney transplant clinic in Jerusalem has been treating Arab and Israeli patients returning after buying kidneys abroad. These transplants, which are illegal in Israel, are discussed making a strong case for both the legalization of remuneration for kidney donation and also for strengthening the restraints on illegal transactions.<br>
Body and commodity fetishism: The global traffic inhuman organs, tissues and body parts -- from the living as well as from the dead -- is examined as an anthropological analysis of postmodern forms of human sacrifice disguised as a "donation," rendered invisible by its anonymity, and hidden under the medical rhetoric of "life saving" and "gift giving.".<br>
Human rights violations at the Cape Town police mortuary: A loophole in the South African Organ and Tissue Act has allowed some doctors to harvest tissues and organs without considering feelings of the next of kin, justifying their actions as motivated by the altruistic desire to "save lives.".<br>
Personal accounts of organs and tissue theft: Recounts the experiences of an American wife who donated her husband's organs upon physician's request to discover later that they have been sold by "body brokers" in Germany.<br>
Kidney theft in a modern private hospital: Recounts the theft of a kidney from a living patient in Argentina which occurred while she was being operated on for another medical condition. 184 min. Video/C 7413<br>
