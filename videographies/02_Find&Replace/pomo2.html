<dt><b>Willoughby Sharp Videoviews Vito Acconci</b></dt>
<dd>Willoughby Sharp conducts an informal interview with video artist and performer, Vito Acconci. (Purchased with Stuart and Gail Buchalter Fund for the Study of Contemporary Art) 1973 62 min. Video/C 5240<br></dd>
<dt><b>14 Americans: Directions of the 1970s</b></dt>
<dd>Featuring: Vito Acconci, Laurie Anderson, Alice Aycock, Scott Burton, Peter Campus, Chuck Close, Nancy Graves, Joseph Kosuth, Gordon Matta-Clark, Mary Miss, Elizabeth Murray, Dennis Oppenheim, Dorothea Rockburne, Joel Shapiro.<br>
Examines a diverse group of New York-based artists in order to record many of the most provocative works and ideas of the past decade. These artists created performances, sculptures, earthworks, tableaux, furniture, shaped canvases and more using unusual materials. In this "idea art," their focus is often as much social and psychological as artistic. c2000. 91 min. Video/C 9105<br></dd>
<dt><b>Applications.</b></dt>
<dd>A video performance by Acconci, which illustrates his unique engagement of conceptual art, performance and Body Art. In this piece a woman kisses Acconci's body, covering him in red lipstick traces. Acconci then rubs his body against another man (Dennis Oppenheim), transferring the stains onto him. (Purchased with Stuart and Gail Buchalter Fund for the Study of Contemporary Art) 1970. 20 min. Video/C 5158<br></dd>
<dt><b>Association Area.</b></dt>
<dd>As a document of early performance art, this tape details the process of orientating the body and self in space, providing a physical metaphor for the process of adjusting oneself in society. Blindfolded, with ears plugged, two men try to sense each other's movements to assume the same motion and bearing. An off-screen voice, heard only by the audience, gives directions that would help them attain their goal. (Purchased with Stuart and Gail Buchalter Fund for the Study of Contemporary Art) 1971. 61 min. Video/C 5207<br></dd>
<dt><b>Centers.</b>(1971)</dt>
<dd>The film was made by Acconci's using the video monitor as a mirror. As we look at the artist sighting along his outstretched arm and forefinger toward the center of the screen what we see is a sustained tautology: a line of sight that begins at Acconci's plane of vision and ends at the eyes of his projected double. The result turns the activity around: a pointing away from the filmaker at an outside viewer. (Purchased with Stuart and Gail Buchalter Fund for the Study of Contemporary Art) DVD 5362; also vhs Video/C 5206<br></dd>
<dt><b>Command Performance.</b></dt>
<dd>In this performance piece Acconci attempts to replace himself with the viewer. The artist lies on the floor and philosophizes, having the camera focus on his mouth throughout the performance, while the viewer is encouraged to take his place on an empty stool in a spotlight. Originally produced in 1974. 57 min. DVD 5364<br></dd>
<dt><b>Conversions.</b></dt>
<dd>A performance videotape by Acconci who is known for his use of gesture, ritualized action and the human body as performance object. In this 3 part film Acconci, in a dark room burns the hair off of his chest with a candle, then plays with the illusion of having female breasts. In Parts II and III, Acconci continues to play with gender illusions via manipulations of his own body parts. (Purchased with Stuart and Gail Buchalter Fund for the Study of Contemporary Art) 1971. 66 min. Video/C 5152<br></dd>
<dt><b>Face-off.</b></dt>
<dd>This film is an ironic collusion of private and public, of exposure and masking, a tense ritual wherein Acconci divulges and then censors his self-revelations. He turns on an audiotape of his own voice addressing himself and the viewer, recounting intimate details about his life. Whenever the material becomes too personal however, he tries to drown out his voice and prevent the viewer from hearing yelling "No, no, no, don't tell this!" He becomes increasingly agitated as the tape proceedes. (Purchased with Stuart and Gail Buchalter Fund for the Study of Contemporary Art) 32 min. Video/C 5243<br></dd>
<dt><b>Fresh Acconci.</b></dt>
<dd>Artists Paul McCarthy and Mike Kelley re-stage classic 1970s performance pieces by Vito Acconci, with a decidedly ironic Southern California sensibility. Based on videotapes by Vito Acconci: "Claim excerpts" (1971), "Contacts" (1971), "Focal point" (1971), "Pryings" (1971), and "Theme song" (1973). Originally produced in 1995. 45 min. DVD 5365<br></dd>
<dt><b>Pryings.</b></dt>
<dd>This documentation of a live performance at New York University, is a graphic exploration of the physical and psychological dynamics of male/female interaction, a study in control, violation and resistance. The camera focuses tightly on Kathy Dillon's face, as Acconci tries to pry open her closed eyes. Her body is a vehicle for a literal enactment of the desire for and resistance against intimate contact. (Purchased with Stuart and Gail Buchalter Fund for the Study of Contemporary Art). 17 min. Video/C 5154<br>
<br></dd>
<dt><b>The Red Tapes.</b></dt>
<dd>tape 1. Common knowledge -- tape 2. Local color -- tape 3. Time lag. Camera, Ed Bowes ; sound, Tome Bowes ; music, Charles Ives. Ericka Beckman, Ilona Granet, Richie O'Halloran, Kathy Rusch, David Salle, Michael Zwack. Considered to be Acconci's master work, this three-part epic is one of the major achievements in the video medium. Designed originally for video projection, the work is structured to merge video space--the close-up--with filmic space--the landscape. Acconci maps a topography of the self within a cultural and social context, locating personal identity through history, cultural artifacts, language and representation. Originally released in 1976. 142 min. DVD 5361<br></dd>
<dt><b>Seedbed.</b></dt>
<dd>A silent record of Acconci's performance art piece where he lay hidden underneath a gallery-wide ramp installed at the Sonnabend Gallery, masturbating while talking about his fantasies about the visitors walking above him on the ramp. Originally released in 1972. 10 min. DVD 5363<br></dd>
<dt><b>Three Adaptation Studies</b></dt>
<dd>Contents: Blindfolded catching -- Soap and eyes -- Hand and mouth. In these early film exercises, Acconci exhibits an almost childlike vulnerability that is at once comic and oddly affecting. In Blindfold Catching, a blindfolded Acconci reacts, flinching and lunging, as rubber balls are repeatedly thrown at him from off-screen. In Soap &amp; Eyes, he tries to keep his eyes open after dousing his face with soapsuds, resulting in a tragicomic clown face. In Hand and Mouth, he repeatedly forces his fist into his mouth until he gags. Dist.: <a href="http://www.eai.org">Electronic Arts Intermix</a>. 1970. 8 min,<br></dd>
<dt><b>Undertone.</b></dt>
<dd>One of Acconci's most compelling and controversial works, Undertone is a confrontational and coercive attempt to engage the viewer in an intimate, ultimately perverse relation with the artist as he expounds a masturbatory fantasy with the viewer as voyeur. (Purchased with Stuart and Gail Buchalter Fund for the Study of Contemporary Art). 1973. 37 min. Video/C 5210<br>

<dt><b>Baldessari Sings LeWitt</b></dt>
<dd>Seated and holding a sheaf of papers, Baldessari proceeds to sing each of Sol Lewitt's thirty-five conceptual statements to a different pop tune, after the model of Ella Fitzgerald Sings Cole Porter. What initially presents itself as faintly humorous, gradually becomes a struggle to convey Lewitt's statements through this arbitrary means.

<dt><b>I Am Making Art</b></dt>
<dd>In an ironic reference to body art, process art and performance, Baldessari challenges definitions of the content and execution of art-making. Performing with deadpan precision, he moves his hands, arms and entire body in studied, minute motions, intoning the phrase "I am making art" with each gesture, as if art were being created from moment to moment with each body movement.

What emerges is a portrait of a thoughtful, quietly rebellious artist who has influenced a large number of younger artists over the last twenty years, and who has clearly followed his own path in the exploration of the territory which he embarked upon in the late 1960's. 1990. 29 min.

In this program, Barney, Guggenheim curator Nancy Spector, and others deconstruct the Cycle's filming and subsequent translation into sculptural installations. 2003. 53 min. DVD 2804<br></dd>

<dt><b>From the Heart</b></dt>
<dd>This film explores twentieth-century art by women, focusing on nine of the thirteen artists whose works compose the Gihon art collection: Works by Women ( Lynda Benglis, Lynda, Nancy Chambers, Clyde Connell, Janet Fish, Janet, Hermine Ford, Dorothy Hood, Dorothy, Mary F. McCleary, Gael Stack, Dee Wolff). The artists provide the dialogue, about artistic techniques employed, family background, philosophy of art, self-criticism, and success. 1998? 57 min.

<dt><b>Mumble</b></dt>
<dd>A part of an ongoing video correspondence with sculptor, Robert Morris, this film brings together repeated scenes and gestures, featuring Morris and Jim Benglis, the artist's brother, and a narrative of irrelevant, confusing and often purposefully untrue statements. Although the viewer is inclined to accept Benglis' narrative as true, such trust is called into question by her statements about actions taking place off camera which cannot be verified. As Benglis' narration degenerates into a meaningless, repetitive pulse, Mumble disrupts the convenient fiction that the image presented on screen is complete unto itself. (Purchased with Stuart and Gail Buchalter Fund for the Study of Contemporary Art) 1972. 21 min. Video/C 5211<br></dd>
<dt><b>Now</b></dt>
<dd>Throughout this video, Benglis asks "Now?!" as she makes faces and sounds and even kisses her own image on a monitor. The word "Now" used here as both question and command focuses attention on the deceptive "real" time of video. As her first color tape, Benglis experiments with the effect of unnatural color, turning up the levels until the colors are very high and artificial, which again disperses the idea of video as an impartial or "direct" medium. 1973.

<dd>In three short exercises, Campus uses basic techniques of video technology and his own image to create succinct, almost philosophical metaphors for the psychology of the self. In the first "transition," he appears to stab himself in the back, climb through the rupture in his body, and emerge whole on the other side. In the second execise, Campus wipes his face with his hand and "erases" its surface--only to reveal another image of his face underneath. Finally in conclusion, he appears to burn the living image of his face (as if it were a photograph), leaving only blackness.

Sometimes the performers walk in front of the screen and become part of the audience; sometimes members of the audience become part of the movie, perhaps taking part in a screen test or providing a live homage to Warhol's Sleep.

<dt><b>The Great Mojado Invasion, Part 2 the 2nd U.S.-Mexico War</b></dt>
<dd>The video begins at the inception of a second U.S.-Mexico war. This time, contrary to history, Mexico is victorious. The nation-state as we currently know it has collapsed. The ex-U.S. of A. has been fragmented into a myriad of micro-republics loosely controlled by a multi-racial junta and governed by a Chicano prime minister appointed as El Gran Vato. "Spanglish" is the official language, treating the monolingual viewer as a "nomadic minority." Panicked by the "New Borders," Anglo militias desperately try to recapture the "Old Order." The "New Aztlan Regime" propagandizes itself by satirically depicting Anglos with the same stereotypes currently utilized against Latinos: a portrayal of dumb, lazy, violent, drug-taking lunatics who are demonized as "alien" invaders from outer space.

<dd>This itinerant performance/installation presented two "end-of-the-century saints" from an "unknown border religion", in search of sanctuary across the United States while gathering confessions on intercultural fears and desires. Designed as a theater of mythos and cultural pathologies, the "Temple" proposes a ceremonial space for the reflection on ethnic, racial, and gender prejudices. It is divided in three main areas: the "Chapel of Desires", displaying "El Pre-Columbian Vato" or "holy gang member" (performed by Roberto Sifuentes); the "Chapel of Fears", displaying "San Pocho Aztlaneca" (a "hyper-exoticized curio shop shaman for spiritual tourists," performed by Guillermo Gomez-Pe&ntilde;a), and an enigmatic funerary vignette composed by performance objects. Paintings of other "hybrid santos" hang from the walls, two "nuns" ("chola/nun" Norma Medina and "dominatrix nun" Michelle Ceballos) take care of the temple, and visitors can leave their "confessions"; the most revealing ones are incorporated into the installation soundtrack for future performances.

A board with five circular holes is placed in front of the camera. The holes are covered and uncovered to reveal five people enacting a set of activities that involves walking between five spots and turning in circles. A discussion takes place between the artist and several of the "performers" which addresses the various physicalities of the action: the experience of being on the ground, watching the actions take place through the prop, and through the playback monitor, as well as notions of scale, and the chance happenings that take place within any system.

Heizer and Smithson are heard reading facts about the unique ecology, geology and natural phenomena of this alkaline lake; filmed against images of the beauty of the lake's natural environment. A "home movie" of the artists' 1968 road trip, and an intimate view of three seminal figures in the earth art movement as they interact with the Western landscapes that are so central to their work.

<dt><b>Points of view: Clocktower</b></dt>
<dd>A video that originated with an installation at the Clocktower in New York in May 1974. In the installation, four monitors were placed facing out N,E,S,W at eye level in the center of the room. Four tapes, previously shot from the four windows through a static camera with a movable circular tube in front of the lens, were played back simultaneously on all four monitors, revealing passing circular glimpses of the world outside. So the outside was brought inside through video, and this inside 'looking' led to a recomposition of video (a double take) when the actual outside was confronted.

<dd>Holt's terrain is her Aunt Ethel's home in New Bedford, Massachusetts, presented in still images and excerpts from letters to the artist from her aunt. Holt pays particular attention to her aunt's story of aging, altering the images by "underscanning" them, a technical process that compresses the edges of the video image, building an intrinsic limitation into the tape: the compression of time and personal history represented by the images and narrative. This process echoes Holt's reading, slightly distorting and compressing the information in the letters as she presents them.

<dd>In this seminal exploration of the phenomenology of video as a mirror and as a "reality," Jonas, face-to-face with her own recorded image, performs a duet with herself in this classic early video. 1972. Video/C MM974<br></dd>
<dt><b>Glass Puzzle</b></dt>
<dd>This complex and enigmatic work, which is performed by Jonas and Lois Lane, explores female gestures, poses, the body and narcissism. Mirroring each other with synchronized movements as they perform as alter-egos, Jonas and Lane reference archetypal female gestures and poses from popular and traditional cultures. This evocative personal theater is a quintessential Jonas work with its idiosyncratic vocabulary of gestures, ritual and symbolism. 1973.

<dt><b>Mirage</b></dt>
<dd>Writes Jonas: "For Mirage, I made a film of drawing,again and again, images on a blackboard, and thenerasing them. I got an idea to use drawings, which Icalled "Endless drawings" after those described in theMelukean Book of the Dead, the tribal ritual book ofNew Guinea," which says that in order to go from oneworld to the next you must finish a drawing in sand." 1976. 31 min.

<dd>Contents: Video: Waltz / Joan Jonas (7 min., 2003) -- Interview (2003) -- Image gallery -- biography. In Waltz, a filmed performance piece created by the American artist Joan Jonas, she pays homage to 18th century French outdoor theater, incorporating mythology into the narrative alongside spontaneously occurring events.

<dt><b>Songdelay</b></dt>
<dd>Performed with a cast that includes Gordon Matta-Clark,Jonas choreographs a theater of space, movement andsound with the urban landscape of New York in afeatured role.

<dt><b>Volcano Saga: Iceland, 1985.</b></dt>
<dd>Based on the thirteenth century Icelandic Laxdaela Saga, this narrative reverie is a retelling of a medieval myth about a young woman whose dreams foretell the future. Shot in the dramatic natural landscapes of Iceland and in New York, this performance-based work uses ancient dream analysis as a starting point for a densely textured tale, in which the young woman's interpreter hears her dreams and sees their meaning. A surrealistic ambience is created by the use of multi-layered digital effects, ghostly overlays, other-worldly images and the mythical text. 29 min. Video/C 4680<br></dd>
<dt><b>Vertical Roll</b></dt>
<dd>Using the technique of a continuous vertical roll, Jonas constructs a theater of female identity by deconstructing representations of the female body. Using her own body as performance object and video as a theatrical construct, Jonas unveils a disjunctive self-portrait. As she performs in front of the camera-- masked, wearing a feathered headdress, or costumed as a belly-dancer--her feet, torso, arms and legs, subjected to the violence of the vertical roll, appear as disembodied fragments.

<dd>Story 1: Adanazio -- Story 2: R.R. -- Story 3: Stephanie -- Story 4: Shelia -- Story 5: Cathy -- Story 6: Diana -- Story 7: Ray -- Story 8: Karl. An exploration of the lives of New York City detectives consisting of 8 short stories. Although fictional, the teleplay relies on a composite of actual filmed accounts of hate crimes. Shot and edited in a highly textured visual style, the colors are subdued yet somehow garish, and the sound is deliberately just out of sync with the speaker's lips. Occasional static combines with jumps in the plot reminiscent of a television viewer flipping channels. The Wooster Group's first work conceived solely for video, they have achieved an imaginative commentary on the rise of hate crimes, Klan-based electoral activity and white supremacist attitudes in the United States.

<dt><b>Allan 'n' Allen's Complaint.</b></dt>
<dd>The influence of Jewish fathers on their sons and the complexity of familial relationships are explored in this witty, poignant portrait of two artists and their fathers. Beat poet, Allen Ginsberg, and performance artist/sculptor, Allan Kaprow, are the sons who struggle with and against the influences of these patriarchal figures. In this playful, often moving portrait of fathers and sons, the video artists Paik and Kubota subject their content to irreverent temporal, spatial and visual transformations: images multiply and proliferate, time is accelerated or slowed, and the audio is de-synchronized. 1982. 29 min.

<dd>Contents: Electronic moon, parts 2 and 3 (1967-69, 3 min., sd., b&amp;w and col.) -- Missa of Zen (1967, 3 min, si., b&amp;w and col.) Video art by Nam June Paik and Jud Yalkut recorded between 1967 and 1960, revealing some of Paik's earliest experiments with television and electronic imagery. In Electronic Moon, colorized images of the moon are accompanied by Glenn Miller's Moonlight Serenade. In Missa of Zen, a TV screen, filmed from an extremely oblique angle, appears as a ghostly sliver at the side of a darkened frame. Isolated in silence and darkness, the TV set slips into the realm of the "unheimlich." Situating mediated America at the crossroads of "missa" (Christian mass) and Zen Buddhism, Paik highlights the connnections between mass culture and the transcendental. Video/C MM1052<br></dd>

<dd>A silent celebration of heterosexual lovemaking. The artist's objective was to make an erotic film, from a woman's point of view, that was not pornographic, as well as to give an equal voice to women's eroticism. 1967. 18 min. Video/C MM451<br></dd>

<dt><b>Meat Joy.</b></dt>
<dd>"Meat Joy is an erotic rite -- an excessive, indulgent celebration of flesh as material : raw fish, chicken, sausages, wet paint, transparent plastic, ropes, brushes, paper scrap. Its propulsion is towards the ecstatic -- shifting and turning among tenderness, wildness, precision, abandon; qualities that could at any moment be sensual, comic, joyous, repellent. Physical equivalences are enacted as a psychic imagistic stream, in which the layered elements mesh and gain intensity by the energy complement of the audience. The original performances became notorious and introduced a vision of the sacred erotic." Converted from original film footage of three 1964 performances of Meat Joy in London, Paris and New York City. Dist.: <a href="http://www.eai.org">Electronic Arts Intermix.</a> 6 min. Video/C MM1060<br></dd>
<dt><b>Snow</b></dt>
<dd>An unedited documentation of the 1967 group performance, which was built out of Schneemann's outrage and sorrows over the atrocities of the Vietnam War. An ethereal stage environment combining colored light panels, film projection, torn collage, hanging sacks of colored water, "snow", crusted branches, rope, foil and foam was the set and setting in which an audience-activated electronic switching system controlled elements of the performance/installation. Performed January-February 1967 at the Martinique Theatre, New York. 17 min. Dist.: <a href="http://www.eai.org">Electronic Arts Intermix.</a> Video/C MM1227<br></dd>
<dt><b>Souvenir of Lebanon</b></dt>
<dd>Combines live color footage of Lebanese and Palestinian villages destroyed by Israeli bombing in 1982-1983, black and white stills of the damage re-shot from newspaper photos, and color slides of peaceful Lebanon from the Lebanese tourist bureau in New York. Souvenir of Lebanon is the video component for the kinetic sculpture War Mop; a flailing motorized mop rises on plexiglass cams and is dropped, slapping the video monitor every eight seconds. The sound on the video recorded layers of reverberation as the mop hit the monitor. Dist.: <a href="http://www.eai.org">Electronic Arts Intermix.</a> 1983. 6 min. Video/C MM1188<br></dd>
<dt><b>Viet Flakes</b></dt>
<dd>Short film without narration composed from a collection of Vietnam atrocity images, compiled over five years, from foreign magazines and newspapers. Schneemann uses the 8mm camera to "travel" within the photographs, producing a volatile animation. Broken rhythms and visual fractures are heightened by a sound collage by James Tenney, which features Vietnamese religious chants and secular songs, fragments of Bach, and '60s pop hits. Dist.: <a href="http://www.eai.org">Electronic Arts Intermix.</a> 1965. 7 min. DVD 9543<br></dd>

<dt><b>Gestures</b></dt>
<dd>A series of performance-based works in which Wilke faces the camera in extreme close-up and performs repetitive or durational physical actions.

<dd>Contents: Paul Ryan's Proto Media Primer (1970, 16 min.) -- Ira Schneider's Media Primer (1970, 23 min.) -- Michael Shamberg's Media Primer (1971, 17 min.) Raindance's Media Primers reflect the group's iconoclastic theories of television and video, and their engagement with alternative and mass media, pop culture and the counter-culture. The themes addressed -- media manipulation, the camera's role in modifying individual behavior -- illustrate their experimentation with the technological and conceptual underpinnings of 1/2-inch portable video. Paul Ryan's Proto Media Primer includes scenes of Abbie Hoffman awaiting the verdict from the Chicago 7 trial and ironic man-on-the-street interviews. Merging alternative video and mass media, Ira Schneider's Media Primer juxtaposes cultural indicators -- television commercials, news footage, and Portapak documentation of countercultural events such as the Altamount rock concert. In Michael Shamberg's Media Primer, rhetoric and gestures are skewered as he examines the political structure of alternative media. 56 min. Video/C MM1170<br></dd>
