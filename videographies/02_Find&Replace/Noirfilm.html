<dt><b>Beyond a Reasonable Doubt</b> (1956)</dt>
<dd>Director, Fritz Lang. Cast: Dana Andrews, Joan Fontaine, Sidney Blackmer, Arthur Franz, Philip Bourneuf, Edward Binns, Shepperd Strudwick, Robin Raymond, Barbara Nichols. Crusading publisher Austin Spenser wants to prove a point about the insufficiency of circumstantial evidence. Spencer talks his prospective son-in-law Tom Garrett into participating in a hoax, the better to expose the alleged ineptitude of conviction-happy DA. Tom will plant clues indicating that he is the murderer of a nightclub dancer, then stand trial for murder; just as the jury reaches its inevitable guilty verdict, Spencer will step forth to reveal the set-up and humiliate the DA. Somewhat surprisingly, Tom eagerly agrees to this subterfuge. Unfortunately, an unforeseen event renders their perfectly formed scheme useless. 61 min. <b>DVD X6039</b></dd>

After a train wreck sends art critic George Steele into a mental tailspin, he's fired from his job at a New York art museum. Seems unjust, until you learn there was no train wreck.

<dd>Directed by Lewis Allen. Cast: Edward G. Robinson, Nina Foch, Hugh Marlowe, Jayne Mansfield. Ambitious D.A. Victor Scott zealously prosecutes Ed Clary for a woman's murder.

Scott resigns as a prosecutor and enters private practice. He draws the attention of mob kingpin Frank Garland. Scott represents one of Garland's stooges on a murder rap and Scott, in a grand display of courtroom theatrics, wins the case.

Three different versions are presented in this collection since Orson Welles never completed a final cut of Mr. Arkadin, several edits of the film exist, in different languages, with different sequences, actors, narrative structures, and even titles.

<dt><b>Nightmare Alley</b> (1947)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Edmund Goulding. Cast: Tyrone Power, Joan Blondell, Coleen Gray, Helen Walker, Taylor Holmes, Mike Mazurki, Ian Keith. "Circus geeks &mdash; those lowdown human wrecks willing to bite the heads off live chickens for sensation-seeking crowds &mdash; aren't exactly au courant on the entertainment circuit these days, but there's a doozy in Nightmare Alley. Though he's only seen in shadow, his creepy image and maniacal laughter dominate this rarest of film noirs, unseen for many years in any format due to a rights problem. Set in a cheesy carnival, the film presents an unforgettable gallery of grotesques whose lives intertwine romantically, criminally, and, ultimately, fatally. There's a con-artist drifter (Tyrone Power), a phony mind-reader (Joan Blondell), her alcoholic husband (Ian Keith), a brutal strongman (Mike Mazurki), and an unscrupulous shrink (Helen Walker), all players in a dance-of-death, shadow-drenched scenario of infidelity, mayhem, and murder. The grim atmosphere, razor-sharp dialogue, and sordid doings are rendered in high studio style courtesy of waspish director Edmund Goulding, who worked with Garbo and Crawford; screenwriter Jules Furthman (To Have and Have Not); and Dietrich's cinematographer, Lee Garmes. The author of the source novel, William Lindsay Gresham, eventually committed suicide. You'll understand why when (if) you see the film." [Morris, Gary.

For the job only, he'll put his racism aside ... until moments away from the score, hatred erupts. In this film to obtain the edgy look desired by the director a rare filming technique was used: infrared photography. <b>DVD 2229; vhs 999:1843</b></dd>

<dt><b>Pickup on South Street</b> (1953)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Samuel Fuller. Cast: Richard Widmark, Jean Peters, Thelma Ritter. "Petty crook Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) has his eyes fixed on the big score. When the cocky three-time convict picks the pocketbook of unsuspecting Candy (Jean Peters), he finds a haul bigger than he could have imagined: a strip of microfilm bearing confidential U.S. secrets. Tailed by manipulative Feds and the unwitting courier's Communist puppeteers, Skip and Candy find themselves in a precarious gambit that pits greed against redemption, Right versus Red, and passion against self preservation. With its dazzling cast and director Samuel Fuller's signature raw energy and hardboiled repartee, Pickup on South Street is a true film noir classic by one of America's most passionate cinematic craftsmen."

<dt><b>The Seventh Victim</b> (1953)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Mark Robson; produced by Val Lewton. Cast: Kim Hunter, Jean Brooks, Tom Conway. During the 1940's, producer Val Lewton created a style of horror film that remains an important influence on the genre even today. His speciality: psychological terror, relying on the powers of his viewer's imagination. And nowhere is his hand more evident than in this mystery revolving around devil worship. When Jean Brooks disappears, her innocent sister (Kim Hunter) sets out to find her in the seamier regions of Greenwich Village. What she finds instead is a satanic cult with the intent of applying the title to her. 99 min. <b>DVD 4481; vhs 999:3101</b></dd>

<dt><b>While the City Sleeps</b> (1956)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Fritz Lang. Cast: Dana Andrews, Rhonda Fleming, George Sanders, Howard Duff, Thomas Mitchell, Vincent Price, John Barrymore, Jr., Sally Forrest, James Craig, Ida Lupino. "Bedridden Amos Kyne is owner and manager of media conglomerate Kyne Enterprises. Upon Amos' death, his son, the ineffective Walter Kyne, takes control of the business. Not wanting to do any of the work but retain the glory, Walter creates a new position - Executive Director - that person who effectively will become head of the organization. The heads of the three primary arms of the business - John Day Griffith (newspaper), Mark Loving (wire service) and Harry Kritzer (photographic service) - are those in line for the job, each who will do whatever he needs to for the appointment. Walter has decided that whoever of the three solves and reports the Lipstick Killings first will get the position. The Lipstick Killings are the murders of young women, the murderer who scrawls a note in lipstick at the murder scene after the fact. Pulitzer Prize winning author and reporter Edward Mobley is seen by most to be the real brains of the organization, although he has no desire for the top job. Although he initially will not get into the internal fight for the job, Ed, who has connections to the police department and has his own thoughts as to the psychological profile of the killer, decides to assist his old friend, John Griffith, in solving the case. In their quest, those involved do not hesitate to use the women in their lives - namely Nancy Liggett (Ed's fianc&eacute;e and Mark's secretary), Dorothy Kyne (Walter's wife), and Women's Affairs columnist Mildred Donner - in whatever manner they can."

<dt><b>Death of a Cyclist (Muerte de un ciclista)</b> (Spain / Italy, 1955)</dt>
<dd>Director, Juan Antonio Bardem. Cast: Lucia Bose, Alberto Closas, Bruna Corra, Carlos Casaravilla, Otello Toso, Julia Delgado Caro. Upper-class geometry professor Juan and his wealthy, married mistress Maria Jose, driving back from a late-night rendezvous, accidentally hit a cyclist and run. The resulting tale of guilt, infidelity, and blackmail reveals the wide gap between the rich and the poor in Spain and surveys the corrept ethics of a society seduced by decadence.<br>
"...with few exception, there was no genuine Spanish film noir up until the 1970s because of the lack of any indigenous hard-boiled urban crime fiction, the pressures of moral censorship and the politically motivated desire of the Spanish authorities to render any <i>policiaca</i> (urban police drama) serviceable to the authoritarian interests of the state." Despite this, many critics now argue that Death of a Cyclist nonetheless possesses many of the attributes of conventional film noir, in terms of boths aspects of its narrative construction and its evocative misen en sc&egrave;ne.

<dt><b>Rififi (Du rififi chez les hommes)</b> (France, 1955)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Jules Dassin. Cast: Jean Servais, Carl Mohner, Robert Manuel, Perlo Vita (i.e. Jules Dassin), Marie Sabouret, Janine Darcy, Claude Sylvain, Marcel Lupovici, Pierre Grassel, Robert Hossein, Magali Noel, Dominique Maurin. A suspenseful story of a successful jewel robbery engineered by an aging ex-con in which the four thieves betray each other. The film ends in an orgy of torture, murder, kidnapping and retribution. One of the greatest crime capers, it set the standard for all others that followed. Most notable is Dassin's exquisitely intense silent burglary sequence which runs nearly half an hour. "After making such American noir classics as The Naked City and Brute Force, blacklisted director Jules Dassin went to Paris and embarked on his masterpiece: a twisting, turning tale of four ex-cons who hatch one last glorious heist in the City of Lights. At once naturalistic and expressionistic, this melange of suspense, brutality, and dark humor was an international hit and earned Dassin the Best Director prize at the Cannes Film Festival."
