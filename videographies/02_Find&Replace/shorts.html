<dt><b>Aria</b> (1987)</dt>
<dd>Ten directors: Robert Altman, Bruce Beresford, Bill Bryden, Jean-Luc Godard, Derek Jarman, Franc Roddam, Nicholas Roeg, Ken Russell, Charles Sturridge, Julien Temple. Cast: Bridget Fonda, Elizabeth Hurley, Theresa Russell, John Hurt, Buck Henry, Beverly D'Angelo, Anita Morris. Ten of the world's best-known filmmakers contributed to this compilation film, each fashioning a short film inspired by an aria from a famous opera. The approaches vary broadly, from the playful abstraction of Jean-Luc Godard's segment, which illustrated Armide with exercising body-builders, to the more literal approach of Franc Roddam, who transports Tristan and Isolde's story to modern-day Las Vegas. A particular stand-out is Julian Temple's take on Rigoletto, which recasts Verdi as the accompaniment to a contemporary Southern California sex farce. Arias sung in Italian, French and German. 88 min. <b>DVD 3310</b></dd>

<dt><b>Cassandra</b> (Mexico | USA, 2008)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Mauricio Chernovetzky. Cast: Nelly Bablumian, Chaz Chilcote, Araceli Guzm&#225;n-Rico, Doug Purcell. On the edge of a rocky desolate Mexican border town is a makeshift bar and brothel called "Las Mujeres de Troya," whose only patrons are soldiers from the other side. Do&#241;a Hecuba, the bar's proprietress, routinely overlooks the preparations for the night shift. But this evening fate intervenes in the form of Agamemnon, a powerful General from across the border, who has sent for Do&#241;a Hecuba's uncorrupted, enigmatic daughter, Cassandra. Do&#241;a Hecuba's desperate pleas are powerless against Cassandra's mysterious and fateful volition, which compels her to submit to Agamemnon. Her decision to cross the border takes us beyond the barriers of the flesh to the very limits of perception. Based on Euripides' "The Trojan Women". 28 min. <b>DVD X7351</b></dd>

<dt><b>Colloque de chien (Dog's dialogue)</b>(France, 1977)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Ra&#250;l Ruiz. "Although this film is clearly a short at twenty minutes, it packs in more plot than most feature films. It does this through exposition which is aided by the lack of moving images. The majority of this film consists of slideshow like stills explained by an unseen narrator. By limiting the action to these still shots, Ruiz manages to force the viewer to focus on his carefully arranged images while at the same time economically moving the plot along."

<dt><b>The Colonial Friend (L'ami y'a bon)</b>(Germany / France, 2005)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Rachid Bouchareb. "Rachid Bouchareb's indelible and haunting short film The Colonial Friend is a muted, yet thoughtful and compelling true historical account of the 1944 massacre by the French army of indigenous African soldiers who sought to collect wages for their military service. Centered on a Cameroonian farmer, Abi, who, like many able-bodied indigenous men from colonized territories, leaves his family to heed the patriotic call for conscription into the French armed forces during the early 1940s as part of the nation's war campaign against the Germans, he serves with distinction during the war, fighting - and often dying - alongside French and colonized soldiers in the battlefield until he is captured and interned when France falls into the hands of the Germans. Eventually repatriated at the end of the war, Abi briefly returns to his family before rejoining his fellow Senegalese veterans to demand their unpaid wages at Camp de Thiaroye, a peaceful protest that soon turns deadly when the French army turns its armaments towards its own soldiers to force their evacuation from the military installation. Elegantly (and incisively) rendered in two-tone (black and red), pencil sketch animation, Bouchareb understatedly, but effectively presents a pervasive image of subtle, yet omnipresent division and differentiation that continues to surface despite the perpetuated myth of colonial assimilation and enlightened occupation."

<dt><b>The Creation of Woman</b></dt>
<dd>Directed by Charles F. Schwep. "A year after The Sword and the Flute, Merchant produced his first film, the 14-minute short The Creation of Woman. Made while he was working at the McCann-Erickson advertising agency, it was shot on the most meager of budgets, a mere $9,000 advanced by Charles Schwep, an acquaintance of the time, partner in the endeavor, and the film's director. At first Merchant considered starring in the film, but Schwep wanted a seasoned professional, and in something of a coup they engaged the celebrated Indian dancer Bhaskar Roy Chaudhuri for the leading role. The Creation of Woman begins with the story of the Hindu god Brahma, whose role as creator also encompasses the Christian account of Adam and Eve. The brief film is essentially a fable. After Adam calls on God to give him a female partner, Eve is created and Adam finds that he can neither live with nor without her. Photographed in bold colors (with costumes of red and gold set against a dazzling blue backdrop), Merchant's parable is set to music and dance, with Chaudhuri performing his splendidly sensual and athletic Dance of Shiva that in pantomime tells the story of man's beginnings. An arresting tour de force, the film seems relevant to Merchant himself, who selects the creation story for his theme as he creates himself as a filmmaker. The film was nominated in 1961 for an Academy Award for best theatrical short subject." [<a href="http://www.merchantivory.com/creationofwoman.html">Merchant/Ivory Productions</a>] 14 min.

<dd>Directed by Georgia Lee. "Tells the story of Alice, a Chinese-American teenager who finds her best friend Wendy hanging from a noose in the girls' restroom. Although first-time viewers of the film often ask if Lee's inspiration for "Educated" came from personal experience, the story is actually based on a memoir written for the Three Penny Review by Francie Lin about a young Taiwanese girl committing suicide after she failed her college entrance exam. Lee imbues "Educated" with a surrealistic "Clockwork Orange" meets "Joy Luck Club" sensibility. The film's highly stylized exploration of traditional Asian American generational crisis between parents with high expectations and their rebellious teens drifts between fantasy and reality."

<dt><b>For Life...Against the War</b></dt>
<dd>In 1967, with the Vietnam War escalating wildly, an invitation was issued to filmmakers to create works running under three minutes in protest against the accumulating carnage. The original organizers chose the rubric For Life, Against the War, and eventually compiled sixty films. Now, decades later, an invitation to protest yet another war seemed sadly urgent, inspiring the New York Film-Makers Cooperative to ring the clarion once "...Again." The response was overwhelming, with submissions from several generations of artists unified by a singular disgust for the war in Iraq and the foreign policy that perpetuates it. Compiled with works from the overtly angry to the formally forceful, For Life, Against the War boldly announces that artists can take a stand, again and again.

<dd>&#149;<b>Riding the Tiger</b>(1999)</dd>
<dd>A haunting and lyrical evocation of the hubris, despair and devastation of the American war in Vietnam.

<dd>A deeply affecting portrait of Stephen Moses, a young art student who was shot dead at a phone booth in a random shooting. The voices of the friends he left behind are heard as we see images of his art work in a posthumous exhibit.

Paris, gorgeously photographed in black-and-white, is the setting for cultural explorations ranging from the mundane to the sublime, as visitors trek from icon to icon, snapping the same photos, climbing the same steps, and at times experiencing the transformative wonder they came to find. 1991. 17 min. <b>DVD 9574</b></dd>

<dd>&#149;Volume 1/Disc 1: Contents: [I]. I [love] $ (1986, 140 min.) -- [2]. Beauty = Det schoonheid (1970, 21 min.) -- [3] Even stilte = A moment's silence = Un moment de silence (1960-63, 10 min.) I [love] money: New York, Geneva, Hong Kong and Amsterdam are major hubs of the world's economy. Great amounts of money circulate there, and whereas poverty is ubiquitous in the streets of New York, Geneva carefully protects its wealth behind impeccable facades. No one is unaffected by the myth of the all-powerful Dollar: the under-privileged struggle to survive talking about their unattainable dream, while businessmen, from the safe distance of their offices, lay down the tenets of the financial philosophy. Beauty: The dream world of a faschist spy named Beauty who destroys himself by attempting to impose a rigid working order on the world. The recurring themes of van der Keuken's work -- time, violence, the perception of reality -- are explored here with exceptional intensity. A moment's silence: One of John van der Keuken's first independent projects produced on an extremely modest budget. The coming and going of street traffic in Amsterdam slows and finally the city is immobilized. In the silence, short live sequences introduce simple poetic observations of a peaceful urban landscape. <b>DVD 6638</b></dd>

Eye above the well: Explores India's spiritual and economic condition, moving from the city to the countryside in the region of Kerala, as it focuses on the essence of that civilization. Captured without commentary by a gliding camera are a cacophony of distinctly nonwestern sights and sounds: the bustling city streets, the serene landscapes of the surrounding countryside, a family preparing for dinner, an elderly actor performing his mythological drama, a modest country moneylender traveling from village to village, young girls at their singing lessons. Lucebert, time and farewell: One of the greatest Dutch poets of the twentieth century, Lucebert was also a major painter who participated in the Cobra movement. This is van der Keuken's acclaimed triptych of three short films on Lucerbert produced in 1962, 1966, and 1994. Unanswered question: A didactic verse on the mechanic (or rather, organic) function of memory and therefore, also on cinema. On animal locomotion: An illustration of the human body in motion with music from the Dutch composer Willem Breuker. <b>DVD 6639</b></dd>

<dd>&#149;<b>Talking heads(Gadajace glowy)</b> (Poland, 1980)</dd>
<dd>In 1980, the late Krzysztof Kieslowski interviewed a number of ordinary Poles (born at various times over the preceding 100 years), asking them who they were and what they wanted from life. The results were assembled into this short film. What strikes one today, whether it is a sign of communist Poland at this time, or merely of Kieslowksi's own fascination with moral questions, is how sombre and serious most of the answers are: no-one says they want to sleep with a film star or make a quick million. It's also noticeable how similar the answers are, despite the great age difference of the participants. The best answer is fittingly the last one.

<dd>Director: Stan Harrington. Cast: David Carreno, Matt Marquez, Sebastian Eslava, Monique Barajas, Maria Forero. Ernesto Palacio, the foremost Latino writer, decides after 2 recent flops to open his latest play in a small theater in Hollywood rather than Broadway or the West End. With a desire to cross language and cultural boundaries with his Spanish language play, and in an attempt to reach the masses, he pushes the envelope even further by casting two non-actors in lead roles...one, a hugely popular, female pop singer and the other a world renowned, Colombian, bullfighter. Fireworks and jealousy amongst the cast lead to mayhem during the opening night performance and despite believing that everything happens for a reason, Ernesto's faith is pushed to the absolute limit by this latest disaster.

<dt><b>The Perfect Human (Det perfekte menneske)</b>(Denmark, 1967)</dt>
<dd>Directed, J&#248;rgen Leth. "Like Life in Denmark, Good and Evil, and Notes on Love, sensible anthropological study is apparently on the programme, and in Leth's award-winning breakthrough it assumes an elegant, highly amusing form. Spanning a period of 22 years these films revolve skittishly around human nature, and apart from the more documentary Life in Denmark, each has actor Claus Nissen as Leth's artful alter ego. Nissen and Maiken Algren are in an empty white room with only the essential props for each scene. A bed, bedding, a table, chairs. "We are going to see the perfect human being in action", we hear, and Leth's voice puts descriptive or puzzled words to the little actions the film exhibits: the man touches his face investigatively, fills a pipe, cuts his nails, and gets undressed, but he does peculiar things, too: he jumps as if he is weightless, snaps his fingers in strange ways, and dances with exaggerated movements and no music. "Today, too, I had an experience that I hope I shall understand in a few days' time", he ponders. The whole film is staged with great clarity in its picture compositions with several characteristic zooms to indicate the bodily parts of the perfect human being, and emphasis on the light, boundless nothingness of the room. The soundtrack reveals tones of a clarinet touching on the stylistically consistent visuals. At its premiere at the Carlton cinema The Perfect Human was shown before Jean-Luc Godard's La Chinoise."

<dd>"An amazing portrait of four male to female transsexuals, QUEENS AT HEART (1965) portrays a rare and poignant glimpse into pre-Stonewall transsexual life made by the Southeastern Pictures Corporation.

QUEENS AT HEART includes very early footage of drag balls in the New York area. The negative is lost and the only remaining print of this film was neglected and is now badly faded.

<dt><b>The Sword and the Flute</b></dt>
<dd>Directed by James Ivory. "James Ivory's second documentary, The Sword and The Flute, also dealing with schools of art, grew out of his experience in making Venice: Theme and Variations. Only here, instead of photographing works by the Italian masters, he has used superb examples of Indian miniature paintings. Ivory's intelligent script, narrated with feeling by Saeed Jaffrey, and accompanied by the music of Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan, traces the history of Indian miniature painting after the Moghul invasion as it develops into two principal schools, the Moghul (Muslim) and the Rajput (Hindu). The Moghul miniatures reflect an interest in historical events and the life of the court, while those of the Rajput emphasize otherworldly concerns, the yearning for transcendence, but both involve the viewer immediately in a world that is exotic and ravishing. Ivory is fascinated by the faces (and prominent eyes) of his figures, the garments they wear, and the sharply noted details of their surroundings: the figures seem almost to leap at the viewer. Compared to Venice, the dramas Ivory creates through the Indian scenes are tauter and give a greater sense of complexity, which comes in part from the tension in Ivory between his intellectual role as a close observer of culture and his intimate, empathetic response to the paintings' exceptional sensuousness and romantic feeling. The cameraman for the film was another USC cinema student, Mindaugis Bagdon, and his and Ivory's photography of the Indian miniatures proved so effective that Ivory would use the technique later, also with striking effect, in his film Hullabaloo Over Georgie and Bonnie's Pictures."

<dd>&#149;<b>Anno 1950:</b> Twenty years before the rise of 1970's hardcore films in the U.S., the commercial pornography produced by the French unleashed a new era of erotic cinema.

<dt><b>Workshop Exercises (Cwiczenia warsztatowe)</b>(Poland, 1987)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Marcel Lozinski. "In "Cwiczenia Warsztatowe",we see a documentary film crew filming views of Polish people on youngsters.A variety of answers are obtained as it is a question of honor of a communist society.There are some people who oppose all views about Polish youth.There are some people who present their frank views.We also get to see some people who refrain from speaking as they are afraid of expressing themselves in public.It appears from some scenes as if Polish people have some kind of fear which is preventing them from getting their voices heard.It is from some reactions that we can deduce that in the past there was some discipline in Polish schools.It is the older generation of Polish people that is extremely critical of young Poles.According to them Polish youth have a tendency to destroy everything.Marcel Lozinski films two views of the same reality.Is it a trick ? It might be a way to get closer to reality.It is shocking that no one knows a real answer to this question as the editing of the film was done neither with the knowledge of the participants nor without their approval."

<dd>Directed by Jeremiah Zagar. "Documentary becomes dream as artist Isaiah Zagar sits in a diner, reminiscing on his childhood as he draws a picture of a bird.

<dt><b>[Zager, Jeremiah]Paints on Ceiling</b></dt>
<dd>Directed by Jeremiah Zagar. "Sometimes, an entire lifetime is decided in a moment. At least it was for Isaiah Zagar, whose mother&#8217;s scream when he was three set him on the road to becoming an artist. In this striking, dream-like film, his son, Jeremiah reenacts the incident when his father had his epiphany: Letting his crayon stray outside the lines in the coloring book, to the formica kitchen table, then the floor, up the refrigerator and finally scrambling to the top of that appliance in order to color on the ceiling. When his mother walked in and saw her son teetering on the edge, her terrified cry convinced him that his destiny was to evoke similar reactions from others to his art. Now a famous Philadelphia mosaic and mural artist, Isaiah Zagar&#8217;s exploration of this moment offers extraordinary insight into the mind of a fascinating and complex man, the subject of his son&#8217;s first full-length documentary that won the Emerging Visions Award at its debut at the 2008 South by Southwest film festival."
