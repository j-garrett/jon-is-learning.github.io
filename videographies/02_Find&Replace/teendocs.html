<dd>A true-life chronicle of a group of kids growing up in the California suburbs in the 1980's, told through the films made by filmmaker Darren Stein between the ages of 7 and 15.

<dt><b>Understanding Hookup Culture: What's Really Happening on College Campuses</b></dt>
<dd>When it comes to intimacy and sex, young people today are apparently doing away with the old rules of romance and cutting straight to the chase. If recent reports are to believed, the rise of hookup culture on college campuses is in the process of killing off dating and courtship, radically altering some of our most basic assumptions about heterosexual sex and gender. But for all the speculation, there's been little beyond anecdotal evidence to back any of these claims up. This lecture by Stanford University's Paula England, a leading researcher in the sociology of gender, aims to clarify what's actually going on. England mobilizes a wealth of data--illustrated with highly accessible motion graphics--to begin to chart whether hooking up represents some kind of fundamental change, or whether we're simply seeing age-old gender patterns dressed up in new social forms.
