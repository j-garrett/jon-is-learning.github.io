<dt><b>Art 21 -- Art in the Twenty-First Century</b><br>
Created and produced by Susan Sollins, Susan Dowling; directors, Catherine Tatge, Deborah Shaffer.<br>
For most of us, "art" is what appears on walls, in sculpture gardens, on film or video or in installations. But for the artists themselves, art begins long before these artifacts take final form. For them, art is a process that involves observation, description, analysis, and synthesis. Art is about making ideas, concepts and visions into something tangible or visible, something to be experienced. "Art 21 -- Art in the Twenty-First Century" captures the exciting creative processes that precede the making. In segments dealing with "romance" or "protest," for example, we watch as artists describe their own thinking, their approaches to understanding those words. We see how thoughts are given form and marvel as materials are manipulated and modified. We watch works of art emerge. And we learn that common words can -- and should -- inspire works that trouble meaning and conventional wisdom. For making "art" more knowable and familiar, yet more individualized, more distinctive, and more personal, "Art 21 -- Art in the Twenty-First Century" receives a Peabody Award.<br>

<dt><b>China, Beyond the Clouds</b><br>
Directed by Phil Agland<br>
Filmmaker Phil Agland reveals the everyday drama and passion of contemporary China, a country "steeped in tradition and wracked by change," by focusing on life in one small town. Interwoven throughout the four segments of this documentary are the stories of a gang fight, in which one boy is killed, and the subsequent police investigation; a hill country teacher who leaves his charges temporarily in the care of a substitute while he takes a course to improve his skills; and the work of Dr. Tang who practices acupuncture and treats people with problems such as rheumatism and migraines as well as cerebral palsy. The blind masseuse treats the grannies' ailments and confides that she is in live with a blind pen pal. Although the focus is on the situation of children and youth in a changing world, the film does not ignore other elements of the community--the elderly, the entrepreneurs, the leaders of the "Street Committee," etc.--or the history and physical splendour surrounding this small town in China.<br>
