<dt><b>Land Without Bread (Las Hurdes)(Terre sans pain)</b> (1937)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Luis Bu&ntilde;uel. "...Focuses on the Las Hurdes region of Spain, the mountainous area around the town La Alberca, and the intense poverty of its occupants. Bu&ntilde;uel, who made the film after reading the ethnographic study Las Jurdes: &eacute;tude de g&eacute;ographie humaine (1927) by Maurice Legendre, took a Surrealist approach to the notion of the anthropological expedition. The result was a travelogue in which the narrator&rsquo;s extreme (indeed, exaggerated) descriptions of human misery of Las Hurdes contrasts with his flat and disinterested manner. Although some film scholars describe it as a documentary, Land Without Bread is actually an early (some might say prescient) parody of the barely invented genre of documentary filmmaking, according to anthropologist Jeffrey Ruoff."

<dt><b>The Glorious Sixth of June</b>(1934)</dt>
<dd>"A flimsy excuse for the kind of film-making fun, on-set and in the cutting room that nonetheless paid off in the Unit's increasingly confident handling of sound and picture. The film incidentally illustrates Cavalcanti's temperamental differences from John Grierson, and it inadvertently prefigures a modern pattern in British advertising whereby the brand is sent up at the same time as being promoted. The announcement of reduced GPO charges is hokily jokey and preceded by five minutes of amiable ribbing of studio feature films, stage melodrama, am-dram, the British Establishment, and stiff upper lips in general. It's all too O.T.T. to count as biting satire, but enlivened by Cavalcanti's low-cost experiments with the medium and plenty of gleeful mugging by the Film Unit staff who appear on-screen."

<dt><b>Our Friend the Atom.</b>(1958)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Hamilton Luske; Walt Disney Studios. "Our Friend The Atom...was produced by Disney in cooperation with the U.S. Navy and General Dynamics, builders of the nuclear submarine USS Nautilus. As a "Tomorrowland" segment of the Disneyland television show, Our Friend The Atom relates the history of atomic energy, beginning with a clip from the earlier film 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, which erroneously maintains that author Jules Verne predicted the use of atomic energy. The film then progresses to an animated fairy tale of a fisherman who finds a bronze bottle in his net. Opening the flask, the fisherman is confronted by a genie, who explains that after centuries of confinement, he has resolved to kill whomever opens the bottle. The fisherman feigns surprise that so large a being could fit into the bottle. The genie returns to the vessel to prove that it can be done, and the wily fisherman corks the bottle up. Finally, the genie relents and promises to grant the fisherman his wishes if the bottle is uncorked. Says the narrator, "The story of the atom is like this fable, come true through science. For centuries we have been casting our nets into the sea of the great unknown in search of knowledge. Finally, we found a vessel and, like the one in the fable, it contains the genie." In a combination of live-action and animation, Our Friend The Atom moves from this fairy tale premise to an international history of atomic energy that culminates in American control of the technology. To soothe public apprehension, atomic energy is explained in terms of common household items. An atomic reactor, the viewer is told, is just like a big furnace. An atomic chain reaction is likened to what happens when a stray ping-pong ball is thrown at a mass of mousetraps with ping-pong balls set on each one. The narrator relates that an atomic explosion might be like the angry genie, but with the nuclear reactor and the magic power to transmute ordinary materials into radioactive tools in science and medicine, "Here lies our chance to make the atomic genie our friend." The film ends with the prediction that "clean" nuclear reactors will replace grimy coal and oil power plants. Radiation will be used to produce better crops and livestock. People will zoom from place to place in atomic cars, trains, boats and planes. "Then, the atom will become truly our friend."" [From: Langer, Mark.

<dt><b>Victory Through Air Power</b></dt>
<dd>Directed by Perce Pearce, et al. Walt Disney Pictures. "The popular film maker Walt Disney read the book [by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_P._de_Seversky">Alexander de Seversky</a>] and felt that its message was so important that he personally financed the animated production of "Victory Through Air Power." The film was primarily created to express Seversky?s theories to government officials and the public. Movie critic Richard Schickel says that Disney "pushed the film out in a hurry, even setting aside his distrust of limited animation under the impulses of urgency." (The only obvious use of limited animation, however, is in diagrammatic illustrations of Seversky's talking points. These illustrations often feature continuous flowing streams of iconic aircraft, forming bridges or shields, or war material moving continuously along assembly lines.) It was not until 1945 Disney was able to pay off his 1.2 million dollar war film deficit."

<dt><b>How the Myth was Made</b></dt>
<dd>Documentary about the making of Man of Aran. Made for George Stoney's class at NYU in the Documentary Tradition in which Robert Flaherty's classic MAN OF ARAN was featured. It's twin purposes were to help students understand how documentary evolved from concepts very different from the cinema verit? or "fly on the wall" approach that has been dominant since changes in technology made the new approach possible from the early 1960's. It also serves as a reminder of the filmmaker's own impact on the places and people filmed and the responsibility the maker has to those filmed as well as to his audience. 60 min.

<dt><b>Moana: A Romance of the South Seas.</b></dt>
<dd>"Life and love in the South Seas... Robert Flaherty's famous travelogue." The rites, customs, and daily lives of the Samoan natives of Savaii Island, Western Samoa are depicted in this early 20th century ethnographic film. "In 1923, Jesse Lasky of Paramount offered Flaherty the opportunity to shoot a film anywhere in the world?so long as it turned out to be another Nanook. Flaherty, along with his wife and family, traveled to the village of Safune on the Samoan island of Savaii to record the traditional culture of a civilization which was rapidly changing and becoming westernized under British rule. The result was Moana: A Romance of the Golden Age. Shot in black and white on panchromatic film, Moana has an almost stereoscopic look?the figures seem solid and real and the colors of the island foliage appear as varying shades of silvery-gray. The film explores the lives of the lovely and gentle Samoans and culminates in a ritual tattooing. Although not on the same level as Nanook or some of Flaherty's later work, Moana was received with critical acclaim and popularity on its release. In fact, John Grierson coined the term "documentary" to describe the film. During the making of Moana, Flaherty, the independent filmmaker, had his first conflict with the studio system when Paramount insisted he cut the film for a slightly shorter running time."

<dt><b>The Bridge (De Brug)</b> (1927-28)</dt>
<dd>"The vertical lift-bridge is the object of study in The Bridge. Normally it seems to be a very static object, but Joris Ivens made a very dynamic film out of it. "For me, the bridge consisted of a laboratory of movements, tints, forms, contrasts, rythms and the relationship between all these phenomena". The film was immediately recognized as a masterpiece by international critics and colleague filmmakers; Joris Ivens was at once the most famous avant-garde filmmaker of the Netherlands."

<dt><b>Rain (Regen)</b> (1929)</dt>
<dd>Co-Directed with Mannus Franken. "A day in the life of a rain-shower. As a city symphony Joris Ivens films Amsterdam and its changing appearence during a rain-shower. A very poetic film with changing moods, following the change from sunny Amsterdam streets to rain drops in the canals and the pooring rain on windows, umbrellas, trams and streets, untill it clears up and the sun breaks through once again. Although it seems to be one day it took Ivens a long time to film what he wanted to film (for even in Amsterdam it doesn't rain every day). With The Bridge, Rain became his major breakthrough as an avant-garde film artist. In 1932 Joris Ivens asked Lou Lichtveld (who also made the music for Philips Radio) to make a sound version of it, and in 1941 the film inspired Hanns Eisler to compose his "Fourteen ways to describe rain" in the context of a 'Film Music Project'."

<dt><b>Farewell Topsails</b>(1937)</dt>
<dd>"Jennings made Farewell Topsails for the Adrian Klein/Dufay-Chromex company as one of three shorts designed to show how the process looked, the other two being a charming view of English rural life, English Harvest, and a negligible piece, possibly assembled from out-takes of English Harvest, titled The Farm (both 1938)." ... Farewell Topsails, cut to the jaunty sound of a sailor's accordion, and shot in the brilliant summer sunlight of 1937, records one of the last voyages of a commercial sailing ship carrying her cargo of extracted kaolin on a trip from Cornwall. There is not much that is obviously personal about the film, save for the fact that it recorded the passing of an ancient mode of technology in favour of an industrial mode - one of the grand themes of Jennings' unfinished work Pandaemonium."

<dt><b>Spare Time</b>(1939)</dt>
<dd>Producer, Alberto Cavalcanti. "Marvelously elusive war-time propaganda documentary that is both patriotic and mysterious. It is about the leisure activities of miners, steel-workers and cotton-mill employees, mostly musical. The scene that annoyed the social realists at the time was the kazoo band of the millworkers, who play Rule Britannia and produce an elevated tableau of the Britannia figure with her shield and trident. It is almost Andr? Kert?sz in its surrealism (Jennings was a member of the UK Surrrealist group). But the film is moving too in its trust in the people it presents, a trust tempered with strangeness, angularity and some kind of apprehension of darkness, as in the last shot of the miners descending in their cages. There is no war fever in it at all. It is almost the Blakean view of what it is to be English."

<dt><b>Words for Battle</b>(1941)</dt>
<dd>Narration: Laurence Olivier. "The first of four films that Lindsay Anderson considered Humphrey Jennings' best work, Words For Battle was described by the filmmaker himself as being "about the Lincoln statue in Parliament Square". This seems a curious definition for a documentary originally known as In England Now, which marries excerpts from major passages of English poetry and prose with footage of the contemporary, war-afflicted landscape, and in which Lincoln's statue only appears at the very end. But it makes sense of the whole trajectory of the film and of Jennings' underlying theme."

<dd>This program delves into Kahn's origins and formative years and the launch of his Archive of the Planet project. Topics include Kahn's Jewish ancestry and Alsacian upbringing; his early success in finance; his admiration of Japanese art and customs; the development of autochrome photography by the Lumi&egrave;re brothers; Marguerite Mespoulet's colorful documentation of Ireland's vanishing Celtic traditions; and Kahn's expedition to Cornwall and London with August Leon. 50 min. <b>DVD X5707</b></dd>

<dd>&#149;<b>Men of the World</b></dd>
<dd>In 1908, Albert Kahn and his chauffeur embarked on a global trek to observe and absorb other cultures -- an early "prototype' of the many photographic missions Kahn would fund over the years. this program illustrates that formative round-the-world trip as well as the 1913 journey undertaken by photographer St&eacute;phane Passet to China, Mongolia and India. Viewers will encounter startling images of early 20th century Manhattan, San Francisco, Tokyo and Beijing, as well as views of nascent Rio de Janeiro and burgeoning Buenos Aires. Scenes from Tsarist Siberia, the Mongolian steppes, a Varanasi teeming with worshippers, and a camel-and-elephant caravan on the Khyber Pass reaffirm the spectacular value of Kahn's grand project. 52 min. <b>DVD X5708</b></dd>

<dd>&#149;<b>Europe on the Brink</b></dd>
<dd>Poverty, emigration, declining birth rates, and ethnic divisions weakened many European countries as the 20th century began. From France to the Balkans, leaders prescribed nationalism and military buildup as the only solutions. This program studies the continent's march to war as depicted in the photographic record commissioned by French banker Albert Kahn. Early color images and film footage explore a range of themes -- including contrasts between urbanization and rural life in France, Germany and Scandinavia, the decline of the Ottoman Empire and its impact in Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece and Macedonia; and the grittiness of everyday life in Europe. kahn's pacifism is also a topic. 51 min. <b>DVD X5709</b></dd>

<dd>&#149;<b>The Soldiers' Story</b></dd>
<dd>As World War I engulfed his country, Albert Kahn struck a deal with the French army: his team of photographers would capture images and footage that helped the war effort in exchange for direct access to militarized zones. A century later, this program presents the results -- revealing the life and environment of the French soldier as recorded in Kahn's Archive of the Planet. The visual details of trench warfare and all its misery are combined with pictures from towns, hospitals , and barracks a few miles from the front -- evoking the humanity of the ordinary fighting man as well as the appalling devastation wrought by the era's instruments of death. 52 min. <b>DVD X5710</b></dd>

<dd>&#149;<b>The Civilians' Story: Albert Kahn's Archive of the Planet</b></dd>
<dd>In addition to documenting the Great War, Albert Kahn's team of photographers recorded the impact of the conflict on French civilian ife. This program explores both the propaganda value and the genuine emotional power in images of the war-torn French populace. French and Belgian refugees, ruined churches, and farms tended by women and the elderly are a few of the subjects rendered in exquisite and moving detail. Soissons smolders after a German retreat; Reims and its shattered cathedral hover on the edge of total destruction; and the Alsace region, Kahn's birthplace, regains its French identity. 52 min. <b>DVD X5711</b></dd>

<dd>&#149;<b>Europe After the Fire</b></dd>
<dd>Versailles, 1919: French banker Albert Kahn and his camera team are among the few photographers allowed inside the Hall of Mirrors for the treaty signing -- an example of Kahn's uncanny talent for documenting change. This program focuses on Kahn's pictorial record of the war's aftermath and the challenges of securing a true peace across Europe. Zeppelin-borne aerial footage conveys the scope of the destruction, while grave-digging and burial scenes evoke the staggering number of combatants killed. Other events and subjects include the influx of foreign workers that filled France's labor void; the French occupation of the Rhineland; German breadlines and Paris dance-halls; and war monuments in London and Verdun. 52 min. <b>DVD X5712</b></dd>

<dd>&#149;<b>Middle East, The Birth of Nations</b></dd>
<dd>No sooner had Europe declared an end to its Great War than the seeds of new conflict were sewn -- in the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire. With typical global awareness, photography archivist Albert Khan chose to document the historic changes occurring in the colonial Middle East. This program traces his team's expeditions into Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine as Western powers redrew the map of the region. The French takeover of Syria, the Balfour Declaration, and Turkey's war with Greece come to life in Kahn&rsquo;s street-level films and autochromes--which also serve as reminders that Jerusalem, like many other Middle East locations, suffered greatly during World War I. 52 min. <b>DVD X5713</b></dd>

<dd>&#149;<b>Far East, Expeditions to Empires</b></dd>
<dd>From 1914 through much of the 1920's, Albert Kahn's photographic team was hard at work in Asia, amassing culturally and historically vital images. This program recounts journeys through Indochina and greater Asia in which the Kahn team opened up a world most Europeans had never dreamed of. Viewers discover Vietnam through its beggars, Tet celebrants and elegantly dressed Mandarin administrators; Cambodia, through its dancers and the imposing Angkor City complex; Japan, through rapidly Westernizing homes, dress and hairstyles; and India, through pictures of the maharajahs and other authorities rendered powerless by British rule. 51 min. <b>DVD X5714</b></dd>

<dd>&#149; <b>The End of a World</b></dd>
<dd>As they built an unsurpassed visual archive of world culture, Albert Kahn and his photographers turned their attention to widely divergent locations. This program follows the maritime odyssey of Lucien Le Saint, circa 1922, as he captured on film the daily lives of Newfoundland cod fisherman, as well as expeditions into northwestern Africa. Images from Morocco and Tunisia focus on occupying French soldiers, the prostitutes they patronized, and larger changes in those societies, while pictures taken in Dahomey (now Benin) shed light on the symbiotic relationship between Catholocism and the Vodun religion. Viewers also learn about the Colonial Exhibition of 1931, Kahn's financial collapse, and the fate of his archive after his death in 1940. 51 min. <b>DVD X5714</b></dd>

<dd>In 1980, the late Krzysztof Kieslowski interviewed a number of ordinary Poles (born at various times over the preceding 100 years), asking them who they were and what they wanted from life. The results were assembled into this short film. What strikes one today, whether it is a sign of communist Poland at this time, or merely of Kieslowksi's own fascination with moral questions, is how sombre and serious most of the answers are: no-one says they want to sleep with a film star or make a quick million. It's also noticeable how similar the answers are, despite the great age difference of the participants. The best answer is fittingly the last one. [IMDB] 16 min. <b>DVD 4182</b></dd>

<br>Several years in the making and defiantly outspoken, this film stands as one of the most influential accomplishments of the collective of left-wing artist known as Frontier Films. Combining documentary form with staged reenactments, they created a treatise on the struggle for human rights in the 1930s couched in the doctrines of the political left. The film presents an emotional tour of the U.S. and its freedom-based ideologies, as well as an unflinching look at the forces threatening to undermine its strengths from within: Greedy capitalists, professional strikebreakers, and the Ku Klux Klan. 88 min. <b>DVD 7283 (Criterion); DVD 4669; also VHS Video/C 7026</b>

<dt><b>Daybreak Express</b></dt>
<dd>Pennebaker's first film. "I wanted to make a film about this filthy, noisy train and it?s packed-in passengers that would look beautiful, like the New York City paintings of John Sloan, and I wanted it to go with one of my Duke Ellington records, "Daybreak Express." I didn't know much about film editing, or in fact about shooting, so I bought a couple of rolls of Kodachrome at the drugstore, and figured that since the record was about three minutes long, by shooting carefully I could fit the whole thing onto one roll of film. Of course that didn't work since I couldn?t start and stop my hand-wound camera that easily so I ended up shooting both rolls and even a few more before I was through. It took about three days to film, and then sat in a closet for several years until I figured out how to edit it and make a print that I could show on a projector." [D.A.

<dt><b>Chronique d'un Ete (Chronicle of a Summer)</b> (1962)</dt>
<dd>" Paris. The summer of 1960. While war rages in Algeria and pre-independence Congo seethes with violence, ethnographic filmmaker Jean Rouch and sociologist Edgar Morin send two women out into the streets of the city to interview passersby. Rouch, whose previous groundbreaking films were shot in Africa, and Morin, an academic and writer, were experimenting with a new kind of documentary film about their own society that would reveal the innermost truth of peoples' lives. From a simple starting question - Are you happy, sir? - CHRONICLE OF A SUMMER delves deeper and deeper into the lives of its characters. They include Marceline, a Holocaust survivor; Angelo, who works grueling shifts in a Renault factory; Landry, a student from the Ivory Coast; and Marilou, a young, beautiful and deeply depressed Italian immigrant. As the film progresses, the light opening scenes give way to intimate revelations and hotly contested political arguments. CHRONICLE OF A SUMMER is a true landmark in film history. Rouch and Morin were among the first filmmakers to use hand held sync sound 16mm equipment. They also coined the term cinema verite to describe their approach, although their practice, placing people in situations and provoking responses, differs from what later came to be called verite films. Their use of the urban landscape and groundbreaking cinematography (cameraman Raoul Coutard was among the crew members working on the film) deeply affected the French New Wave and much of subsequent documentary practice. The film's self-reflexive structure, in which Rouch and Morin screen the film for the participants to critique it on-screen, as well as their own reactions to the critique, is still, amazingly, contemporary."

The second half presents reflections, particularly how patterns appear in water as it is moved by breezes or other small forces.

<br>Several years in the making and defiantly outspoken, this film stands as one of the most influential accomplishments of the collective of left-wing artist known as Frontier Films. Combining documentary form with staged reenactments, they created a treatise on the struggle for human rights in the 1930s couched in the doctrines of the political left. The film presents an emotional tour of the U.S. and its freedom-based ideologies, as well as an unflinching look at the forces threatening to undermine its strengths from within: Greedy capitalists, professional strikebreakers, and the Ku Klux Klan. 88 min. <b>DVD 7283 (Criterion); DVD 4669; also VHS Video/C 7026</b>

Music by Willem Breuker and others. Eye above the well: Explores India's spiritual and economic condition, moving from the city to the countryside in the region of Kerala, as it focuses on the essence of that civilization. Captured without commentary by a gliding camera are a cacophony of distinctly nonwestern sights and sounds: the bustling city streets, the serene landscapes of the surrounding countryside, a family preparing for dinner, an elderly actor performing his mythological drama, a modest country moneylender traveling from village to village, young girls at their singing lessons. Lucebert, time and farewell: One of the greatest Dutch poets of the twentieth century, Lucebert was also a major painter who participated in the Cobra movement. This is van der Keuken's acclaimed triptych of three short films on Lucerbert produced in 1962, 1966, and 1994. Unanswered question: A didactic verse on the mechanic (or rather, organic) function of memory and therefore, also on cinema.

Face value: Rejecting linear narrative storytelling, the director offers an epic of humanity and cultural diversity through a cartography of faces, the reflection of an imaginary Europe, made up of London, Marseilles, Prague, and the Netherlands. Mask: During the celebrations of the bicentennial of the French Revolution, Johan van der Keuken made a film about the revolutionary ideas of equality, liberty, and fraternity. Rather than focusing on the festivities, he lingers on the crowds in the metro and on the platform. Among them is a homeless member of the poor class who is ignored by his more affluent countrymen. A cutting perspective on the contraditions that permeate French society. <b>DVD 6640</b></dd>

Highlighted are the activities of Soviet children and youth of the Young Pioneers and Young Leninists interwoven with cinematic experiments as when Vertov charts the evolution of hamburger and bread by following its trail back to the farms and wheat fields from whence it came. An honest documentary of a society fresh from revolution, buoyed by idealism.

<dt><b>Taris, champion de natation (Taris, roi de l'eau)</b> (1931)</dt>
<dd>"The second of Vigo's four films is about 10 minutes long. The subject, allegedly, is a French national swimming champion, Jean Taris. First we see him swimming normally. Then we see a hint that this isn't a documentary short: Taris dives into the water, Vigo runs the film backwards, and Taris is spit back out. This happens 3 times. Thus the crux of the film: inventive (for the time) technique, while overuse of it occurs. Fun stuff, though: interesting shots of Taris doing the backstroke. Finally, we see him goofing around underwater; by this point, the movie achieves a genuine state of grace. Can be found on No. 10 of the New York Film Annex's video series of experimental and abstract films." [Internet Movie Database] <b>DVD X6356; DVD 3482 (non-US format DVD)</b></dd>

<dt><b>F is for Fake</b></dt>
<dd>This film-essay, done in a pseudo-documentary style is a meditation on illusionism, the role of the artist being that of a charlatan-magician. Portraits of art forger Elmyr de Hory (using footage from Francois Reichenbach's film) and Clifford Irving (forger of Howard Hughes' autobiography) intermingle with Welle's own connection with "fakes" -- Picasso paintings and his famous War of the Worlds radio broadcast.
