<dd>Directed by Ward Kimball. "...an episode of Disneyland which originally aired on December 28, 1955. It was directed by Disney animator Ward Kimball, and is about the Moon. It begins with a humorous look with Man's fascination with the Moon through animation. This segment features the Moon's usage in everything from William Shakespeare and children's nursery rhymes to lunar superstitions and scientific research. Then Kimball comes on with some information on the moon, supplemented by graphics. Kimball then introduces Dr. Wernher Von Braun, who discusses plans for a trip around the moon. Dr. Wernher Von Braun was employed as a technical consultant on this film by Walt Disney, and on a number of other Disney films [1].

<dt><b>Man in Space.</b>(1955)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Ward Kimball. "...an episode of Disneyland which originally aired on March 9, 1955. It was directed by Disney animator Ward Kimball. Later, it was edited into a featurette to play in theaters, accompanying Davy Crockett and the River Pirates. This Disneyland episode (set in Tomorrowland), was narrated partly by Kimball and also by such famed scientists as Dr. Willy Ley, Dr. Heinz Haber, Dr. Wernher von Braun and Dick Tufeld of Lost in Space fame. The show talks briefly about the lighthearted history of rockets and is followed by discussions of satellites, a practical look (through humorous animation) at what spacemen will have to face in a rocket (both physically and psychologically, such as momentum, weightlessness, radiation, even space sickness) and a rocket takeoff into space."

<dt><b>Mars and Beyond.</b>(1957)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Ward Kimball. "...an episode of Disneyland which aired on December 4, 1957. It was directed by Ward Kimball and narrated by Paul Frees. This episode discusses the possibility of life on other planets, especially Mars. It begins with an introduction of Walt Disney and his robot friend Garco, who provide a brief overview. It continues with an animated presentation about mankind seeking to understand the world in which he lives, first noticing patterns in the stars, and developing certain beliefs regarding the celestial bodies. Theories from scientists and philosophers are discussed, including Ptolemy's inaccurate, but formerly-accepted theories, as well as those of Copernicus. Life on other planets is considered, soon focusing on Mars. Ideas from science-fiction authors H.G. Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs are brought to life with more colorful animation. Pulp science fiction comics of the time are parodied in the same straightforward tone as everything else (this segment features Kimball's comic tone and there's even a cameo appearance by Donald Duck)."

<dt><b>Our Friend the Atom.</b>(1958)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Hamilton Luske; Walt Disney Studios. "Our Friend The Atom...was produced by Disney in cooperation with the U.S. Navy and General Dynamics, builders of the nuclear submarine USS Nautilus. As a "Tomorrowland" segment of the Disneyland television show, Our Friend The Atom relates the history of atomic energy, beginning with a clip from the earlier film 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, which erroneously maintains that author Jules Verne predicted the use of atomic energy. The film then progresses to an animated fairy tale of a fisherman who finds a bronze bottle in his net. Opening the flask, the fisherman is confronted by a genie, who explains that after centuries of confinement, he has resolved to kill whomever opens the bottle. The fisherman feigns surprise that so large a being could fit into the bottle. The genie returns to the vessel to prove that it can be done, and the wily fisherman corks the bottle up. Finally, the genie relents and promises to grant the fisherman his wishes if the bottle is uncorked. Says the narrator, "The story of the atom is like this fable, come true through science. For centuries we have been casting our nets into the sea of the great unknown in search of knowledge. Finally, we found a vessel and, like the one in the fable, it contains the genie." In a combination of live-action and animation, Our Friend The Atom moves from this fairy tale premise to an international history of atomic energy that culminates in American control of the technology. To soothe public apprehension, atomic energy is explained in terms of common household items. An atomic reactor, the viewer is told, is just like a big furnace. An atomic chain reaction is likened to what happens when a stray ping-pong ball is thrown at a mass of mousetraps with ping-pong balls set on each one. The narrator relates that an atomic explosion might be like the angry genie, but with the nuclear reactor and the magic power to transmute ordinary materials into radioactive tools in science and medicine, "Here lies our chance to make the atomic genie our friend." The film ends with the prediction that "clean" nuclear reactors will replace grimy coal and oil power plants. Radiation will be used to produce better crops and livestock. People will zoom from place to place in atomic cars, trains, boats and planes. "Then, the atom will become truly our friend."" [From: Langer, Mark.

<dt><b>Steamboat Willie</b>(Walt Disney Productions, 1928)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks. "Steamboat Willie (released on November 18, 1928), is an animated cartoon featuring Mickey Mouse. Contrary to claims by some sources, it wasn't the first cartoon produced to feature Mickey (Mickey starring in Plane Crazy was released, but not produced before Steamboat Willie and The Gallopin' Gaucho, although the latter was not distributed until after Steamboat Willie), but it was the one that made Mickey Mouse famous. Steamboat Willie was also the first sound cartoon to attract widespread notice and popularity." The cartoon was written and directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks; the title is a parody of the Buster Keaton film Steamboat Bill Jr. Music for Steamboat Willie was put together by Wilfred Jackson, one of Disney's animators (and not, as sometimes reported, by Carl Stalling), and comprises popular melodies including "Steamboat Bill" and "Turkey in the Straw".

<dt><b>Booby Hatched</b>(1944)</dt>
<dd>Winter. A duck struggles mightily, and finally hatches her eggs in the bitter cold, after candling them and seeing the chicks skiing, skating, and otherwise enjoying winter inside the shells. All but one, that is: poor little Robespierre. She doesn't notice until after the rest of the brood has gone swimming and Robespierre has sprouted legs and run off in search of warmth. He finds it, under a hibernating bear ("So I laid an egg"), but a wolf has followed him in and snatches the egg, with some help from a stick of TNT. What the wolf hasn't counted on is mama, who's right behind him, with a couple of eye-poking fingers at the ready. The wolf swaps a doorknob for the egg, and starts boiling the egg, but mama arrives in the nick of time only to be rejected by the baby, who was just getting warm. <b>DVD 8513</b></dd>

<br><b>Merrie Melodies</b>
<dl>
<dd>Merrie Melodies is the name of a series of animated cartoons distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures between 1931 and 1969. The sister series to Warner's Looney Tunes, Merrie Melodies were originally one-shot musical cartoon shorts before gradually featuring recurring characters. By 1944, no distinctions existed between the two series. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrie_Melodies">Wikipedia</a>] Originally produced by Harman-Ising Pictures, Merrie Melodies were produced by Leon Schlesinger Productions from 1933 to 1944. Schlesinger sold his studio to Warner Bros. in 1944, and the newly renamed Warner Bros. Cartoons continued production until 1963. Merrie Melodies were outsourced to DePatie-Freleng Enterprises from 1964 to 1967, and Warner Bros. Animation (now owned by Warner Bros.-Seven Arts) re-assumed production for the series' final two years.</dd>

<dt><b>Birdon</b>(2004)</dt>
<dd>Birdon is a depressed bird, who has been locked away in a cage for quite some time now. He seems ultimately bored as he has a very depressing look on his face. The only thing that really interests him, is the sky. He made a painting of it. One day Birdon can't take it anymore and out of frustration he starts pulling on the bars of his cage. It's a miracle! The door slams open and Birdon nearly falls out of it. He seems afraid of freedom at first, but then he gets a hold of himself and takes a flight through the skies. Nothing can stop Birdon's wings to take him anywhere he wants now, so it seems. A film by Alison Chieh Huang. <b>DVD X7037</b> DVD 6:1:2</dd>

Features 10 animated films by master Italian animator Bruno Bozzetto who tackles complex societal issues in short, witty, and wildly inventive animated episodes. <b>Baby story:</b> The miracle of procreation observed from within the woman's body. Sigmund: Requested for the Los Angeles Olympics back in 1984, this animated short shows the side effects that the television can cause on a very young viewer. <b>Grasshoppers</b>: View of world history and the part violence has played in that history with a humorous warning that grasshoppers might outlast us all. Academy Award nominee. <b>Striptease</b>: A very amusing spot created for a German TV programme dedicated to eroticism. <b>Self service</b>: Just like we exploit earth by extracting oil, so do mosquitoes behave over the human body by sucking our blood. <b>A life in a tin</b>: By restraining the whole cycle of life into just six minutes, the film underlines how our constant commitments often mislead us from the real meaning of life. <b>Big bang</b>: The consumption civilization regularly churns out a huge amount of wastes. How and where to dispose of them? Here comes a possible solution to the problem with its inevitable aftermath. <b>Dancing</b>: Optimism and a peaceful view of life can defeat even the biggest adversities. This one is the infallible formula employed by the film's protagonist to face the most cruel and merciless enemy of mankind. <b>Baeus</b>: An insect falls head over heels in love with a woman and he will do everything to cry out his love to her. <b>Mister Tao</b>: The peak of a mountain is generally just a destination and the end of a trip. For tiny peaceful Mister Tao, on the other hand it simply stands for a temporary stopover before he continues his research which may never come to an end. <b>DVD X2438</b></dd>

<dt><b>The Colonial Friend (L'ami y'a bon)</b>(Germany / France, 2005)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Rachid Bouchareb. "Rachid Bouchareb's indelible and haunting short film The Colonial Friend is a muted, yet thoughtful and compelling true historical account of the 1944 massacre by the French army of indigenous African soldiers who sought to collect wages for their military service. Centered on a Cameroonian farmer, Abi, who, like many able-bodied indigenous men from colonized territories, leaves his family to heed the patriotic call for conscription into the French armed forces during the early 1940s as part of the nation's war campaign against the Germans, he serves with distinction during the war, fighting - and often dying - alongside French and colonized soldiers in the battlefield until he is captured and interned when France falls into the hands of the Germans. Eventually repatriated at the end of the war, Abi briefly returns to his family before rejoining his fellow Senegalese veterans to demand their unpaid wages at Camp de Thiaroye, a peaceful protest that soon turns deadly when the French army turns its armaments towards its own soldiers to force their evacuation from the military installation. Elegantly (and incisively) rendered in two-tone (black and red), pencil sketch animation, Bouchareb understatedly, but effectively presents a pervasive image of subtle, yet omnipresent division and differentiation that continues to surface despite the perpetuated myth of colonial assimilation and enlightened occupation."

<dd>Directed by Adam Elliot. Adam looks back, with affection, to his childhood in a small suburban house, with his mum, his crippled and alcoholic dad, their bird Jeanette, and his older brother, who wears an eye patch, has asthma, and gets blamed for things even when he's not around.

<dd>Directed by Adam Elliot. Adam remembers his uncle. He had a hardware store, made a spider out of a pipe cleaner for Adam, had no kids and became sort of a surrogate parent to the lad. Adam's aunt commits suicide, but his uncle is not lonely, thanks to his dog Reg, his lemon tree, meals he shapes into smiley faces, good cups of tea, an incinerator, playing Santa on Christmas, and occasional visits from religious missionaries. Things start to go downhill for uncle, though, with the sudden death of Reg, and life ends in a nursing home, where Adam occasionally goes to visit. 6 min. Included on <b>DVD 3986</b></dd>

<dt><b>Felix the Cat</b></dt>
<dd>Created by Otto Messmer. "The first animated character that attained superstar status (and was anthropomorphic) during the silent era was the mischievous Felix the Cat, in Pat Sullivan Studios. He was inspired by Kipling's The Cat That Walked By Himself in the Just So Stories published in 1902. Originated by young animator Otto Messmer, the (unnamed) cat's first two cartoons were the five-minute Feline Follies (1919) and Musical Mews (1919), when Felix was known only as "Master Tom." Feline Follies was a segment of the Paramount Magazine, a semi-weekly compilation of short film segments that included animated cartoons. By the third Felix cartoon, The Adventures of Felix (1919), Felix took his permanent name. For the first few years, the Felix cartoons were distributed by Paramount Pictures, and then by M.J. Winkler. Messmer directed and animated more than 175 Felix cartoons in the years 1919 through 1929. Felix was the first character to be widely merchandised. The last Felix the Cat cartoon, The Last Life (1928), was due to the advent of the talkies and the success of Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse. Messmer continued with his comic strip (begun in 1923) until 1966." [<a href="http://www.filmsite.org/animatedfilms.html">Tim Dirks - filmsite</a>]</dd>

The brilliant Czech animator, Berthold Bartosch, created each of the films 45,000 individual frames working alone for two years to create the first serious, poetic, tragic work in animation. Based on a book of woodcuts by Frans Masereel; music by Arthur Honegger; electronic instrument by Martenot (Perhaps the first use of an electronic instrument in a film)" <b>Video/C 4425</b></dd>

<dt><b>Liquid Tales</b></dt>
<dd>Contents: The animated films of Patrick Smith have been a favorite at film festivals world-wide for the last decade. Smith's bizarre, morphing style and symbolic stories of identity and emotion, have influenced a new generation of traditional hand-drawn animators. Puppet: A young man fabricates a simple stock puppet, not knowing the abuse the entity will soon inflict upon it's creator. Through an excalating series of torture, the possessed puppet takes on the embodiment of fear, chaos and willful self-destruction. Handshake: In this animated film, an innocent greeting between two people is quickly transformed into a tangled struggle, illustrating the twists and turns of a full-fledged relationship. Delivery: Abuse leads to rage as two friends compete for a delivery package. Was the result of this confict worth the prize found within the box? "Delivery" deals with the realistic consequences of rage and violence, even within a cartoon setting. Drink: A boy discovers a magic potion that allows him to explore the universe within himself. A sip unleashes a violent reaction, revealing a diverse cast of characters twisting and stretching their way out of one another forming a monumental pile. Moving along: Dark imagery of conformity takes the screen as hip hop, rhythm and poetry are visualized in the Planets' track "Moving along." Extra features: Exclusive interview by AnimatorsUnite.com; directors commentary for each film ; behind the scenes Pencil Test footage. 28 min. <b>DVD 9952</b></dd>

<dt><b>Night on Bald Mountain (Une Nuit sur le Mont Chauve)</b> (France, 1933)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Alexander Alexeieff and Claire Parker. In this renowned illustration of Modest Moussorgsky's tone poem, goblins, skeletons and other fantastic creatures perform outlandish three-dimensional effects. Alexeieff later said that the images existed in his mind for some 14 years before he and Claire Parker invented the pinboard which gave the chiaroscuro textures he desired. Animator Norman McLaren listed the film "first and foremost" among the animated films he most admired and liked. "Above all, it is the quality of Alexeieff's imagination that stirs me profoundly," McLaren said. 8 min. (With <i>Alexeieff at the Pinboard</i>, &amp; <i>The Nose</i>). <b>vhs 999:3047</b></dd>

Their long dream is realized when the hated Shah is defeated in the Iranian Revolution of 1979.

With Marji dangerously refusing to remain silent at this injustice, her parents send her abroad to Vienna to study. This change proves an equally difficult trial for Marji and finds herself in a different culture loaded with abrasive characters and profound disappointments that deeply trouble her. Even when she returns home, Marji finds that both she and her homeland have changed too much and the young woman and her loving family must decide where she truly belongs. Special features: The hidden side of Persepolis ; Behind the scenes of Persepolis ; 2007 Cannes Film Festival press conference ; animated scene comparisions with commentary by Marjane Satrapi ; commentary on select scenes by Marjane Satrapi, Vincent Paronnaud and Chiara Mastroianni. <b>DVD 9864</b></dd>

<dt><b>[Tsuji, Naoyuki] The Naoyuki Tsuji Animation Collection</b></dt>
<dd>Contents: Trilogy about clouds -- A feather stares at the dark -- Experiment -- Travel to the lost world -- Wake up -- For almost forgotten stories. Japanese animator Naoyuki Tsuji creates a distinctive universe with a few simple, hand-drawn lines in charcoal and pastel. What first appears to be childlike crudeness in his animation is actually subtle, strange, and even haunting and frightening. Tsuji's films captivate because they are vague recollections of beguiling childhood dreams and memories --the wonder of the puppet show, the mystery of clouds, and the attraction of monsters. Originally released as motion pictures 1992-2005. <b>DVD X163</b></dd>

<dt><b>[Harryhausen, Ray]</b></dt>
<dd>"Before the advent of computers for camera motion control and CGI, movies used a variety of approaches to achieve animated special effects. One approach was one of the many kinds of stop-motion animation which used realistic miniature models (more accurately called model animation), used famously in King Kong (1933). The work of pioneer model animator Willis O'Brien in King Kong inspired Harryhausen to work in this unique field, almost single-handedly keeping the technique alive for three decades as O'Brien's career sadly floundered for most of his life, until his death in 1962. Harryhausen prefers not to compare his work with special effects animation in live action films to the animated films of Tim Burton, Nick Park, Ivo Caprino, Ladislav Starevich and many others, which he sees as pure "puppet films", and are more accurately (and traditionally) called "puppet animation". Model animated characters interact with, and are a part of, the live-action world, with the idea that they will cease to call attention to themselves as "animation", which is different from the more obviously "cartoony" and stylized designs in movies like Chicken Run and The Nightmare Before Christmas, etc. Springing from O'Brien's groundbreaking work, Harryhausen continued bringing stop-motion into the realm of live action movies, keeping alive and refining the techniques created by O'Brien that he had first developed as early as 1917."

<dt><b>[O'Brien, Willis]The Dinosaur and the Missing Link: A Prehistoric Tragedy</b>(1917)</dt>
<dd>Two cavemen, The Duke and Stonejaw Steve, call on Miss Araminta Rockface. The hated rivals fight, and Steve wins when he throws The Duke into a pot of boiling water. A title card introduces a third rival, "our unassuming hero, Theophilus Ivoryhead." Miss Rockface invites the three men into her father's drawing room/cave, apologizing for not offering tea, since it has not been discovered yet. The Duke and Steve fight again, and everyone rushes out of the cave. Mr. Rockface notices his pot of food is empty; earlier, Wild Willie the Missing Link had eaten it. Mr. Rockface tells the three suitors they will have to procure their own dinner. Steve locates a desert quail and shoots an arrow at it, but the arrow misses the quail and happily (for Steve) hits The Duke's behind. Meanwhile, Wild Willie is still hungry and goes hunting for snakes. He finds a dinosaur's tail instead, and when he tries to eat it the dinosaur kills him. Luckily, Theophilus witnesses this scene; after the dinosaur leaves he stands on the dead monkey-man, as if triumphant. The others arrive and are shocked that Theophilus apparently has slain the terror of the countryside. And happy Theophilus finds himself smothered in Araminta's kisses [<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0005198/plotsummary">IMDB</a>] 5 min. <b>DVD 644; vhs Video/C 999:596; vhs Video/C 999:1021; vhs Video/C 999:518</b></dd>

<dd>Sixteen short animated films produced by the East German DEFA Animation Studio. Early films were intended for a younger audience but during the 1970's and 80s animation films were created for older audiences with topics relating to the political atmosphere in the GDR.

<dd>Written and directed by Ralph Bakshi. This outrageous, original film about the status of blacks in America is told with live-action and animation vignettes, the best of which are sly parodies of the stories from Disney and Uncle Remus' Song of the South and Kim Basinger's Cool World. This allegorical tale follows the exploits of a black rabbit who comes from the rural South to New York and ends up dealing drugs in Harlem. Released in 1974, it was accused of being racist and withdrawn by its distributor within a week of its release. 90 min. <b>vhs 999:2144</b></dd>

<dd>"When first released, The Three Little Pigs contained a scene of the Wolf disguised as the "Fuller Brush Man": an outrageous Jewish peddler ethnic stereotype complete with long beard and a huge, hooked nose. Quickly, Disney relooped the ethnic-sounding voice track, and in the 1940's actually re-animated the scene without the Jewish peddler diguise." This version includes the original animation with the relooped voice. [description from <a href="http://www.facets.org">Whole Toon Catalog</a>] <b>DVD 947; vhs 999:3612</b></dd>

<dt><b>Animated Soviet Propaganda.</b><br></dt>
<dd>&#149;<b>American Imperialists.</b> Racism, unemployment, aggression, excess -- the USSR's animation studios frequently took aim at these aspects of American culture. Representing five decades of animated Soviet propaganda, this program features short films that blast the U.S. and its perceived evils. Black and White and Mister Twister extol the absence of bigotry in Soviet society while Someone Else's Voice portrays jazz as "an enemy of the people." Ave Maria condemns America's presence in Vietnam and the influence of the Catholic Church, and The Shooting Gallery underscores the violence behind economic and class divisions. 81 min. <b>DVD 5702</b></dd>

<dd>&#149; <b>Fascist Barbarians.</b> Hitler's invasion of Russia and Germany's post-WWII partition inspired a great deal of animated Soviet Propaganda.

Fascist Boots on our Homeland and Cinema Circus vilify Hitler and the Nazi invaders; A Lesson Not Learned plays on Russian fears of a reunited, vengeful, and American-supported Germany; and Vasilyok, The Adventures of the Red Ties and The Violin of the Pioneer Pen are stories about brave and loyal Soviet children encountering and standing up to fascism. 116 min. <b>DVD 5703</b></dd>

<dd>&#149;<b>Capitalist Sharks.</b> Just as America envisioned Communist threats during much of the 20th century, the specter of capitalism loomed large in the Soviet Cold War psyche.

Foreshadowing the space race, Interplanetary Revolution depicts a Communist triumph over free-market forces on Mars; China in Flames warns against capitalist interference in the Chinese Revolution; Shareholder proclaims the superiority of the Soviet economic system; and Proud Little Ship takes on capitalist aggression. 98 min. <b>DVD 5704</b></dd>

<dt><b>The Fifth-column Mouse</b> (1942)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Friz Freleng. Animated short. "In this parable for the failure of appeasement before World War II, house mice are targeted by a hungry cat, who intrudes upon their idyllic life. When all but one of the mice successfully take refuge in a wall hole, the cat promises to the one mouse who didn't manage to escape, that he won't hurt anyone, provided he's placated with pampering by every mouse in the pack. Acting as the cat's quisling, the mouse speaks to his rodent brothers, telling them to appease the cat, to give the cat all the comforts he wants, and in turn the cat will live in peace with them. The mice are wary of the cat but agree to his terms. Not surprisingly, the cat's appetite isn't assuaged, and he soon craves a mouse dinner. He chases the mice back into their hole, and the mice reject appeasement and decide to fight against the cat. They go through military prep and manufacture an ultimate weapon, a wooden dog with mechanical gears and biting teeth, to combat the cat."

The Nazi weapon for achieving this task is a goat that begins eating the metal in Daffy's junkyard. Inspired by spirits from America's patriotic past, Daffy soars into the air and becomes a "Super American" to defeat the goat and fight back against the German submarine that dispatched it. He awakens, thinking this was all a dream, and finds the German submarine at the top of his scrap pile, with a chorus of German soldiers who say, "Next time you dream, count us out!"."

The pilot lands on a "Japanese Scrap Repair Ship" where his plane is instantly rebuilt, but Popeye lands soon after, and with the help of some spinach, makes short work of that ship and heads for the Japanese aircraft carrier nearby. He fights off the crew, using them to punch a "V" in the side of the ship, then opens it like a sardine can. At the end, he tows the captured crew in a giant birdcage made out of the scrap boats. <b>DVD X2482</b></dd>
