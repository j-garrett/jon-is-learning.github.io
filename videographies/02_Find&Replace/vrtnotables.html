<dt><b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1542411/">A Film Unfinished</a></b><br>
Written and directed by Yael Hersonski.<br>
At the end of WWII, 60 minutes of raw film in an East German archive was discovered. Shot by the Nazis in Warsaw in May of 1942, the film became a resource for historians seeking an authentic record of the Warsaw Ghetto. The later discovery of a long-missing reel, including multiple takes and cameramen staging scenes, complicated earlier readings of the footage. Presented here is the raw footage in its entirety, falsely showing the 'good life' of Jewish urbanites. 90 minutes.<br>

Directed by Robert A. Clift<br>
This documentary examines the popularity of hip-hop among America's white youth and asks whether white identification is rooted in admiration and a desire to transcend race or if it is merely a new chapter in the long continuum of stereotyping, mimicry and cultural appropriation. Does it reflect a new face of racial understanding in white America or does it reinforce an ugly history? Against the unique backdrop of american popular music, the film explores racial identity in the United States. The film draws parallels between the white hip-hop fan and previous incarnations of white appropriation from blackface performer Al Jolson to mainstream artists like Elvis Presley, the Rolling Stones and Eminem. It interweaves portraits of white hip-hop artists and fans with insightful commentary by African American cultural critics. 2010 57 min.<br>

Directed by George Gage and Beth Gage.<br>
Two feisty Western Shoshone sisters put up a heroic fight for their land rights - and their human rights. Carrie and Mary Dann endure terrifying roundups by armed federal marshals in which thousands of their horses and cattle are confiscated, for the crime of grazing them on the open range outside their private ranch - even though that range is part of 60 million acres recognized as Western Shoshone land by the U.S. After the government sued them for trespassing, their dispute went to the Supreme Court, and eventually the United Nations. Why has the U.S. spent millions persecuting and prosecuting two elderly women grazing a few hundred horses and cows in a desolate desert? The Dann sisters say the real reason is the resources hidden beneath this seemingly barren land, their Mother Earth: it is the second largest gold producing area in the world. This eloquent testament to the courage of the Dann sisters is an important document for those who want to understand the ongoing resistance of Native peoples to U.S. colonialism in Indian country." [Eric Cheyfitz, Director of the American Indian Program, Cornell University]. 32 min.<br>

Directed by Heather Lyn MacDonald.<br>
Been Rich All My Life follows the most unlikely troupe of tap dancers. They are the "Silver Belles," five women aged 84 to 96. In their heyday they worked at some of Harlem's most prestigious haunts, performing with legendary band leaders like Cab Calloway, Jimmie Lunceford and Duke Ellington. They met in the 1930's as chorus dancers at the Apollo and the Cotton Club. When the big band era ended, and with it the need for show dancers, they all went into other work. They regrouped in 1985, put their shoes back on and - sassy as they ever were - are still performing regularly. They may not kick as high, but they are hip-swaying and show-biz savvy. These women will disrupt any notions you have of old age. 80 min.<br></dt>

Directed by Michael Kot.<br>
For the past two decades more than 7,000 rusting hulks of the world's largest ships have been driven onto the remote beaches off the Arabian Sea to be dismantled for scrap by hand, piece by piece. Sold for scrap, the ship owners rarely bother to abide by the U.N. Basel Convention which bans shipments of transboundary waste. A sign reading "Safety Is Our Motto" may hang over the gateway, but the workers have another, more telling slogan: "A ship a day, a death a day." One worker a day, on average, dies on the job, evaporated in explosions, crushed by falling steel, cut in half by cables or broken up from falls. Of the remainder, one in four will contract cancers caused by asbestos, PCBs and other toxic substances. Shipbreakers vividly captures both the haunting beauty of the ships and the deplorable conditions of the workers --- in an unforgettable portrayal where Third World ingenuity meets 21st century global economics.<br>
