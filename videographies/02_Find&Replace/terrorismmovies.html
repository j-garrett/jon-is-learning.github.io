<dt><b>Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (Le Charme discret de la bourgeoisie)</b> (1972)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Luis Bu&ntilde;uel. Cast: Fernando Rey, Delphine Seyrig, Stephane Audran, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Bulle Ogier, Paul Frankeur, Julien Bertheau. An all-star French cast assembles for an elegant dinner party, but whenever they try to eat, something happens to interrupt them. Mixes biting social satire with bold surrealistic invention as the dinner party serves to lampoon such targets as diplomats, wealthy socialites and even radical terrorists.<br>
"Terrorism and bomb explosions accompany Luis Bunuel?s surrealist trilogy The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972), The Phantom of Liberty (1974) and That Obscure Object of Desire (1977). The title of the last of these does not only refer to the woman the hero has fallen in love with, but also in a wider sense to the terrorism that comes to the surface in various moral, social, cultural, economic, psychological, and political forms and which manifests itself most clearly in the inexplicable bomb outrages accompanying the hero in his sexual quest. As he strides down the street in the concluding scene arm-in-arm with his ?obscure object? seemingly convinced he has finally ?got? her, bombs go off everywhere: The final word in Bunuel?s last film on violence and desire?and terror???"

<dt><b>State of Seige (&Eacute;tat de si&egrave;ge)</b> (France / West Germany / Italy, 1973)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Costa Gavras. A drama based on the true story of the interrogation and execution of CIA agent Dan Mitrione by urban guerillas, the Tupamoros of Uruguay. Kidnapped by the revolutionaries, Mitrone who had been training the country's police in sophisticated counter-insurgency and torture techniques, was held hostage in exchange for the release of political prisoners. Shot in Chile with the approval of President Allende shortly before his assassination, the film was the first to detail the uglier side of the kind of paramilitary training that the U.S. has often performed for its allies. 120 min. <b>vhs 999:3237</b></dd>

<dd>Directed by Paul Greengrass. Cast: Christian Clemenson, Trish Gates, Polly Adams, Cheyenne Jackson, Opal Alladin, Gary Commock, Nancy McDoniel, David Alan Basche, Richard Bekins, Susan Blommaert. Fact-based story about the 40 passengers and crew aboard San Francisco bound flight United 93, who sat down as strangers and found the courage to stand up as one. This hijacked flight was the fourth terrorist attack plane on September 11, 2001. As a result of a delay on takeoff, the passengers on the flight, are behind the carefully scheduled planned attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Once hijacked, the passengers and crew are able to discern that this is no mere hijacking. While the real events that caused the ultimate crash of the plane can never be known, the events depicted would appear to be as might be expected. The scariest part of the film is the unpreparedness of the FAA and the military in dealing with the situation. 111 min. <b>DVD 6134</b></dd>
