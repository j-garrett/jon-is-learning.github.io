<dt><b>Foresaken Fields</b></dt>
<dd>Before World War II, many Japanese-Americans had settled successfully as farmers in California. But when the war came, they were incarcerated under government orders and forced to sell their farms. When the war ended, many did not return to their rural homes, and those who did never recovered from the interruption in their lives. As their children moved away to college or jobs or to be with other families, there was a second forsaking of the fields. Japanese-American farming in California is a mere shadow of what it once was, yet it created the foundation for California agriculture as it is today. 2000. 27 min. <b>Video/C 8895</b><br>

<dd>&#149;1: <b>The People.</b>To the original Native American inhabitants, the West has been a land of myth. To the Europeans, such as Cabeza de Vaca and Coronado, the West was a "wilderness" to be conquered. Nearly 100 years before the American Revolution, the Pueblo people of the Southwest rose up against their European masters and drove the Spanish from their lands. Then, with America's purchase of the Louisiana Territory in 1804, Lewis and Clark set off to find the fabled Northwest Passage, as a confident young nation prepared for its own epic march across the West. 85 min. <b>DVD X1627; vhs Video/C 4519</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149;2: <b>Empire Upon the Trails.</b> In the early 1800's, no one knew who would control the seemingly infinite spaces of the West but hopeful Americans moved onward toward "Manifest Destiny", as they determined to make the West their own. Mountain men, such as Joe Meek, found more adventure than profit as they searched for furs. Missionaries such as Narcissa Whitman traveled West along with others who tried their luck on the Oregon Trail while in Mexican Texas, Sam Houston carved out his own independent republic. 85 min. <b>DVD X1627; vhs Video/C 4520</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149;3: <b>The Speck of the Future.</b> A history of the California gold rush which started in 1848, when a sawmill worker named James Marshall reached down into the streambed of the American River in California and discovered gold. Wild mining camps sprung up with each new strike while overnight San Francisco turned into an international city. 85 min. <b>DVD X1627; vhs Video/C 4521</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149;4: <b>Death Runs Riot.</b> In the 1850s, as more American pioneers poured west, they brought with them the nation's oldest, most divisive issue--slavery--and the rough frontier would supply the sparks that would ignite the Civil War. Indians would be dragged into "the white man's war," while the besieged Mormons would commit the worst massacre of innocent pioneers in American history and a young writer named Sam Clemens would find adventure in Nevada's silver camps. And as the bitter Civil War drew to a close, celebrated Union heros such as George Armstrong Custer and William Tecumseh Sherman would use the tactics which had defeated the South against the Native Americans of the West. 85 min. <b>DVD X1627; vhs Video/C 4522</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149;5: <b>The Grandest Enterprise Under God.</b>After the Civil War Americans embarked on one of the greatest technological achievements of the age-- building the first transcontinental railroad to conquer forbidding mountains, harsh deserts and awesome distances. Railroads soon transformed the West, bringing European farmers, while cowpokes such as Teddy Blue Abbott would ride dusty cattle trails to deliver herds to railheads such as Dodge and Abilene, while buffalo hunters such as Frank Mayer would drive a magnificent animal to near extinction. 85 min. <b>DVD X1627; vhs Video/C 4523</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149;6: <b>Fight No More Forever.</b> By the 1870s there were only a few pockets of resistance against the nation's push to conquer the West. On the Great Plains, Sitting Bull followed his mystical visions and urged his Lakota people to fight rather than surrender their sacred Black Hills and traditional way of life. Custer's "Last stand" would also become, in effect, the last stand of the Sioux as a free people. In Utah, the Morman patriarch Brigham Young would be forced to choose between saving his church or sacrificing his spiritual son. Farther west, Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce would find himself helping to lead one of the most extraordinary military compaigns in American history. 87 min. <b>DVD X1627; vhs Video/C 4524</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149;7: <b>The Greography of Hope.</b> By the 1870s the American conquest of the West was nearly complete. In one decade, with Native Americans effectively confined to reservations, some four-and-a-half million new settlers would arrive to stake their claim to the future. Pap Singleton, an ex-slave from Tennessee, became the era's "Black Moses," leading his people to the free soil of Kansas. A frail New York politician, Teddy Roosevelt, transformed himself into a rugged North Dakota rancher, and eventually, president of the United States. And as Americans tried to "tame" the West, the nation's greatest showman, Buffalo Bill Cody, instead offered adoring crowds his enthusiastic version of a "Wild West"--heroic, glorious, romantic, and most of all, mythic. 87 min. <b>DVD X1627; vhs Video/C 4525</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149;8: <b>Ghost Dance</b> By the late 1880s, the Americans were astounded by the changes they had brought to the West. Mining towns such as Butte, Montana were now full-fledged industrial cities. Defeated militarily, Native Americans throughout the region now flocked to the call of a Paiute mystic, who offered the illusionary hope that the lost world of the buffalo could be brought back by a Ghost Dance. But its promises would be trampled in the snow and blood of Wounded Knee. In place of the great Native American cultures which once dominated the Plains was a new culture, epitomized by the Oklahoma Land Rush, in which 100,000 eager settlers lined up for a mad dash to stake out a farm and a future.60 min. <b>DVD X1627; vhs Video/C 4526</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149;9: <b>One Sky Above Us.</b> As the 20th century neared, Americans celebrated with the World Columbian Exposition, where they were told that the frontier had closed, but in the real West, for every frontier story that ended, another one began. Some Native Americans waged a struggle to hold onto their traditions in the midst of rapid, overwhelming change, while others chose to learn the white man's ways, hoping to help their families and their tribe. In California, the emerging metropolis of Los Angeles waged yet another battle to control the arid region's most precious commodity--water. Much had changed in the West, but it continued to be what it had always been--a landscape of the imagination, the reservoir of our shared hopes and dreams, a place of both conflict and infinite possibility, and an enduring symbol of something unquestionably American. 65 min. <b>DVD X1627; vhs Video/C 4527</b><br>

<dd>Racial tensions between the Anglo and Mexican American communities in Los Angeles, California erupted into violence after the conviction of Henry "Hank" Leyvas and seventeen other Mexican American youths for the murder of Jose Diaz in what was perceived as an unfair trial in 1943. Lorena Encinas, a witness to the murder, kept the real killer's identity a secret until the end of her life. Prominent members of the Los Angeles community worked to fund an appeal for the defendents, even as battles between unruly US Naval personnel and Mexican Americans rocked L.A.'s barrios. Surviving family members of the seventeen convicts, riot witnesses and members of the Sleepy Lagoon Defense Committee tell the story of the riots, which is highlighted by photographs of the riots, the trial and their participants.Originally broadcast as an episode of the television program The American Experience. 2002. 60 min. <b>Video/C 9050</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>Berkeley in the Sixties</b>.</dt>
<dd>A film by Mark Kitechell. Contents: Pt. 1 Confronting the university: the Free Speech Movement-- pt. 2. Confronting America: the anti-war movement (32 min.) -- pt. 3. Confronting history: the counter-culture movement(45 min.). Through interviews with participants and archival footage, presents a history of Berkeley, California in the 1960s. This film is a celebration and tribute to the spirited rebellion of the students of Berkeley in the 1960s. It romanticizes the past in some ways, but the participants, many of them just as dedicated to causes as they were as youths at Berkeley offer realistic and honest remembrances from those hectic days. The film is in three distinct segments: Part I -- Confronting the University. The demonstrations began simply with students protesting the appearance of the House Un-American Activities Committee on campus to investigate communist appearances as speakers. It was the beginning of Speaker Ban. It tells of the creation of the student activist group known as SLATE, and the increasing confrontations with the University administration then led by W. Clark Kerr. 41 minutes. Part II -- Confronting America. Largely about the efforts to carry their activism beyond the campus and the narrow environment of Berkeley and Oakland. The issues of Civil Rights and Free Speech soon give way to protest against the war in a place called Vietnam. 31 minutes. Part III -- Confronting History. The emergence of the counter-culture in neighboring San Francisco, and the politicization of blacks as represented by Stokeley Carmichael and more especially the activities of Huey Newton and Bobby Seale and the Black Panthers creates a new environment for many of the people in this movement. Suddenly differences in perspective and scope of activism change. 44 minutes. Notes: Edited by Veronica Selves. Photographed by Stephen Lighthill. Narrated by Susan Griffin.

<dd>The VDL Research House was designed by architect Richard Neutra in 1932 and served as his studio and residence for the rest of his career.

The original house was destroyed by fire in 1963 and rebuilt in 1966. Neutra's post-war work reflected his interest in environmental design, seen in the VDL House II with its use of site and climate responsive features.
