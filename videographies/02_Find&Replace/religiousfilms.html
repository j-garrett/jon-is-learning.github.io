This documentary presents a complete look at the history of this motion picture genre through the use of extensive film trailers and the words of directors, producers and stars who comment on how the films were made, why they were so popular, and how they launched the careers of some of Hollywood's biggest stars. c1994. 90 min. <b>Video/C 9318</b><br>

<dd>Directed by John Patrick Shanley. Cast: Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, Viola Davis, Alice Drummond, Audrie Neenan, Susan Blommaert, Carrie Preston, John Costelloe, Lloyd Clay Brown, Joseph Foster II. 1964, St. Nicholas in the Bronx. Father Flynn is a charismatic priest who is trying to upend the schools' strict customs, which have long been fiercely guarded by Sister Aloysius Beauvier. The Sister is the iron-gloved principal who believes in the power of fear and discipline. With the winds of political change, the school has just accepted its first black student, Donald Miller. But when Sister James shares with Sister Aloysius her suspicion that Father Flynn is paying too much personal attention to Donald, Sister Aloysius sets off on a personal crusade to unearth the truth and to expunge Flynn from the school. Now, without any proof, besides her moral certainty, Sister Aloysius locks into a battle of wills with Father Flynn which threatens to tear apart the community with its irrevocable consequence. 103 min. <b>DVD X1870</b></dd>

<dd>Directed by Claudia Llosa. Cast: Magaly Solier, Carlos de la Torre, Yiliana Chong, Ubaldo Huaman. Madeinusa is a 14 year old girl with a sweet Indian face who lives in an isolated village in the Cordillera Blanca Mountain range of Peru. This strange place is characterized by its religious fervor. From Good Friday at three o'clock in the afternoon (the time of day when Christ died on the cross) to Easter Sunday, the whole village can do whatever it feels like. During the two holy days sin does not exist: God is dead and can't see what is happening. Everything is accepted and allowed, without remorse. Year after year, Madeinusa and her sister Chale, and her father Don Cayo, the Mayor and local big shot, maintain this tradition without questioning it. However, everything changes with the arrival in the village of Salvador, a young geologist from Lima, who will unknowingly change the destiny of the girl. 95 min. <b>DVD 6974</b></dd>

<dt><b>Simon of the Desert (Sim&#243;n del Desierto)</b> (Mexico, 1965)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Luis Bu&#241;uel. Bu&#241;uel's bizarre, very off-beat film based loosely on the life of the 5th century saint, Simeon Stylites. Simon has stood on top of a pillar in the desert for six years, six weeks and six days. His saintliness and denial prompts the Devil to try and tempt him in a variety of guises (all of them female). A bizarre conclusion, with a hint of nuclear catastrophe waiting in the wings, rounds things off quite nicely in this off-beat film. Special DVD features: A Mexican Bu&#241;uel (1997), a 50 min. documentary by Emilio Maill&#233; ; new interview with actress Silvia Pinal ; new and improved subtitle translation; new essay by Michael Wood and a reprint interview with Bu&#241;uel. 45 min. <b>DVD X1133; vhs 999:165</b></dd>
