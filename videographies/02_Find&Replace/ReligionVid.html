</dl>
<dl>
<dd>&#149;<b>Episode 1. The First Christianity.</b> In the first of a six part series sweeping across four continents, Professor MacCulloch goes in search of Christianity's forgotten origins. He overturns the familiar story that it all began when the apostle Paul took Christianity from Jerusalem to Rome. Instead, he shows that the true origins of Christianity lie east, and at one point appeared to be poised to triumph in Asia. <b>DVD X3548</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>&#149; <b>Episode 2. Catholicism : The Unpredicatable Rise of Rome.</b> The second segment of this 6-part series explores the rise of the Roman Catholic Church. Over one billion Christians look to Rome - that's more than half of all Christians on the planet. But how did a small Jewish sect from the backwoods of 1st century Palestine, which preached humility and the virtue of poverty, become the established religion of Western Europe - wealthy, powerful and expecting unfailing obedience from the faithful? <b>DVD X3549</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>&#149;Episode 3. Orthodoxy: From Empire to Empire. Today, Eastern Orthodox Christianity flourishes in the Balkans and Russia with over 150 million members worldwide. It's quite unlike Catholicism or Protestantism: worship is carefully choreographed, icons pull the faithful into a mystical union with Christ, and everywhere is a symbol of a fierce-looking bird - the double-headed eagle. In his third journey into the History of Christianity Diarmaid MacCulloch charts Orthodoxy's extraordinary fight for survival. <b>DVD X3550</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>&#149;<b>Episode 4. Reformation: The Individual Before God.</b> In the fourth part of his History of Christianity Diarmaid MacCulloch makes sense of the Reformation, and of how a faith based on obedience and authority gave birth to one based on individual conscience. He shows how Luther wrote hymns to teach people the message of the Bible, and how Ulrich Zwingli - a Swiss Reformer - encouraged followers to tear down statues of saints, allow married clergy and denied that communion bread and wine were the body and blood of Christ. <b>DVD X3551</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>&#149;<b>Episode 5. Protestantism: The Evangelical Explosion.</b> Traces the growth of an exuberant expression of faith that has spread across the globe - Evangelical Protestantism. The Evangelical explosion has been driven by a concern for social justice and the claim that you could stand in a direct emotional relationship with God. It allowed the Protestant faith to burst its boundaries from its homeland in Europe. In America, it has become associated with conservative politics and its preachers have marketed Christianity with all the flair and swashbuckling enterprise of American commerce. In Africa it converted much of the continent by adapting to local traditions, and now it's expanding into Asia. <b>DVD X3552</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>&#149;<b>Episode 6. God in the Dock.</b> In the last program in the series MacCulloch challenges the simplistic notion that faith in Christianity has steadily ebbed away before the relentless advance of science, reason and progress and shows instead how the tide of faith perversely flows back in. Despite the attacks of Newton, Voltaire, the French Revolutionaries and Darwin, Christianity has shown a remarkable resilience. The greatest damage to Christianity in fact was inflicted to its moral credibility by the two great wars of the 20th century and by its entanglement with Fascism and Nazism. And yet it is in crisis that the Church has rediscovered deep and enduring truths about itself. <b>DVD X3553</b></dd>

<dd>&#149; <b>The Birth of a New Religion: Christianity in the 1st and 2nd Centuries.</b> Presents the life of Jesus against the backdrop of 1st century Judea, inhabited by the Jews and occupied by the forces of the Roman Empire. After the Resurrection, Saul of Tarsus, later Paul, became a champion of a budding new religion based on Jesus' teachings: Christianity. Part 2 traces the spread of the faith and its inevitable clash with Rome. Despite persecution, Christianity thrived, setting down roots and creating the New Testament. <b>Video/C 8656</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>&#149;<b>Trials and Triumphs in Rome: Christianity in the 3rd and 4th Centuries.</b> Part 1 of this program places Christianity -- an outlawed faith-within the context of the religiously diverse Roman Empire, whose citizens worshipped the old Greco-Roman gods, mystery cult figures such as Mithra, and the Emperor himself. But by appealing to all people and promising eternal salvation, Christianity began to surpass the popularity of the Roman religions. Part 2 begins with Diocletian's Great Persecution; proceeds to Constantine's conversion, the Edict of Milan, and the Council of Nicaea; and closes with the excommunication of Theodosius. <b>Video/C 8657</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>&#149;<b>African Ascetics and Celtic Monks: Christianity in the 5th and 6th Centuries.</b> Part 1 of this program introduces Augustine of Hippo and his The City of God, which examines the Church's uneasy relationship with human frailty and wordliness, as piety became indentified with self-denial and celibacy was viewed as central to the pursuit of perfection. Part 2 tracks the spread of Christianity to Ireland and its establishment in Britain and Northern Europe by celtic monks, who had formulated the concept of penance and the culture of pilgrimage. <b>Video/C 8658</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>&#149; <b>Byzantium and the Holy Roman Empire: Christianity in the 7th and 8th Centuries.</b> Part 1 of this program contrasts the ill health of Rome and its Church with the spiritual and material vitality of Byzantium. But all was not well even in the East, as war with Persia and the rise and swift spread of Islam made the Holy Land off limits, while arguments about the nature of Christ continued to split the Christian world. Part 2 focuses on the conversion of the Saxon tribes first by Bishop Boniface, the Apostle of Germany, and then by King Charlemagne, who was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III. <b>Video/C 8659</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>&#149;<b>The Dark Ages and the Millennium: Christianity in the 9th and 10th Centuries.</b> Part 1 probes the nature of Christian prayer, questioning Eastern reliance on icons rather than the Word, as in the West. Part 2 chronicles the chaos in Europe that broke out with the death of Charlemagne and the approach of the millennium. The ensuing political instability, combined with fears of the Apocalypse, stood in stark contrast to the efforts of the Peace of God movement and the Abbey of Cluny to maintain order. <b>Video/C 8660</b></dd>

<dl>
<dd>&#149; <b>Crusaders and Schism in the East: Christianity in the 11th and 12th Centuries.</b> Part 1 of this program documents both the papal reforms that severed the ties between the Church and the wealthy Roman families and the rift between Rome and Constantinople. Efforts to reconcile differences in doctrine, clerical practice, and political influence ended in the excommunication of Constantinople's Patriarch. Part 2 outlines the first four Crusades, in which Jerusalem was won and lost and Byzantium fell to the swords of its own Christian allies. The transfiguring influence of Islamic scholarship on Europe is also spotlighted. <b>Video/C 8661</b></dd>

<dd>&#149; <b>Heresy, war, and the Black Death: Christianity in the 13th and 14th Centuries.</b> Part 1 of this program follows the dual enterprises of constructing cathedrals and stamping out heresy. Buildings of unprecedented grandeur exemplified the power and influence of the Church in Europe, as did the systematic destruction of the heretic Cathars. Part 2 covers King Philip IV of France's defiance of Church authority; the Hundred Years' War, and the Black Death. Although the Pope declared the Plague a judgment by God, rumors of a Jewish plot were rife, leading to anti-Semitic massacres in Germany and elsewhere. <b>Video/C 8662</b></dd>

<dl>
<dd>&#149;<b>Sectarianism and Schism in Europe: Christianity in the 15th and 16 Centuries.</b> Part 1 of this program highlights the Great Schism. The Papacy's move to achieve political independence and the flowering of the Renaissance are presented as well, along with the violent opposition to the new papal politics and the humanism that was remaking God in man's image. Part 2 plots out the religious revolt sparked by the sale of indulgences, from Martin Luther's 95 Theses, to the Inquisition, to the Protestantism of John Calvin. The spread of the Catholic faith to Latin America by the Jesuits is also discussed. <b>Video/C 8663</b></dd>

<dd>&#149;<b>Fighting Intolerance and slavery: Christianity in the 17th and 18th Centuries.</b> Part 1 traces the spread of Christianity via the Puritans to North America. Victims of intolerance in the Old World, the emigres swiftly proved intolerant of others in the New World, leaving to the Quakers to promote the religious freedom later associated with the United States. Part 2 outlines the Scientific and Industrial Revolutions, the Methodism of John Wesley, and the concept of human rights. How had the un-Christian institution of slavery endured so long in Europe and most notably, in egalitarian America? <b>Video/C 8664</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>&#149;<b>Coping with Scientific and Social Change: Christianity in the 19th and 20th Centuries.</b> Part 1 of this program asks whether religion and science can coexist in a post-Darwinian world. Are creation and evolution mutually exclusive? Part 2 focuses on the questions raised by the global movement toward social equality. Must Christianity adapt to survive, and if so, do issues like female priests and homosexuality threaten to rob it of its scriptural authority? Should the Church restructure along democratic lines? And what role will New Age religions and the Pentecostal movement play as Christianity enters its third millennium? <b>Video/C 8665</b></dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>&#149;<b>With God on Our Side, Part 1: The Early Crusades, 1950-1968.</b> Postwar fundamentalism is marked by optimism, mass revival meetings and disdain for worldly politics. But current events prod evangelical Christians into the political arena. Dismayed by Supreme Court rulings banning school prayer and encouraged by the Goldwater '64 campaign, conservative Christians rise up to launch a nationwide revolt against sex education. Narrator: Cliff Robertson. Commentary: Jon Braun, Mel White, Jerry Falwell, Mark Hatfield,, Billy James Hargis, Phyllis Schlafly, James Dunn, Peter Gillquist, E.V. Hill, Haywood Robinson, Carl F. Henry, Pierre Guillermin, Charles Colson, Tim LaHaye, Morton Blackwell, Harold I. Lief. 56 min. <b>Video/C 6030</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>&#149;<b>With God on Our Side, Part 2: The Zeal of Thy House, 1969-1974.</b> While campus evangelists go head-to-head with campus radicals Billy Graham and Richard Nixon join forces to champion "The Silent Majority." Watergate soon teaches Graham the perils of political entanglement. But the die has been cast, and in Kanawha County, West Virginia--where a local textbook controversy escalates into jailings, bombings and a miners' strike--the Religious Right is born. Narrator: Cliff Robertson. Commentary: Mark Hatfield, Charles Colson, James Dunn, Jon Braun, Peter Gillquist, Kathryn Long, Bill Bright, Jerry Falwell, Kenneth Briggs, Pat Robertson, Paul Weyrich, James Moffett. 56 min. <b>Video/C 6031</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>&#149;<b>With God on Our Side, Part 3: We Are Family, 1974-1980.</b> When Presidential candidate Jimmy Carter declares himself "born again", the media is befuddled--but his religious faith helps convince voters he can heal the nation. 1976 heralds a new era for evangelicals in every arena, yet modern life also means divorce, feminism, and gay rights. At the White House Conference on Families, conservative Christians choose polarization on those issues over reuniting the American family. Narrator: Cliff Robertson. Commentary: James Dunn, Bob Maddox, Kenneth Briggs, Cal Thomas, Jody Powell, Stuart Eizenstat, Pat Robertson, Connie Marshner, Os Guinness, Mel White, Phyllis Schlafly, John Carr, Paul Weyrich, Tim LaHaye, Francis Schaeffer. 56 min. <b>Video/C 6032</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>&#149;<b>With God on Our Side, Part 4: Prophets and Advisors, 1979-1984.</b> Seizing the pro-family agenda, New Right conservative strategists midwife a brood of new Christian political organizations, most notably Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority. These groups experience a heady overnight success, registering millions of evangelical voters and helping sweep Ronald Reagan into office. Yet once in the White House, his mainline Republican advisors actively suppress the traditional values issues. Evangelical leaders are forced to choose between 'speaking the truth' and 'going along to get along' in the political realm. Narrator: Cliff Robertson. Commentary: Jerry Falwell, Morton Blackwell, Paul Weyrich, Connie Marshner, Francis Schaeffer, Os Guinness, Udo Middelmann, Edith Schaeffer, C. Everett Koop, Ed Dobson, James Robison, Michael Deaver, John Conlan, Pat Robertson, Cal Thomas, Ed McAteer, Mel White. 56 min. <b>Video/C 6033</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>&#149;<b>With God on Our Side, Part 5: And Who Shall Lead Them? 1985-1988.</b> Anti-abortion activists cheered when Reagan named one of their own, C. Everett Koop, as Surgeon General. By the mid-80s, though, AIDS hits home even in fundamentalists circles and Koop splits with his former allies over the proper Christian response to this 'sign of God's judgement.' Pat Robertson mobilizes an 'invisible army' to support his bid for the presidency. Though dogged by televangelist scandals, the Robertson campaign sets the agenda for George Bush's victory over Michael Dukakis. Narrator: Cliff Robertson. Commentary: Everett Koop, Richard Viguerie, Paul Weyrich, Mel White, Pat Robertson, Francis Schaeffer, Jimmy Allen, Jerry Falwell, E.V. Hill, Ed Dobson, Phyllis Schlafly, Doug Wead, E.J. Dionne. 56 min. <b>Video/C 6034</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>&#149;<b>With God on Our Side, Part 6: God's Armies, 1989-1994.</b> While George Bush strains to win their trust, religious leaders turn to a new crusade: building a true grassroots power structure from the ashes of the Robertson campaign. The fruit of their efforts, the Christian Coalition, is now one of most politically adept membership organizations ever. Yet many inside the movement question if, in gaining power in the secular world, conservative Christians have lost their evangelical soul. This final program lays bare the struggle for the future of the religious right and of America. Narrator: Cliff Robertson. Commentary: Pat Robertson, Ralph Reed, Doug Wead, Randall Terry, Phyllis Schlafly, E.J. Dionne, Michael Horton, Kevin Phillips, Os Guinness, Martin Mawyer, David Noebel, Bill McCartney, Luis Palau, Haywood Robinson, James Dobson, Wellington Boon, Charles Colson. 56 min. <b>Video/C 6035</b></dd>

<dt><b>This Far by Faith, African-American Spiritual Journeys.</b><br></dt>
<dd>&#149;<b>Episode one:</b> There is a river explores the evolution of African-American religious thought, from the beliefs and rituals Africans brought to America to the influence of Christian teachings imposed on slaves in the new world. It charts the growth of independent black churches and attempts by slaves and free blacks to unify the black community. Through the lives of two nineteenth-century black leaders, Sojourner Truth and Denmark Vesey, we see how religion and belief in God provided hope in the face of desperation. c2003. 120 min. <b>DVD 3055</b></dd>
<dd>&#149;<b>Episode two:</b> God is a Negro focuses on the role of Henry McNeal Turner, whose efforts to create a sense of self-respect among African-Americans began in the political arena and shifted to the religious realm. His emphasis on a black nationalist philosophy and his rejection of white power alienated him from some leaders, but led to a greater role for the black church in African-American culture. Turner's philosophy and teachings encouraged his followers to find God from within, raising their opinions about themselves and all black people. c2003. 120 min. <b>DVD 3055</b></dd>

Dorsey, two men a generation apart but united by a vision to take the stark reality of the streets into the church, challenging Christianity to be true to its promise of acceptance. In Chicago, Thomas Dorsey pioneers a different direction for spiritual expression: gospel music. In San Francisco, the Reverend Cecil Williams strives to pull down barriers with his "come as you are" church. Through their efforts, Dorsey, Williams and others create a new faith and a new music. c2003. 120 min. <b>DVD 3055</b></dd>

<dd>&#149;<b>Episode four:</b> Freedom faith traces the connections between "Freedom faith"--The belief that God intended all people to be equal and free--and the Civil Rights Movement. Faith gave black families a way of insulating themselves from the oppression of segregation in the 1940s and 1950s, and provided the seeds for opposition to Jim Crow. Many of the protests of the 1960s are shown from the perspective of Prathia Hall, an eminent black preacher who was born in 1940 and literally grew up with the movement.
