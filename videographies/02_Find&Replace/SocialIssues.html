<dt><b>Writ Writer</b></dt>
<dd>In 1960, Fred Arispe Cruz, a young man from San Antonio, Texas was arrested for robbery, convicted and sent to a state prison farm to pick cotton. Inspired by the civil rights movement, Cruz, a Mexican American with only an 8th grade education, became jailhouse lawyer--writ writer in prison parlance--and the catalyst of prison reform in Texas. Because he helped other prisoners with lawsuits, the Texas Department of Corrections classified Cruz as an agitator, transferred him to the Ellis Unit "the Alcatraz of Texas," and subjected him to long periods in solitary confinement. Cruz filed a case against George Beto, director of the TDC, which Cruz won in the Supreme Court. This led directly to the 1974 class action suit that found the TDC system unconstitutional. As told by wardens, convicts, and former prisoners who knew him, the film weaves contemporary and archival film footage to evoke the fascinating transformation of Fred Cruz from prisoner to activist, and a prison system still haunted by its past.

In the 1970s, as part of Richard Nixon's war on drugs, the U.S. joined in an all-out attack on the convoys in union with the Thai police. Lo Hsing-Han, the first "King of Opium" was arrested but the opium trade continued under the second "King of Opium", Khun Sa. <b>Video/C 5296</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149;<b>Part II: Smack City.</b> In Hong Kong opium was sold under a government license until the end of WWII when Britain enforced the UN treaty against narcotics. In the 1960s Hong Kong's suppliers and addicts switched from the relatively innocuous opium to the more addictive heroin because it was easier to smuggle and consume. This film follows the fortunes of one gang which controlled the selling of heroin on one street corner and also follows the Hong Kong police as they raid heroin factories and distribution centers in what appears to be a futile struggle. <b>Video/C 5297</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149;<b>Part III: The Kings of Opium.</b> This third segment returns to the Shans' war for independence led by Khun Sa, the second "King of Opium". In 1993 the Shan People's Republic Committee declared itself no longer part of the union of Burma. Lo Hsing-Han meanwhile joined the government forces and eventually brought Khun Sa to his knees, regaining control once again over the narcotics trade, but this time for the military dictatorship. Today both men are rich and powerful, and the amount of opium produced in Shan State has increased ten-fold, flooding Europe and the United States with cheap heroin. <b>Video/C 5298</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>Hollywood Censored: Movies, Morality &amp; the Production Code</b> <i>(Culture Shock; 1)</i></dt>
<dd>First of a four part series exploring why particular works of art became controversial. Part one addresses the mass appeal of movies, including their portrayals of sex and violence which have made them a target of censors since the early days. In the 1930s, Hollywood studios enforced the Production Code, a set of guidelines for movie content, to answer growing charges of immorality. The Code lasted 20 years and still influences moviemaking today. As feature films continue to cause controversy, the question remains: do movies reflect--or cause--social behavior? c2000. 60 min. <b>Video/C 6908</b><br></dd>

A CIA film called "Burial at Sea"--Recorded in 1974 but unacknowledged until 1992 - documents the burial at sea of six Soviet sailors, in a ceremony which collapses Cold War antagonisms in a moment of death and honor. Images pertaining to a publicly acknowledged but top secret U.S. missile strike in Yemen in 2002 are the source of a concluding reflection on the role of documents in the constitution of the dynamic of knowing and not knowing. c2003. 25 min. <b>Video/C MM529</b><br></dd>

What leverage can society use to put curbs on the more outrageous forms of media expression while retaining a respect for creativity and freedom of expression?

<dt><b>America's War on Poverty.</b> 57 min. each.<br></dt>
<dd>&#149;<b>In This Affluent Society.</b> In the early 1960s, hundreds of Kentucky coal miners are displaced by machines and strike out at their former employers. Millions of others displaced by machines across Appalachia and the rural South head north to begin a new life in Chicago, where they face overcrowded tenements and schools, and the familiar inequities of segregation. This program recounts these stories of desperation and hope and explores the origins of the federal government's war on poverty and how attitudes toward race and faith in the accessibility of the American dream shape the battle plans for the nation's greatest effort to reduce poverty. <b>DVD 9790 [preservation copy]; vhs Video/C 3926</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149;<b>Given a Chance.</b> Early 1965 is a critical period for President Johnson's war on poverty.

Head Start is created to provide poor children with adequate nutrition, health care and the educational advantages that other American children enjoy. This program focuses on the Head Start program in Mississippi. <b>DVD 9791 [preservation copy]; Video/C 3927</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149;<b>City of Promise.</b> The context for the war on poverty shifts after 1965. Urban rebellions provoke a sense of urgency for some, while others now see the war against poverty as hopeless. Increasingly, the media and the public equate poverty with inner-city black communities. This program looks at the anger and despair of the poor and the powerless, and the anger and frustration of the middle class at having to pay for "others' mistakes." It also examines attempts made in Newark, New Jersey, to reclaim the inner city through public/private partnerships. <b>DVD 9792 [preservation copy]; Video/C 3928</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>In Service to America.</b> By 1967, poverty warriors increase the sophistication of their tactics at the same time that a number of outspoken opponents rise to national prominence.

Lawyers team up with migrant farm workers in California to fight for better education, health care and working conditions, and VISTA volunteers and local residents organize against strip mining in Appalachia. Both stories raise significant questions about activities the government funds in the name of fighting poverty. <b>DVD 9793 [preservation copy]; Video/C 3929</b><br></dd>

Will they "naturally" reverse themselves or will America get to the point where disparities are so wide that we finally find the political will to take action? Conversely, will the disparities themselves grow so wide as to discourage action, by fostering resignation among the losers and indifference among the winners?

<dt><b>The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till</b></dt>
<dd>This film that helped reopen one of history's most notorious cold case civil rights murders, is the result of the director's 10-year journey to uncover the truth. In August, 1955, Mamie Till-Mobley of Chicago sent her only child, Emmett Louis Till, to visit relatives in the Mississippi Delta. Little did she know that only 8 days later, Emmett would be abducted from his Great-Uncle's home, brutally beaten and murdered for one of the oldest Southern taboos : whistling at a white woman in public. It was Beauchamp's nine years of investigation, summarized in the film, that was primarily responsible for the reopening of the case by the Justice Department. Produced and directed by Keith A. Beauchamp Special features: director's commentary with Keith A. Beauchamp ; the Harvard Civil Rights Project ; featurette "The Impact of the Emmett Till Case in American History and Today" ; trailer gallery. 2005. 70 min. <b>DVD 5182</b><br></dd>

<dt><b><a name="vincentwho" id="vincentwho">Vincent Who?</a></b></dt>
<dd>Looks at the legacy of the case of Vincent Chin, a young Chinese American man who was attacked and killed at his bachelor's party at a suburban Detroit bar by current and former autoworkers who were unhappy with competition from Japanese auto manufacturers. The case attracted wide attention after Chin's attackers struck a plea bargain and were sentenced to three thousand dollars in fines and three years in prison, time that they never were required to serve after posting bail. Indignation by the Asian American community and others led to further charges being filed against the perpetrators. The film explores how the murder of Vincent Chin continues to have meaning to society today, as well as how the hate crime remains unknown or forgotten in many Americans' minds. Written &amp; produced by Curtis Chin ; directed by Tony Lam. 2009. 40 min. <b>DVD X3182</b><br></dd>
