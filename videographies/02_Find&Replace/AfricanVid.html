<dt><b>Africa and the United States.</b></dt>
<dd>Africa, a continent of 55 nations is literally defined by dichotomy, a land of famine, human rights abuses and failed nation states but also of untapped wealth and the setting of one of history's greatest nonviolent revolutions, the transition to Black majority rule in South Africa. These dichotomies are reflected in American foreign policy which seems caught between constructive engagement and benign neglect. Carol Lancaster, Dept. Asst. Sec. of State for African Affairs and Susan Rice, Asst. Sec. of State for African Affairs discuss American foreign policy in relation to Africa.

<dt><b><a name="chief" id="chief">Chief! La Tete Dans les Nuages(Head in the Clouds)</a></b></dt>
<dd>Chef!: The filmmaker locates the roots of Africa's authoritarian regimes in the patriarchal family, reinforced by traditional kingship and the colonial experience. He made a visit to his ancestral village, Bandjoun, in the Ghomala speaking region of Western Cameroon, where he planned to film dances dedicating a monument to King Kamga Joseph II, the filmmakers' great grand uncle, but the ceremony soon turned into a celebration of one-man rule, in particular Cameroonian President Paul Biya's.<br>
La tete dans les nuages: Teno investigates the ties between unaccountable government and an unproductive economy. The government controlled formal sector, like its colonial predecessor, is essentially parasitical. An informal sector has emerged parallel to it which increasingly supplies the daily subsistence needs of the people. Irene, for example, works at the Ministry of Education for an unreliable and inadequate salary; she earns the money she needs to eat from selling beignets in the market. She also belongs to a tontine or "credit union" which offers its members a pool of capital to draw on for business ventures. Such clubs, ubiquitous among African market women, help fill the economic and social vacuum left by the decay of traditional society and the unresponsiveness of the formal banking sector. 1999. 96 min.

<dt><b>The Silent Crisis</b>(Life; 5)</dt>
<dd>Explores the economic and social crises facing the Central African Republic by examining the country's ill-equipped health system. A landlocked former French colony of just under four million people, the Central African Republic is one of the least developed countries in the world but appeals for aid have fallen largely on deaf ears. Only a handful of aid agencies continue to work there, and the amount of aid it gets is pitiful compared to other sub-Saharan countries. In 2003, it received just $12.9 USD per person. President Francois Bozize confirms that health is the country's top priority. Bozize has pledged to restore the country's national unity and security, but foreign governments have been slow to respond to his repeated requests for assistance and support.

<dd>After oil, coffee is the most actively traded commodity in the world with $80 billion in retail sales. But for every $3 cup of coffee, a coffee farmer receives only 3 cents. Most of the money goes to the middlemen, especially the four giant conglomerates which control the coffee market. Tracing the path of the coffee consumed each day to the farmers who produce the beans, Black Gold asks us to 'wake up and smell the coffee', to face the unjust conditions under which our favorite drink is produced and to decide what we can do about it. In particular, It follows Tadesse Meskela as he tries to get a living wage for the 70,000 Ethiopian coffee farmers he represents.

<dt><b>The Great Health Service Swindle.</b>(Life; 5)</dt>
<dd>Explores why Ghanaian nurses have been leaving their country to work abroad, and what this "brain drain" means for the Ghanaian health care system. One widely quoted source says almost two thousand nurses left the country between 1995 and 2002. The exodus is set to continue as nurses opt to leave a crumbling health system to earn more abroad. In the UK, some nurses can earn more in a day than they could in a month back home. Spending on health in Ghana has gone up but its value has declined because of inflation. While most of that money goes to wages, patients have to pay because the health service operates on a "user pays" principle, the so-called "cash and carry" system. The stresses of this system is one reason health workers leave. Filmed &amp; directed by Kim Hopkins. 2005. 26 min. DVD 8389<br></dd>
