<dt><b>The Jazz Singer</b>(1927)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Alan Crosland. Cast: Al Jolson, Mary McAvoy, Warner Oland, William Demarest, Eugenie Besserer, Otto Lederer, Josef Rosenblatt. Jakie Rabinowitz is the son of a Jewish cantor. Turning his back on family tradition, Jakie transforms himself into cabaret-entertainer Jack Robin. When Jack comes home to visit his parents, he is warmly greeted by his mother, but is given the cold-shoulder by his father, who feels that Jack is a traitor to his heritage by singing jazz music. On the eve of his biggest show business triumph, Jack receives word that his father is dying. Out of respect, Jack foregoes his opening night to attend Atonement services at the temple and sings the Kol Nidre in his father's place. In motion picture history, this marks the first feature film to utilize synchronous sound. Actor Al Jolson's songs include "Toot, toot, tootsie", "Blue skies", and "Mammy". Special features: Disc 1: Commentary by Ron Hutchinson, founder of The Vitaphone Projects and Nighthawks Bandleader Vince Giordano; vintage Al Jolson short films: "A plantation act," "An intimate dinner in celebration of Warner Bros. Silver Jubilee," "Hollywood handicap," and "A day at Santa Anita" ; radio show adaptation and movie trailer gallery; classic homage cartoon "I love to singa" which features a jazz-singing Owl Jolson. 89 min. <b>DVD 8594; vhs 999:790</b><br>
"Since its premiere in 1927, many jazz critcs have overlooked The Jazz Singer, America's pioneer talking picture, in the history of American jazz film. Despite its title, the talkie's account of Old World vs. New World tension and Jewish assimilation has little to do with the jazz sound made famous by such artists as Louis Armstrong and Jelly Roll Morton. Yet as crtic Krin Gabbard argues, the film's appropriation of the title jazz reflects the cultural understanding of "jazz" during the American Jazz Age. In the 1920s, jazz, referring in general to up-tempo music, represented the emotional release and freedom of a generation striving to break established social conventions. While African American contributions to jazz were largely overlooked in the rise of Paul Whiteman and Al jolson's fame, blackface minstrelsy of the age represented white Americans attempt to ventriloquize blacks associated with supposed freedom of Negro primitivisim. Using jazz to represent Raboniwitz's break from Old World tradition and featuring a finale in blackface minstrelsy, The Jazz Singer (as Gabbard argues) lays the foundation for cultural representations of jazz in American cinema."

<dt><b>Miss Lulu Bett</b> (1921)</dt>
<dd>Directed by William C. de Mille. Cast Lois Wilson, Theodore Roberts, Helen Ferguson, Mabel Van Buren. "Lulu Bett and her mother live with her sister, Ina, and brother-in-law, Dwight, and their two daughters - Diana, an older teenager, and a younger daughter, Monona, the typical pesky adolescent. Lulu is the housekeeper, cook and all-around "drudge" for the household and, although a relative, is treated with no more compassion than hired help and possibly with more disdain. Her domineering brother-in-law apparently takes great pleasure in cruel teasing, even his own children. His teasing toward Lulu is a constant reminder that she is not attractive and has no suitors. One day Dwight's world-traveling brother, Ninian, comes along after 20 years absence and falls for Lulu. Basically as an "I'll show you" reaction to her brother-in-law's teasing, she agrees to Ninian's marriage proposal. Later, however, he reveals that his wife left him 15 years ago, and he is not sure if she is alive or not. Lulu decides to go back home rather than risk living with a bigamist. This only intensifies the difficult situation at home as she has now embarrassed the family, a fact Dwight wants to keep quiet. The handsome schoolteacher, Neil Cornish, begins to show an interest in her, but Dwight does not approve - after all, Lulu may still be married. Lulu tells Neil about her marriage and the dilemma of not knowing if she's legally married or not. This does not dissuade him, and he continues to see Lulu. Diana is just as dissatisfied with the home as Lulu and decides to elope with Bobby Larkin. When Lulu learns of this, she goes to the train station and convinces Diana to come home. She promises not to tell Diwght and Ina. At home Diana has gone to her room, when Dwight and Ina come in and see Lulu wearing her hat and holding Diana's suitcase. They immediately assume she is running away with Neil and begin to berate her for trying to further disgrace the family. Dwight orders her to leave. Lulu's life seems to be crashing down all around her - she doesn't know if she's legally married or not, she can't return Neil's love for her, and she has no home or means of income."

<dt><b>Picadilly</b> (UK, 1929)</dt>
<dd>Direced by E.A. Dupont. Cast: Anna Mae Wong, Jameson Thomas, Gilda Gray, Charles Laughton, Cyril Ritchard, Hannah Jones. "Just before making his talkie directorial debut with Atlantic, director E.A. DuPont dashed off the silent "backstage" drama Piccadilly. By the time the film was released in 1929, talking pictures had taken a firm hold of the British film industry, obliging DuPont to reshoot much of the picture with dialogue. American screen favorites Anna May Wong and Gilda Gray (the girl who popularized the "shimmy dance") head the cast, the former as Shosho, a dishwasher in the London nightclub where the latter, cast as dancer Mabel Greenfield, performs nightly. Jealous of Mabel's dancing partner Victor Smiles (Cyril Ritchard), club owner Wilmot (Jameson Thomas) fires Victor, whereupon business drops off dramatically. In desperation, Wilmot takes Shosho out of the kitchen and puts her on stage, where she scores a big success. Feeling threatened by Shosho, Mabel heads to her rival's apartment with blood in her eye. A shot rings out, Shosho falls dead, and Mabel is accused of murder. But during the trial, it turns out that Shosho was done in by her Chinese sweetheart Jim (Kim Ho Chang). In his first feature film appearance, Charles Laughton performs an outrageous bit as a rowdy night club patron; also seen in a minuscule role is young Ray Milland. The talkie version of Piccadilly wasn't released in the U.S. until 1932."

Helene Hallier, an ambitious by innocent would-be young chorine, trumps a music hall publicity stunt to become the new Parisian nightclub sensation. The light story is only a pretext for La Revue des Revues' white-hot, non-stop procession of outrageously and scantily attired exotic dancers, showgirls, and acrobats including the Tiller's Follies Girls, Ruth Zackey and the Hoffman Girls, and danseuse russe Lila Nikolska. But it's Josephine Baker, "the high priestess of primitivism" who triumphs in two show stopping numbers. 103 min. <b>DVD 9107</b></dd>

Arguably Swanson's finest performance of the silent era. A classic tale of Sadie, a loose woman who sails to Pago Pago to start a new life, only to fall under the influence of an unforgiving and overzealous preacher whose lust for her masquerades as a desire to save her soul. Unable to accept his sin, he cuts his throat and Sadie goes to Sydney with an admiring marine. Sadly, the final reel is currently lost. 97 min. <b>DVD X353</b></dd>

The film was a massive hit, and the eccentric inventor became a mogul in Hollywood, making Jean Harlow a star and enjoying a romance with Katharine Hepburn.

Hughes also found time to romance Ava Gardner and founded his own airline, Trans-World Airlines. As his ideas became bolder and more eccentric, he gained many powerful enemies. 170 min. <b>DVD 3996</b><br>

<dd>Directed by Ron Howard. Cast: Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger, Paul Giamatti, Craig Bierko, Paddy Considine, Bruce McGill, David Huband. During the Great Depression, an everyday common-man hero, James J. Braddock was to become one of the most surprising sports legends in history. With the Depression going strong in the early 1930s, the impoverished ex-boxer was seemingly as broken-down and out-of-luck as the rest of the America. Driven by love and determination, he returned to the ring. He did not have much of a shot, but James was fueled by something beyond mere competition. He kept winning and suddenly, the ordinary working man became an icon who carried the hopes and dreams of the disenfranchised on his shoulders. Eventually, he rose through the ranks and went on to fight the heavyweight champ, the unstoppable Max Baer. 145 min. <b>DVD 5208</b></dd>

Middleweight boxer, Marcel Cerdan, captures her heart and gives her something to live for, besides her music--at least for a while. Special features: "Stepping into character:" an exclusive behind the scenes look at Marion Cotillard's transformation into Edith Piaf's character, including an interview with the director and award-winning Marion Cotillard; Edith Piaf documentary. 141 min. <b>DVD 8800</b></dd>

<dt><b>Zelig</b> (1983)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Woody Allen. Cast: Woody Allen, Mia Farrow, Susan Sontag, Saul Bellow. This spoof of documentary films stars Woody Allen as Leonard Zelig, the famous "Chameleon Man" of the 1920's, whose personality was so vague he would assume the characteristics of whomever he came into contact with. Filmed in black-and-white, the movie simulates the look of a newsreel, complete with stentorian narration. 79 min. <b>DVD 1014; vhs 999:803</b></dd>
