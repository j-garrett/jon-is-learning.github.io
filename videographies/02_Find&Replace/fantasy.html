<dd>Directed by Robert Stevenson. Cast: Fred MacMurray, Nancy Olson, Keenan Wynn, Tommy Kirk. In this sequel to "The absent minded-Professor," Professor Ned Brainard's discovery of flubber hasn't quite brought him - or his college - the riches he thought. The Pentagon has declared his discovery to be top secret and the IRS has slapped him with a huge tax bill, even if he has yet to receive a cent. He thinks he may have found the solution in the form of flubbergas, which can change the weather. It also helps Medfield College's football team to win a game. Based on a story by Samuel W.

When he is about in the centre of the river, his flying machine explodes, and like the unfortunate McGinty, down goes Weary William." {IMDB) 103 min. <b>DVD X1752 ; vhs Video/C 7046</b></dd>

<dt><b>I've Heard the Mermaids Singing</b> (Canada, 1987)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Patricia Rozema. Cast: Sheila McCarthy, Paule Baillargeon, Ann-Marie MacDonald. "The film stars Sheila McCarthy as Polly, a worker for a temporary secretarial agency. Polly serves as the narrator for the film, and there are frequent sequences portraying her whimsical fantasies. Polly lives alone, seems to have no friends and enjoys solitary bicycle rides to undertake her hobby of photography. Despite being somewhat clumsy, uneducated, socially awkward and inclined to take other's statements literally, all of which has led to scarce employment opportunities, Polly is placed as a secretary in a private art gallery owned by Gabrielle (Paule Baillargeon). Ann-Marie MacDonald plays Mary, who is Gabrielle's former young lover, and also a painter. Mary returns after an absence, and she and Gabrielle rekindle their former relationship despite Gabrielle's misgivings that she is too old and Mary too young. Polly, who's fallen a little bit in love with Gabrielle, is inspired to submit some of her own photographs anonymously to the gallery. She is crushed when Gabrielle dismisses her photos out of hand and calls them "simple minded". Polly temporarily quits the gallery, and goes into a depression. She returns to the gallery, and revives a little when Mary notices one of her photos. Mary and Gabrielle later visit Polly at her flat, and realize that the discarded photographs were by Polly. As the film ends, Gabrielle and Polly look at more of Polly's photographs and in a short fantasy sequence the three are transported together to an idyllic wooded glen."

Everything about this world is exactly like ours, except when Lola fails to save her boyfriend, she says &ldquo;stop&rdquo; and the movie starts over with her running again.

<dd>&#149;<b>The Magic Cloak of Oz</b> (1914)</dd>
<dd>Directed by J. Farrell MacDonald. "The fairies of Oz gather in the forest of Burzee one evening and weave a magic cloak that gives the wearer one wish, so long as it has not been stolen. The man in the moon tells them that their messenger should give it to the first miserable person she sees. Two children, Fluff and her younger brother "Bud" (a child's attempt at "brother," which stuck), have just lost their father and are taken by Aunt Rivette to live in Nole, the capital city of Noland, where the king has just died without heir. The messenger gives Fluff the cloak, who wishes to be happy again, while a legal loophole places Bud on the throne, and they empty the treasury to buy toys. Their pet mule Nickodemus is captured by robbers and puts together a small animal army (including the Cowardly Lion, the Hungry Tiger, the Lonesome Zoop, the Woozy, and others) to battle the Rolly Rogues that have invaded the city. The cloak is nowhere to be found because 683 year old bewitching Queen Zixi of neighboring Ix, has been informed by Quavo the minstrel of the cloaks power, and wants to see herself young and beautiful, as others see her, but she cannot."

<dt><b>Gabriel Over the White House</b> (1933)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Gregory LaCava. Cast: Walter Huston, Karen Morley, Franchot Tone, Arthur Byron, Dickie Moore. United States President Judson Hammond, a corrupt politician, is visited by the Angel Gabriel during recuperation from a near-fatal automobile accident. President Hammond miraculously becomes virtuous, although his zeal for reform is as misguided as his previous indifference was destructive.<br>
"Unsatisfied with status quo politics, filmmakers looked to authoritarian leadership on the left and the right for possible solutions. Dubbed by the trade press as the "dictator craze," these films presented "strong tyrannical personalities who, whatever their flaws as human beings and citizens, at least knew how to take strong action" ... Movies allowed Americans to fantasize about embracing revolutionary leadership, whether left or right, that could take the nation out of hard times. Inspired by events such as the government's brutal attack of peaceful Bonus Army marchers in July 1932, films like The Power and the Glory (1933) and Gabriel Over the White House (1933) dealt with strikes, massive gatherings of the unemployed, massacres by private police or government forces, and dictators who presided over these events, allegedly for the benefit of the nation."

Cast: Matt Damon, C&eacute;cile de France, Jay Mohr, Bryce Dallas Howard, George McLaren, Frankie McLaren,Thierry Neuvic, Marthe Keller, Derek Jacobi, Lyndsey Marshal, Richard Kind, Steven R. Schirripa, Jenifer Lewis. This feature film peers at an intriguing question--is there an afterlife?--through the lens of George, Marie, and Marcus, who are each tortured in different ways by the thought of life after death.

But he fled that life, unable to cope with the emotional burden of his abilities. Marie Lelay is a French TV presenter coping with the intense emotions brought on by a near death experience in the 2004 tsunami in Thailand. She's written a book on the subject, which was greeted with derision by her colleagues. Marcus and Jason live in a London council estate, covering for their mother, who's a hopeless junkie. When Jason meets a sudden and tragic end, Marcus is set hopelessly adrift, and begins obsessively researching psychics and seers who can help him contact Jason on the other side.
