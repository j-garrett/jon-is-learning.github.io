<dt><b>Jack Johnson-Jeffries Fight</b> (1910)</dt>
<dd>"On 4 July, 1910, in 100 degree heat at an outdoor boxing ring near Reno, Nevada, film cameras recorded what was supposed to be the fight of the century. Former heavyweight champion Jim Jeffries was reluctantly brought out of retirement to fight Jack Johnson, a black man. The film begins with the master of ceremonies inviting a few former champs into the ring for perfunctory applause and accolades from the thousands of fight fans in attendance. Then, the referee motions for the opening bell. The fight lasts for 14 grueling rounds, and when it is over, the fallen Great White Hope is on the mat receiving the ten-count. The referee raises Johnson's fists high into the air and, for the first time in history, there was a black heavyweight champion of the world. At least 10 people lost their lives because of Johnson's victory and hundreds more were injured due to white retaliation and wild celebrations in the streets. Public screenings received instantaneous protests and hundreds of cities barred the film from being shown. The United States Congress passed a law making it a federal offense to transport moving pictures of prizefights across a state line, and the most powerful portrayal of a black man ever recorded on film was made virtually invisible."<br>

<dt><b>Damaged Lives</b> (1933)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Edgar G. Ulmer. Cast: Diane Sinclair, Lyman Williams, George Irving, Almeda Fowler, Jason Robards. A rich young man catches syphilis as the result of a wanton night on the town with a rich floozy and passes it on to his wife.<br>
"Known for such distinctive films as The Black Cat, Detour and The Man from Planet X, Edgar Ulmer began his directorial career with the educational oddity Damaged Lives. This updated "hygiene" reeler was produced by the Canadian Social Health Council with Columbia Pictures as the designated studio. In 1937, a New York Times reviewer noted that Damaged Lives was "the decisive stroke in the struggle to free discussion of venereal disease," typically a hushed subject. The medical melodrama follows the momentary folly of a shipping tycoon who contracts syphilis and unwittingly infects his wife. Their lives are a shambles as they quake under the weight of ignorance and resort to quack remedies. Originally, Ulmer's film had an epilogue that consisted of a fact-filled lecture by Dr. Leonard, actor/medical specialist. The film's candid concern for sex education, complete with charts and diagrams, was too much for the New York State Board of Censors, who banned the film from public exhibition."

<dt><b>Ekstase (Ecstasy)</b>(Czechoslovakia / Austria, 1933)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Gustav Machat&yacute;. Cast: Hedy Lamarr, Aribert Moog, Leopold Kramer, Jaromir Rogoz. Eva has just gotten married to an older gentleman, but discovers that he is obsessed with order in his life and doesn't have much room for passion. She becomes despondent and leaves him, returning to her father's house. One day while bathing in the lake she meets a young man and they fall in love. The husband has become grief stricken at the loss of his young bride, and fate brings him together with the young lover that has taken Eva from him. The film was highly controversial in its time largely because of a nude swimming scene. It is also perhaps the first non-pornographic movie to portray sexual intercourse, although never showing more than the actors' faces. It has also been called the first on-screen depiction of a female orgasm. Based on a story by Samuel Cummins.<br>
"This landmark of erotic cinema explores the inner world of a young woman who is married to a sexually repressed man and takes a lover in the countryside. Few censors of the day could see beyond Hedy (Kiesler) Lamarr's famous nude bathing scene. But the film's visual and thematic interest lies elsewhere. Jan Stallich's rich cinematography, which defined the school of Czech lyricism, enhances Machaty's passionate study with long, pensive shots-of movement, as in the famous tracking shot through the forest; of images disposed to psychoanalytic interpretation; of feelings, from longing to bliss, in sustained close-up. Ecstasy is a visual celebration of sexuality, linking the young woman and her desires with the nature that surrounds her: the sublime clouds, the battered trees, the glimmering ponds. Ecstasy was condemned by the Vatican; on these shores it was blocked as "obscene and immoral," the start of a seven-year censorship battle that resulted in an adulterated print-adultery magically turned into marriage."

<dt><b><a name="outlaw" id="outlaw">The Outlaw</a></b> (1943)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Howard Hughes. Cast: Jack Beutel, Jane Russell, Walter Huston, Thomas Mitchell. Presents a provocative retelling of the sagebrush saga of Billy the Kid and Doc Holliday - and their heated rivalry for the love of the sultry Rio - explodes in a gripping and unforgettable climax as their fateful destinies collide with the legendary Sheriff Pat Garrett.<br>
"The most exciting shoot-outs surrounding The Outlaw were those with the heavily armed censors. Not surprising: Howard Hughes had set out to break with the traditional western and compose a story of down-to-earth sex and hair-trigger action. Your basic buddy film, beautifully shot by Gregg Toland, the plot finds Doc Holliday and Billy the Kid becoming partners in a lawless land. Their tenuous friendship is challenged by constant quarrels, first over Doc's horse, Red, then over Doc's girl, Rio. And it was over Rio, played by the as-yet-unknown Jane Russell-or rather Rio's cleavage-that much of the off-screen quarreling raged. A "breast shot deletion" list was compiled, and minor cuts were made. The film opened at San Francisco's Geary Theater in February 1943, was pulled from exhibition in April, and re-released four years later, with Hughes still as confrontational as ever. A Maryland judge declared that Russell's breasts "hung over the picture like a thunderstorm spread over a landscape. They were everywhere." But now, so was the (Sealless) film."

Howard Hughes shocked the film world with this high-voltage western adventure that featured the steamy screen debut of voluptuous Jane Russell. The film's slogan was "What are the two biggest reasons for Jane Russell's success?" During filming, Hughes once commented, "We're not getting enough production from Jane's breasts." The first release of the film in 1941 caused so much indignation that the picture was withdrawn for over five years before its general release.<br>

<dt><b>Pinky</b> (1949)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Elia Kazan. Cast: Jeanne Crain, Ethel Barrymore, Ethel Waters, William Lundigan. Pinky, a black woman who works as a nurse in Boston, finds that she is able to pass for white. Afraid her true heritage will be discovered, she leaves her white fiancee and returns home to Mississippi where she helps her grandmother care for her employer, an imperious plantation owner. When she names Pinky heiress to her estate, the community rises in resentment triggering a-sensational court trial. Subject of a landmark Supreme Court case in film censorship, this moving story became itself a battle for human rights. Originally produced as a motion picture in 1949. Based on the novel Quality by Cid Ricketts Sumner.<br>
"The late forties saw a spate of films dealing with the "Negro problem." Elia Kazan's Pinky was one of the more notable entries, especially for its vanguard interracial romance. The story describes the return to the South of a light-skinned black nurse (Jeanne Crain) who had lived in Boston for twelve years, passing for white. Back with her endearing grandmother (Ethel Waters), Pinky is confronted by the squalid conditions of her home and, more significantly, by her black identity. Her stay exposes her to the double standards of a racist society, in harrowing scenes that never blanch in their indictment of racial inequality. But Kazan's film also has its compromises, most obviously in its choice of a white actress for the lead role. Pinky opened in the South to censorship skirmishes; Marshall, Texas found an exhibitor guilty of presenting a film that was "of such a character as to be prejudicial to the best interests of the people of said City." The case eventually led to a U.S. Supreme Court victory for the film." [<a href="http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/film/FN10044">Pacific Film Archives - Banned in the USA</a>]<br>

<dd>Director: Roberto Rossellini. Cast: Anna Magnani. A homeless woman believes that a man she encounters on a hillside is Saint Joseph; he takes advantage of her. When she discovers she is pregnant, she knows it's a miracle. Other villagers mock her, and she has the baby alone, near a locked church, in the straw of a goat shed. Story by Federico Fellini, based on Valle-Incl&aacute;n's novel "La flor de santidad". Segment of the anthology film <i>L'amore</i>.<br>
"The Miracle was originally exhibited as part of a trilogy, The Ways of Love, with companion pieces by Renoir and Pagnol. In this neorealist masterpiece, Anna Magnani plays a simple-minded peasant who allows a bearded vagabond (played by Federico Fellini, who also wrote the story) to seduce her, thinking he is St. Joseph. She announces the "miracle" of her pregnancy, but is met by scorn from her fellow villagers who clamp a basin on her head for a halo. Rossellini's film was similarly ridiculed and eventually blasted as blasphemous, not in Rome but in Cardinal Spellman's New York, where it was met with pickets and boycotts. Ephraim London, one of the great First Amendment lawyers, argued the case for The Miracle in front of the U.S. Supreme Court and got the miracle the film industry had waited for for thirty-five years: film now had Constitutional protection."

<dd>Director, Otto Preminger. Cast: William Holden, David Niven, Maggie McNamara, Tom Tully, Dawn Addams. Two aging playboys are both after the same attractive young woman, but she fends them off by claiming that she plans to remain a virgin until her wedding night. Both men determine to find a way around her objections.<br>
"An innocuous sex comedy that talks about bedding down but never turns a sheet aptly describes Otto Preminger's independent production. However, the furor surrounding the film leaves the impression that a full-scale orgy had occurred. The Moon Is Blue concerns itself with the attempted seduction of the militantly virtuous Patty O'Neill (played by Audrey Hepburn double Maggie McNamara) by two bachelors, the self-confident Donald (William Holden) and the aging tippler David (David Niven). Deceptively ingenuous, Miss O'Neill manages to outwit her two suitors, disarming them with her aggressively candid queries ("Would you try to seduce me?"). Blue language, daring verbiage like "virgin" and "seduce," is modestly sprinkled throughout the film, but barely a prim kiss is exchanged. The real kiss was a kiss-off: when the Production Code Administration told Preminger The Moon Is Blue wouldn't receive a Seal because of its "moral indifference," he told them he would distribute it anyway. The PCA went into full defensive posture, but like an inept father, the Production Code office was losing control over its "children.""

<img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/nosym2.gif" width="20" height="20" border="0">Banned in Kansas, Ohio, and Maryland. Preminger and United Artists decided to bring suit in a Maryland court. On December 7, 1953, Judge Herman Moser reversed the State Censor Board. In his ruling, he called the film "a light comedy telling a tale of wide-eyed, brash, puppy-like innocence." Preminger and UA then appealed in Kansas, but the state's Supreme Court upheld the state board of review's decision to ban the film. Determined to win, the director and studio took their case to the Supreme Court of the United States, which overturned the finding of the Kansas Supreme Court on October 24, 1955. The success of the film was instrumental in weakening the influence of the Production Code. (It was the first major Hollywood production to be released without the Production Code's seal of approval). On June 27, 1961, the PCA granted both The Moon is Blue and The Man with the Golden Arm, Preminger's similarly controversial 1955 release, the seals of approval they initially withheld.

<dt><b>The Man with the Golden Arm</b> (1955)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Otto Preminger. Cast: Frank Sinatra, Eleanor Parker, Kim Novak. An ex-convict recovering from heroin addiction returns to the Chicago slums and struggles to become a musician, but his former "business associates" have other ideas. Based on the novel by Nelson Algren.<br>
"Just out of prison, card-shark Frankie Machine (Frank Sinatra) is back at his old Chicago haunts. He's left behind his heroin addiction and brought home a new-found talent, jazz drumming. Though determined to begin life anew, he soon succumbs to pressure from his neurotic wife (Eleanor Parker) and a nettle of local hustlers, and is back on the needle, in a wallow of hypo'd despair. The Production Code Administration refused Man with the Golden Arm its Seal because their twenty-five-year-old guidelines forbade even the mention of addictive drugs. And regardless of the film's grim realism, the PCA insinuated that it advocated addiction by demonstrating its use. Frankie's tragic decline and the harrowing "cold turkey" sequence in which he tears at the walls of his friend Molly (Kim Novak)'s apartment should have been enough to leave anyone cold about drugs. Oddly, the Legion of Decency was cooler under the collar than the PCA. To appease their minor complaints, Preminger merely cut thirty seconds-getting rid of the drug paraphernalia-from the film's sole fix scene."

<img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/nosym2.gif" width="20" height="20" border="0">"Once the onscreen battles were complete, the off-screen battle with the censors began. Most of Albee's salty language had been retained for the film version, and Warner and Lehman had agreed not to shoot alternative takes for provocative scenes that might raise the eyebrows of the industry's self-censorship group, the Motion Picture Association of America's Production Code Review Board. The Catholic Church's censorship group had passed the film with a rating of "Morally unobjectionable for adults, with reservations." Yet at first, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? was denied a Production Code Seal of Approval. Warner stood behind the film, saying "The play was undoubtedly a play for adults and we have gone ahead to make Virginia Woolf a film for adults. I don't believe a controversial, mature subject should be watered down so that it is palatable for children. When that is done, you get a picture which is not palatable for children or for anyone else." He then announced that all contracts with theaters would include a clause prohibiting anyone under 18 from seeing the film unless accompanied by an adult. It was the first time Warners had ever released a film for adults only. The film got the Seal. Four months after Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? opened, the MPAA announced a less rigid Production Code."

<img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/nosym2.gif" width="20" height="20" border="0">On January 13, 1972, the police in Albany, Georgia served a search warrant on a theatre showing the film <i>Carnal Knowledge</i>. The film was seized, and in March 1972, the theatre manager, Mr. Jenkins, was convicted of the crime of "distributing obscene material". His conviction was upheld by the Supreme Court of Georgia. On June 24, 1974, the U.S. Supreme Court would find that the State of Georgia had gone too far in classifying material as obscene in view of its prior decision in <a href="#miller"><i>Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973)</i></a> (the Miller standard), and would overturn the conviction. <i>Jenkins v. Georgia, 418 U.S. 153 (1974).</i> The court also said that, "Our own viewing of the film satisfies us that Carnal Knowledge could not be found ... to depict sexual conduct in a patently offensive way. Nothing in the movie falls within &hellip; material which may constitutionally be found ... "patently offensive" - While the subject matter of the picture is, in a broader sense, sex, and there are scenes in which sexual conduct including "ultimate sexual acts" is to be understood to be taking place, the camera does not focus on the bodies of the actors at such times. There is no exhibition whatever of the actors' genitals, lewd or otherwise, during these scenes. There are occasional scenes of nudity, but nudity alone is not enough to make material legally obscene&hellip; Appellant's showing of the film Carnal Knowledge is simply not the "public portrayal of hard core sexual conduct for its own sake, and for the ensuing commercial gain" which we said was punishable."<br>

"Again, pickets and boycotts: the furor from the religious right over Godard's 1985 Hail Mary was nothing compared to that provoked by Scorsese's mini-epic about the King of Kings. Based on the Kazantzakis novel, The Last Temptation of Christ is not so much a reappraisal of Christ's martyrdom as it is a fleshing-out of the possibilities of his spiritual journey. In Scorsese's film, Christ is a troubled and unlikely savior. Willem Dafoe's earthy portrayal of Christ has him wrestling-body and soul-with the fearsome burden of divinity. In the most disputed sequence of the film, an agonized, gruesomely crucified Christ succumbs to a tormented hallucination in which he weds Mary Magdalene and sires her children. This arresting vignette crystallizes the profundity of the last temptation: Christ's sacrifice is made meaningful in his renunciation of human desire. The Last Temptation of Christ was met by vehement attacks focused on the film's alleged blasphemy-condemnations voiced by religious leaders, many of whom had never seen the film."

<h3><a name="xrated" id="xrated">Notable Films Rated X and NC-17 by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA)</a></h3>
<br>
The MPAA X-rating designated mature themes for audiences over the age of 17 or 18. The content of the film was deemed to have graphic sex, violence and language (in any combination). Arguably this rating was over-used by the industry and often rang the death-knell for a film. The content of some films may have had minimal sequences of such concerns but which, for artistic reasons, were integral to the film. The problem was that all skin flicks, nudies and pornographic films were also rated X. X ratings turned audiences away from some qualitative films. When a number of filmmakers chose to release their movies without an MPAA rating rather than let them be labelled X, the MPAA introduced the NC-17 (not for children 17 or under) rating on September 27, 1990 to differentiate MPAA-approved adult-oriented films from unapproved X-rated movies.</dd>

<dt><b>Henry &amp; June</b>(1990)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Philip Kaufman. Cast: Fred Ward, Uma Thurman, Maria de Medeiros, Richard E. Grant, Kevin Spacey. Upon meeting unconventional American author Henry Miller in Paris in 1931, a young writer named Anais Nin boldly embarks on a passionate voyage of self-discovery, and faithfully records every experience in her diary.<br>
"For some, experience is a confirmation of corporeal existence; for others, it's the raw material of the spirit. Henry &amp; June celebrates the latter, following the exploits of writers Henry Miller and Ana&iuml;s Nin in the Paris of the 1930s. Adapted from Nin's book, this intellectualized account envisions the famed authors as adventurers in the skin trade. Here, art is the act of converting a caress into a phrase. Between Henry (Fred Ward) and Ana&iuml;s (Maria de Medeiros) stands the menacing and voluptuous June (Uma Thurman), Henry's wife. For a time, the bedding is emboldened by June and Ana&iuml;s. But heterosexual love has no primacy-beyond the embrace of man or woman lies the possibility of art. And it is this possibility that electrifies Henry &amp; June, giving it an odd innocence in its embrace of eros. In 1990, the heated debate over the MPAA's rating system came to full boil. Henry &amp; June was among several distinguished films given the distribution-stifling X-and the one to make MPAA president Jack Valenti announce a new NC-17 rating."

A Texas "cowboy" takes a bus to New York in search of lonely, rich women who will pay for his sexual services, but instead spends a hard winter looking after a dying derelict. Vito Russo has commented: When buddy films returned in the late Sixties, the presence onscreen of homosexual characters was a perfect way of saying, 'Oh, no, /this isn't what we mean at all.' Homosexuals drew suspicion away from the buddies--it was yardstick time again." (<i>The Celluloid Closet</i>, p. 80-83) <b>DVD 5254</b></dd>

<b>X</b>The only X-rated film ever to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. At the time the X-rating did not have the stigma it later took on. Midnight Cowboy has also been deemed "culturally significant" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. Due to a degree of relaxation in attitudes regarding sex in film, the (unchanged) film has since been re-rated "R" in the 1970s.</dd>

<dt>&#149;<b>Mutual Film Corporation v. Industrial Commission of Ohio, 236 U.S. 230 (1915)</b> United States Supreme Court case in which, in a 9-0 vote, the Court ruled that the free speech protection of the Ohio Constitution &mdash; which was substantially similar to the First Amendment of the United States Constitution &mdash; did not extend to motion pictures.<br>
The state government of Ohio had passed a statute in 1913 forming a board of censors which had the duty of reviewing and approving all films intended to be exhibited in the state. The board charged a fee for the approval service. The board could order the arrest of anyone showing an unapproved film in the state.<br>
The Court stated: "&hellip;the exhibition of moving pictures is a business, pure and simple, originated and conducted for profit &hellip; not to be regarded, nor intended to be regarded by the Ohio Constitution, we think, as part of the press of the country, or as organs of public opinion."<br>
The Court described movies in some technical detail and noted their popularity, but wrote "they may be used for evil," and for this reason, "We cannot regard [the censorship of movies] as beyond the power of government." The Court added it would be equally unreasonable to grant free speech protection to the theater or the circus, and noted that in many prior cases regarding government licensure of theatrical performances, the issue of freedom of opinion had not been raised.

<dt>&#149;<a name="burstyn" id="burstyn"></a><b>Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 343 U.S. 495(1952)</b> US Supreme Court case that determined that certain provisions of the New York Education Law allowing a censor to forbid the commercial showing of any non-licensed motion picture film, or revoke or deny the license of a film deemed to be "sacrilegious," was a "restraint on freedom of speech" and thereby a violation of the First Amendment. By way of this, the decision defined film as an artistic medium protected by the Constitution's guarantee of free speech. In so doing, the Court overturned its previous decision in Mutual Film Corporation v. Industrial Commission of Ohio (1915), which found that movies were not an art form worthy of First Amendment protection, but merely a business.

<dt>&#149;<b>Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476 (1957)</b> A landmark case before the United States Supreme Court which redefined the Constitutional test for determining what constitutes obscene material unprotected by the First Amendment. The Court repudiated [prior legal tests] and defined obscenity more strictly, as material whose "dominant theme taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest" to the "average person, applying contemporary community standards." Only material meeting this test could be banned as "obscene." However, Justice Brennan reaffirmed that obscenity was not protected by the First Amendment and thus upheld the convictions of Roth and Alberts for sending obscene material over the mail. Congress could ban material, "utterly without redeeming social importance," or in other words, "whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest." With the Court unable to agree as to what constituted obscenity, the Justices were put in the position of having to personally review almost every obscenity prosecution in the United States, with the Justices gathering for weekly screenings of "obscene" motion pictures Meanwhile, pornography and sexually oriented publications proliferated as a result of the Warren Court's holdings, the "Sexual Revolution" of the 1960s flowered, and pressure increasingly came to the Court to allow leeway for state and local governments to crack down on obscenity. During his ill-fated bid to become Chief Justice, Justice Abe Fortas was attacked vigorously in Congress by conservatives such as Strom Thurmond for siding with the Warren Court majority in liberalizing protection for pornography. In his 1968 presidential campaign, Richard Nixon campaigned against the Warren Court, pledging to appoint "strict constructionists" to the Supreme Court.

<dt>&#149;<b><a name="jacobellis" id="jacobellis">Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184 (1964)</a></b> A United States Supreme Court decision handed down in 1964 involving whether the state of Ohio could, consistent with the First Amendment, ban the showing of a French film called <a href="#amants">The Lovers (Les Amants)</a> which the state had deemed obscene. Nico Jacobellis, manager of the Heights Art Theatre in the Coventry Village neighborhood of Cleveland Heights, Ohio, was convicted and fined $2500 by a judge of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas for exhibiting the film, and his conviction was upheld by the Supreme Court of Ohio. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the conviction, 6 to 3, ruling that the film was not obscene and hence constitutionally protected. The most famous opinion from ...was Justice Potter Stewart's concurrence, holding that the Constitution protected all obscenity except "hard-core pornography." Stewart wrote, "I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description; and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But I know it when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that." [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobellis_v._Ohio">Wikipedia</a>]<br></dt>

<dt>&#149;<b>Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. Dallas 390 U.S. 676 (1968)</b> Interstate Circuit, a distributor of motion pictures, was prohibited by the city of Dallas from distributing a film entitled "Viva Maria". Pursuant to a 1965 city ordinance, the Motion Picture Classification Board of the City of Dallas classified the film as "not suitable for young persons" because it contained objectionable instances of "sexual promiscuity". On appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, Interstate challenged the determination of both the county court and the appeals court of Texas that the classification of the Motion Picture Classification Board should stand. The court's ruling was a backhanded decision that favored the theater circuit but added that if the city were to improve its system, such cases might be decided in its favor in the future. In short, the court said to Dallas: Come back with a case in which you limit your censorship to films that children can legally watch, and you will find a more favorable atmosphere here. Within five months the Motion Picture Association of America had created a classification system to meet the Supreme Court guidelines. The industry, said Jack Valenti, head of the MPAA, would police itself by voluntarily designating certain films as inappropriate for children and younger teen-agers and then instructing theater managers to enforce the classification. By November 1 of that year the system was in place.<br></dt>

<dt>&#149;<a name="miller" id="miller"></a><b>Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973)</b> U.S. Supreme Court cases that determined whether the sale and distribution of obscene materials by mail is protected under the First Amendment's freedom of speech guaranteed. The Court ruled that it was not. It indicated that "obscene material is not protected by the First Amendment", thereby reaffirming part of Roth. The government can outlaw material based on the following standard: "whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value." However, the Court acknowledged "the inherent dangers of undertaking to regulate any form of expression," and said that "State statutes designed to regulate obscene materials must be carefully limited." The Court, in an attempt to set such limits devised a set of three criteria which must be met in order for a work to be legitimately subject to state regulation:<br></dt>
<dd>* The average person, applying contemporary community standards (not national standards, as some prior tests required), must find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest;</dd>
<dd>* The work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct or excretory functions[1] specifically defined by applicable state law; and</dd>
<dd>* The work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.<br>
This obscenity test overturns the definition of obscenity set out in the Memoirs decision, which held that "all ideas having even the slightest redeeming social importance . . . have the full protection of the guaranties [of the First Amendment]" and that obscenity was that which was "utterly without redeeming social importance."
