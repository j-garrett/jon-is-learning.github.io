<dt><b>America's War on Poverty.</b></dt>
<dd>Produced and directed by Susan Bellows. Produced by Blackside, Inc. 57 min ea.<br></dd>
<dd>&#149;<b>In this Affluent Society.</b> In the early 1960s, hundreds of Kentucky coal miners are displaced by machines and strike out at their former employers. Millions of others displaced by machines across Appalachia and the rural South head north to begin a new life in Chicago, where they face overcrowded tenements and schools, and the familiar inequities of segregation. This program recounts these stories of desperation and hope and explores the origins of the federal government's war on poverty and how attitudes toward race and faith in the accessibility of the American dream shape the battle plans for the nation's greatest effort to reduce poverty. <b>DVD 9790 [preservation copy]; vhs Video/C 3926</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149;<b>Given a Chance.</b> Early 1965 is a critical period for President Johnson's war on poverty. The Office of Economic Opportunity's goal to have the poor themselves design and run anti-poverty programs attracts strong opposition from local and state governments. Head Start is created to provide poor children with adequate nutrition, health care and the educational advantages that other American children enjoy. This program focuses on the Head Start program in Mississippi. <b>DVD 9791 [preservation copy]; vhs Video/C 3927</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149;<b>City of Promise.</b> The context for the war on poverty shifts after 1965. Urban rebellions provoke a sense of urgency for some, while others now see the war against poverty as hopeless. Increasingly, the media and the public equate poverty with inner-city black communities. This program looks at the anger and despair of the poor and the powerless, and the anger and frustration of the middle class at having to pay for "others' mistakes." It also examines attempts made in Newark, New Jersey, to reclaim the inner city through public/private partnerships. <b>DVD 9792 [preservation copy]; vhs Video/C 3928</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>In Service to America.</b> By 1967, poverty warriors increase the sophistication of their tactics at the same time that a number of outspoken opponents rise to national prominence. This program highlights the beginning of Legal Services and VISTA, two programs that combined individual action with the idea of volunteerism. Lawyers team up with migrant farm workers in California to fight for better education, health care and working conditions, and VISTA volunteers and local residents organize against strip mining in Appalachia. Both stories raise significant questions about activities the government funds in the name of fighting poverty. <b>DVD 9793 [preservation copy]; vhs Video/C 3929</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149;<b>My Brother's Keeper.</b> The Nixon Administration and the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO) bring the nation to the brink of overhauling the federal social security system and replacing welfare with a guaranteed income for all citizens. When it appears the guaranteed income will be quite low, the NWRO joins an alliance of conservatives and liberals to defeat the proposed legislation. <b>DVD 9794 [preservation copy]; vhs Video/C 3930</b><br>

<dd>&#149; <b>Segregation -- Northern Style</b> In many places above the Mason-Dixon Line, a subtle form of bigotry was at work during the early 1960s, resisting the efforts of Afro-Americans to buy homes in historically white neighborhoods. In this 1964 program, Mike Wallace reveals the fallacies, attitudes and weak legislation that contributed to de facto segregation in the North by tracking the unsuccessful compaign of a middle-class black family to buy in upscale New Jersey. The positive contributions of fair housing and civil rights groups are also presented.Reporter: Mike Wallace.

<dd>&#149; <b>Black Power -- White Backlash</b> When the radical wing of the civil rights movement began equating redress with rebellion rather than nonviolent protest, "Black power" became the rallying cry.

<dd>&#149; <b>Volume 1, Opening Plenary</b></dd>
<dd>SNCC Advisor, Timothy Jenkins opens the conference explaining that this is not simply a gathering of reminiscence, but a coming together to provide "missing chapters in history" to a new generation of freedom fighters. Following Jenkins is a vivid and substantive description of SNCC's birth and impact given by Professor Julian Bond, retired NAACP Board of Directors Chair, who participated in SNCC's 1960 founding conference. An important lesson that emerges from this opening session is that while SNCC Veterans do not define themselves as heroes and heroines, serious and effective struggle requires commitment, and commitment often involves risk. Speakers: Chuck McDew (Former SNCC Chairman), Charles Meeker (Raleigh Mayor), Timothy Jenkins (SNCC Executive Committee Member), Judy Richardson (SNCC Field Secretary), Hollis Watkins (SNCC Field Staff), Julian Bond (SNCC Communications Director), William J. Barber (President NC-NAACP) 100 min. <b>DVD X5468</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Volume 2, Early Student Movement Philosophy and Activism</b></dd>
<dd>While deep dissatisfaction was a major factor mobilizing the young people who would engage in direct action protests, often the first steps into activism led to a greater-than-anticipated commitment. Adult mentoring played a large role; adults who had long been struggling for change supported young activists and helped expand their view of the world. Speakers: Muriel Tillinghast (SNCC Field Secretary), David Dennis (Congress of Racial Equality aka CORE), Joan T. Mulholland (student, Tougaloo College), Johnny Parham (Atlanta Student Movement) 53 min. <b>DVD X5469</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Volume 3, From Student Activists to Field Organizers</b></dd>
<dd>The most remarkable aspect of the civil disobedience and sit-ins of the 1960s was the leadership of young people. Importantly, young activists were challenging other young people to join them, and also challenging established civil rights organizations to speed up the pace of their efforts. Their commitment and energy led to the grassroots organizing work that defined the freedom movement of the 1960s. In this session, panelists discuss their deepening involvement with the Southern Movement as grassroots community organizers. Harry Belafonte makes an unscheduled appearance in the session. Speakers: Charlie Cobb (SNCC Field Secretary), Jean Wheeler Young (SNCC Field Secretary), Chuck McDew (SNCC Chairman), Dorie Ladner (SNCC Field Secretary), Wendell Paris (SNCC Field Secretary), Wazir "Willie" Peacock (SNCC Field Secretary) 68 min. <b>DVD X5470</b><br></dd>

<dd>This session presents a behind-the-scenes look at the people and elements that kept SNCC running as an organization. The panelists, former SNCC staffers (many of whom also worked "in the field" as well), represent some of the glue that held SNCC together as an organization. Their work was vital in addressing communications to transportation and the provision of other resources for SNCC members. Speakers: Karen Spellman (SNCC Research Department), Judy Richardson (SNCC Field Secretary), Betty Garman Robinson (SNCC Atlanta Headquarters), Margaret Lauren Herring (SNCC Atlanta Headquarters), Tamio Wakayama (SNCC Photographer), Freddie Greene Biddle (SNCC Field Secretary) 77 min. <b>DVD X5471</b><br></dd>

Speakers: Cash Michaels (Editor, The Carolinian), McLouis Clayton (Professor, Shaw University), George C. Debnam (Board of Trustees Shaw University). 78 min. <b>DVD X5472</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Volume 6, Luncheon Keynote: Rev. James Lawson, "We Have Not Yet Arrived"</b></dd>
<dd>At SNCC's founding conference in 1960 it was Rev. James Lawson who captured the political imagination of the students. In this address Lawson outlines his belief in the continuing value and necessity of non-violent struggle for social change and justice. "The power and energy of the 1960s movement is needed for the 21st century." 41 min. <b>DVD X5473</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Volume 7, The Societal Response to SNCC</b></dd>
<dd>This panel and audience discussion considers the complex response to SNCC by the general public and specific sections of society. SNCC's work inspired many students, and the organization found considerable support in groups like the National Student Association and the Students for a Democratic Society. Within this discussion, a larger question is also raised and considered: What should we do today? Speakers: Larry Rubin (SNCC Field Secretary), John Doar (Former Head, Justice Department - Civil Rights Division), Timothy Jenkins (SNCC Executive Committee Member), Peniel Joseph (Professor, Tufts University), Dorothy M. Zellner (SNCC Atlanta Headquarters) 82 min. <b>DVD X5474</b><br></dd>

<dd>&#149; <b>Volume 10, Moving on Mississippi: "We Had to be Strong"</b></dd>
<dd>Not unexpectedly, some of the Southern Movement's most vivid stories are found in Mississippi. Panelist Lawrence Guyot, former Chair of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), insists that Mississippi is the state that "made the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee." This panel features the first-personal accounts of some of the Movement's most unsung heroes and heroines. The significance and impact of the MFDP forms an important part of the discussion. Speakers: Owen Brooks (Delta Ministry Mississippi), Brenda Travis (Pike County Non-Violent Movement), Hollis Watkins (SNCC Field Secretary), Lawrence Guyot (Chair, MFDP), Willie Blue (SNCC Field Secretary), Michael Sistrom (Historian). 80 min. <b>DVD X5477</b><br></dd>

Project Director, Charles Sherrod gives a vivid description of dealing with fear in rural terrain that was as vicious and violent as any place in Mississippi. This session concludes an appearance by Shirley Sherrod who recounts her recent victorious effort to win compensation for black farmers long discriminated against by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Speakers: SNCC Field Secretaries: Donald Harris, Penny Patch, Rutha Harris, Sam Mahone, John Perdew ; SNCC Project Director Charles Sherrod. 76 min. <b>DVD X5479</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Volume 13, Arkansas, Cambridge, MD, Danville, VA: "Everybody Say Freedom"</b></dd>
<dd>Panelists reflect on the events in Danville -- the "Last Capital of the Confederacy" -- where SNCC engaged in dramatic protest against segregation and experimented with economic challenge. The panel discusses the significant and unique struggle in Cambridge, Maryland where the protests were led by an older woman from a prominent family. In addition to fighting to end segregation, Cambridge's agenda included health care, housing and work-force issues. Arkansas may have been the only place in the South where SNCC was invited in by a semi-official organization. Speakers: Avon Rollins (SNCC Field Secretary), Bill Hanson (SNCC Project Director Arkansas), Ivanhoe Donaldson (SNCC Field Secretary), Matthew Jones (SNCC Staff/Freedom Singer). 83 min. <b>DVD X5480</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Volume 14, The Impact and Influence of SNCC on American Society, 1960 to 1968.</b></dd>
<dd>Panelists present insights on SNCC drawn from their years of careful study of the Southern Freedom Movement. Clayborne Carson, author of "In Struggle: SNCC and the Awakening of Black America," describes the outbreak of sit-ins as the "beginning of a new period of struggle." Charles Payne, (whose book, "I've Got the Light of Freedom" is a definitive work on Mississippi's freedom struggle), says "SNCC convinced people they could step into roles they had never played before." SNCC's national impact was great, the panel agrees, but author Taylor Branch wonders why the organization's importance remains so little-recognized. Speakers: Vincent Harding (SNCC and SCLC Advisor), Charles Payne (Professor, University of Chicago), Taylor Branch (Author), Clayborne Carson (Professor, Stanford University), Tom Hayden (Students for a Democratic Society). 116 min. <b>DVD X5481</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Volume 15, What Was SNCC? How Did It Evolve Over the Years? Why Did It Cease to Exist? Imprint [San</b></dd>
<dd>This panel probes the complex evolution of SNCC: the radicalizing effect of its style of grassroots organizing, its disillusionment with establishment politics, the attacks on SNCC by former liberal allies and more conservative black civil rights organizations, and the government's COINTELPRO assault. SNCC's own political naivet?is also discussed. Panelists include SNCC veterans from different eras in the organization's history. Speakers: Joyce Ladner (Tougaloo College Activist), Timothy Jenkins (SNCC Executive Committee Member), Cleveland Sellers (SNCC Program Secretary), Zohorah Simmons (SNCC Field Secretary). 102 min. <b>DVD X5482</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Volume 16, What Was SNCC? How Did It Evolve Over the Years? Why Did It Cease to Exist?</b></dd>
<dd>SNCC's impact on elections across the nation is still little known, but the changes unfolding in the South helped accelerate an emerging black electoral surge in America. Ivanhoe Donaldson explains how Julian Bond's successful campaign for a seat in the Georgia state legislature resulted in a call for assistance from Richard Hatcher who would win his campaign to become Mayor of Gary, Indiana. Courtland Cox uses the "regime change" resulting from SNCC's work in Lowndes County, Alabama as a case study. Speakers: Ivanhoe Donaldson (SNCC Field Secretary), Courtland Cox (SNCC Program Secretary), Julian Bond (SNCC Communications Director). 95 min. <b>DVD X5483</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Volume 17, Luncheon Keynote: Harry Belafonte, "Why Can't Our Children Find Us?"</b></dd>
<dd>Harry Belafonte challenges SNCC members to resist sinking into sentimentalism but instead ask "What can we do with our lives using that same kind of commitment and determination to continue the important work of transforming the United States into a 'more perfect' union?" Belafonte holds up his new organization, the Gathering for Justice, which consists of an intergenerational group of activists, as a model. He implores SNCC Veterans to join the organization and ask themselves "Where are we, who are we talking to, and what are we talking about?" 65 min. <b>DVD X5484</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Volume 18, Ella Baker's Roots: "Give People Light and They Will Find a Way"</b></dd>
<dd>This panel examines the legacy of Ella Baker, the inspiration behind the original SNNC founding conference. Rev. William Barber, discusses his campaign to formalize Ella Baker's legacy in North Carolina by commemorating her birthday as "Ella Baker Day," and declaring her home in Littleton, North Carolina a historic site. The session closes with a powerful rendition of Ella Baker's favorite song, "Guide my feet while I run this race" performed by Bernice Johnson Reagon of Sweet Honey in the Rock. Speakers: Rev. William Barber (Chair, North Carolina NAACP), Timothy Tyson (Author), Carolyn Brockington (Ella Baker's grandniece) 81 min. <b>DVD X5485</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Volume 19, Depictions of the Movement in Popular Culture</b></dd>
<dd>Over the years, the popular media has had a troubled relationship with organizations like SNCC. Hollywood film director Phil Alden Robinson maintains that a big challenge to producing freedom movement films for theatrical distribution is the assumption that the films won't sell overseas. The entertainment values that drive the news limit the depiction of day-to-day grassroots organizing to dramatic protests. However, "media" is no longer defined as exclusively Hollywood, network television or mainstream print media. "Young people especially", says photographer Maria Varela, "are not just cultural consumers but culture-makers." Speakers: Jennifer Lawson Gittens (Activist), Judy Richardson (SNCC National Office Atlanta), Danny Lyon (SNCC Staff Photographer), Charlie Cobb (SNCC Field Secretary), Chuck Neblett (SNCC Freedom Singer), Maria Varela (SNCC Field Secretary), Phil Alden Robinson (Film Director) 95 min. <b>DVD X5486</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Volume 20, Black Power, Black Education and Pan Africanism.</b></dd>
<dd>Throughout the ten years of its formal organizational existence, SNCC did a variety of things it felt necessary: sit-ins, freedom rides, campaigns aimed at the desegregation of public facilities, voter registration drives and the organizing of political parties. Doing what is necessary is a tradition of Black struggle. Pan Africanism, independent Black education and empowerment are all foundations of the Black struggle. In this context of deep political and cultural currents, we look at SNCC in relation to the political struggles of the 1960s. In addition, we look at the institutions beyond U.S. borders which SNCC's ideas helped inform. Speakers: Courtland Cox (SNCC Program Director), Geri Augusto (Secretariat, 6th Pan African Congress), Gregory Carr (Professor, Howard University), Sylvia Hill (6th Pan African Congress), Howard Moore (SNCC Attorney). 89 min. <b>DVD X5487</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Volume 21, Black Power, Black Education and Pan Africanism.</b></dd>
<dd>This session looks at what made SNCC "radical" by focusing on the people who worked with SNCC. The session also addresses the emergence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. Although 96 percent of its members were denied the right to vote, the MFDP transformed not only Mississippi politics, but the rules of the national Democratic Party. "It is the greatest example of small-democracy that we have," says Professor Wesley Hogan. Former MFDP Chairman, Lawrence Guyot, gives a detailed presentation of the MFDP and its challenges in 1964 and 1965. MFDP Attorney Armand Derfner describes the Party's continuing impact, focusing on the Voting Rights Act. Former SNCC Field Secretary, MacArthur Cotton, describes the step-by-step process involved in organizing the MFDP. Speakers: Lawrence Guyot (Chair MFDP), Michael Thelwell (Director, Washington Office MFDP), Armand Derfner (MFDP Attorney), Wesley Hogan (Professor, Virginia State University), MacArthur Cotton (SNCC Field Secretary) 96 min. <b>DVD X5488</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Volume 22, Women Leaders and Organizers: "You Can Do This"</b></dd>
<dd>This panel looks critically at the challenges that women overcame to perform a range of work done for SNCC. Women stepped forward as never before in the ranks of civil rights organizations. "You went ahead and learned how to do it and did it," says one panelist. Ruby Doris Smith Robinson, the woman who actually ran SNCC is discussed; also the "profound" influence of Ella Baker. Speakers: Frances Beal (SNCC Black Women's Liberation Committee), Mary King (SNCC Atlanta National Headquarters), Cynthia Fleming (Professor, University of Tennessee), Doris Derby (Free Southern Theater), Maria Varela (SNCC Field Secretary), Martha Prescod Norman Noonan (SNCC Field Secretary) 96 min. <b>DVD X5489</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Volume 23, The Black Church and Black Struggle</b></dd>
<dd>The Black church was born in struggle in the midst of slavery, and despite laws and vigilante actions targeting it for destruction the church has not only survived, but has played a sustained and central role over more than 300 years of Black struggle in America. This panel of Black churchmen, with very active audience participation, reflects and examines the historical role of the church, its specific role in the Movement of the 1960s, and the lessons of that struggle for today. Speakers: Rev. Bernard Lafayette (SNCC Field Secretary), Rev. Nelson Johnson (Student Organization for Black Unity), Rev. David Forbes (Raleigh Student Movement) 90 min. <b>DVD X5490</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Volume 24, Highlander, SSOC and Organizing in the White Community: "We Knew That We Were Not Free."</b></dd>
<dd>Though Black-led and powered by the energy of the Black population, Whites have always been part of the Southern Freedom Movement. Indeed, as all the panelists note, in its largest sense the southern struggle was not just for Black-only freedom. Three "White" organizations were of particular importance to SNCC: The Highlander Center founded in the 1930s to begin addressing the needs of poor Appalachian Whites embraced the civil rights struggle providing one of the few southern sites for integrated discussion and planning; the Southern Conference Educational Fund (SCEF) which reflected a White southern radical organizing tradition and was one of SNCC's earliest supporters; and finally, the Southern Student Organizing Committee (SSOC), young White southerners who took seriously SNCC's call for Whites to organize White communities. The panel discusses the work of all these organizations as well as the remarkable success of the Washington, DC-based Jews for Urban Justice organization which also developed in response to SNCC's work. Speakers: Bob Zellner (SNCC Field Secretary), Sue Thrasher (Southern Students Organizing Committee), Sharlene Kranz (SNCC Staff), Margaret Lauren Herring (COFO Worker), Candie Carawan (Highlander Center), Ed Hamlett (White Southern Students Project) 97 min. <b>DVD X5491</b><br></dd>

Northern poets Amiri Baraka and Haki Madhubuti, describe the intersection and interaction between the southern struggle, its activists, and the nationwide Black arts movement in which they were key actors. The session examines the continuing engagement with the power of word and song. Speakers: Moderator, A.B.

<dd>&#149; <b>Volume 26, Plenary: Joyce Ladner</b></dd>
<dd>Joyce Ladner is introduced by her sister Dorie Ladner. Both were deeply involved with SNCC in Mississippi. Joyce and Dorie's parents were like many African American parents in that they understood how to survive under Jim Crow and constantly worried about the welfare of their children. Nevertheless, the Ladners taught their children not to accept insult and, in their own way, acted as a supportive rearguard. NAACP Mississippi Field Secretary Medgar Evers was a profound influence on both Ladner sisters. Joyce Ladner traces her roots in the tiny Black community of Palmers Crossing to civil rights activism.

<dd>John Lewis, Chair of SNCC from 1963 to 1966, has been a member of Congress for 24 years. Jailed 40 times and badly beaten several times during civil rights protests, Lewis became deeply involved with the sit-in movement. "We did what young people do so well," says Lewis. "We got in the way." His address is filled with reminiscence, acknowledging old friends in SNCC and invoking the Movement martyrs. His years in Congress and the election of Barack Obama, says Lewis, does not negate the need to continue the struggle. "You're not too old to fight, to push. It's in your blood, in your DNA. Stand up and make some noise." 53 min. <b>DVD X5495</b><br></dd>

Fourth grade reading scores are being used to project prison needs in some states. Every day 192 children are arrested for violent crimes; 393 are arrested daily on drug charges. This panel traces the path to prison that many minority children begin traveling in early childhood. Carmen Perez, now involved with The Gathering for Justice organized by Harry Belafonte, vividly portrays the gang world that surrounded her childhood in a community outside of Los Angeles, saying how "lucky" she was to have someone "invest" in her.

<dd>Members of this panel insist that SNCC continues to influence their work. "We know that not only policy must be changed," says Jonathan Lewis of the Gathering for Justice, "but the attitudes that support our work." Another panelist, Djuan Coleon of the National Alliance of Faith and Justice says 17 states are following SNCC's footsteps and trying to take grassroots organization into education.

<dd>"When you finally get a Black President you get a nice, polite, well-behaved educated one who ain't mad." Gregory was one of a handful of prominent entertainers who consistently supported SNCC. And he was one of the very few of this handful who regularly put his own life on the line. As he explains it: "I made all the money I needed to make, then I bumped into y'all and found out that there's another bank." Dick Gregory acknowledges recent progress in modern politics while addressing continuing problems . 67 min. <b>DVD X5500</b><br></dd>

<dd>SNCC and the Southern Movement have lost a lot of important people over the years both from political assassinations and natural causes. Charles Sherrod's moving version of "One more time" incorporates the names and photos of heroes in a moving tribute to their work. Ella Baker's grandniece, Dr. Carolyn Brockington, discusses her "Aunt Ella." Constancia "Dinky" Romilly tells of the COINTELPRO poisoning of her husband, SNCC Executive Director, James Forman, and how he "healed himself."

<dd>As a college student at San Francisco State in 1968 Glover recounts that "SNCC articulated my own rebelliousness." He recalls the campus struggle for an ethnic studies department and explains that SNCC "taught us organizing." Glover elaborates on what he considers to be the new era of struggle in the 21st century. "We are world citizens today", says Glover, "and 2.5 billion people in this world are living on less than one dollar a day." Climate change, immigration, global rights for workers, are complex challenges. With the United States so dominant, African Americans--"the moral center of this country"-- have to find ways to be active in these struggles. 75 min. <b>DVD X5502</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Volume 36, Freedom Concert.</b></dd>
<dd>This session is full of the sound and power of movement song. Bernice Johnson Reagon explains the origin of the SNCC Freedom Singers. She introduces a brief video of Cordell Reagon who organized the singers with Charles Sherrod. Many well known activists participate in the session including Guy Carawan who introduced "We Shall Overcome" to SNCC in 1960. Folk singer Len Chandler, a regular presence at protests and rallies, explains singing freedom songs: "When you hear something twice, sing it!" Harry Belafonte leads the audience in his famous Banana Boat Song. SNCC's own anthem, "We'll Never Turn Back," written by Georgia activist Bertha Gober, closes out the gathering. 108 min. <b>DVD X5503</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Volume 37, Plenary: Bob Moses, "We the People."</b></dd>
<dd>In 1960 as director of the SNCC's Mississippi Project, Bob Moses traveled to the South to try to register black voters. In 1982 he received a MacArthur Fellowship, and used the money to create the Algebra Project, a foundation devoted to improving minority education in math. "Lack of education" says Moses, was the "subtext" of the voting rights struggle. "We won the right to vote; the fight for public accommodations, but not education. And in that way, though Blacks are citizens, they are second class citizens." The current fight, Moses explains, is for quality public education as a constitutional right. He introduces Albert Sykes who began working with Moses in Jackson, Mississippi more than a decade ago. Featured speaker: Bob Moses ; introduction, David Dennis. 57 min. <b>DVD X5504</b><br></dd>
<dd>&#149; <b>Volume 38, Closing Program: Bernice Johnson Reagon, "Solidarity of Past, Present and Future"</b></dd>
<dd>"What you hear in Bernice's songs is the essence of struggle," says Judy Richardson introducing Dr. Bernice Johnson Reagon. And Reagon declares that "I am standing on ground plowed by people before I came into being." She describes her deep involvement with the freedom struggle in Albany, Georgia. A noted scholar of Black music, she says that the spirituals, often thought of as old people's music, "leaped into service in jail cells in the 1960s." The cultural history of Black people has always reflected what Black people expect from life on earth. Her presentation in song and spoken word outlines the history expressed by Black spiritual music and how it connects to contemporary struggle. "You will not be able to get through your life if you dismiss the ground you're standing on." 79 min. <b>DVD X5505</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>Berkeley in the Sixties</b>.</dt>
<dd>A film by Mark Kitechell. Contents: Pt. 1 Confronting the university: the Free Speech Movement-- pt. 2. Confronting America: the anti-war movement (32 min.) -- pt. 3. Confronting history: the counter-culture movement(45 min.). Through interviews with participants and archival footage, presents a history of Berkeley, California in the 1960s. This film is a celebration and tribute to the spirited rebellion of the students of Berkeley in the 1960s. It romanticizes the past in some ways, but the participants, many of them just as dedicated to causes as they were as youths at Berkeley offer realistic and honest remembrances from those hectic days. The film is in three distinct segments: Part I -- Confronting the University. The demonstrations began simply with students protesting the appearance of the House Un-American Activities Committee on campus to investigate communist appearances as speakers. It was the beginning of Speaker Ban. It tells of the creation of the student activist group known as SLATE, and the increasing confrontations with the University administration then led by W. Clark Kerr. 41 minutes. Part II -- Confronting America. Largely about the efforts to carry their activism beyond the campus and the narrow environment of Berkeley and Oakland. The issues of Civil Rights and Free Speech soon give way to protest against the war in a place called Vietnam. 31 minutes. <b>Part III -- Confronting History.</b> The emergence of the counter-culture in neighboring San Francisco, and the politicization of blacks as represented by Stokeley Carmichael and more especially the activities of Huey Newton and Bobby Seale and the Black Panthers creates a new environment for many of the people in this movement. Suddenly differences in perspective and scope of activism change. 44 minutes. Notes: Edited by Veronica Selves. Photographed by Stephen Lighthill. Narrated by Susan Griffin.

<dt><b>Growing up in America.</b></dt>
<dd>Featuring: Allen Ginsberg, Jerry Rubin, Abbie Hoffman, Fred Hampton, Deborah Johnson, Fred Hampton, Jr., William Kunstler, John Sinclair, Don Cox, Timothy Leary. In 1969 Morley Markson made a film that captured the heart and soul of the 1960's and called it Breathing Together: Revolution of the Electric Family. Eighteen years later, Markson tracked down the living legends included in his film to see how their perspective of the Sixties may have changed. Asked to look at the footage of their younger selves, they reflect on how much their lives and the times have changed in 3 decades. 1988. 90 min. <b>Video/C 4972</b><br></dd>
<dt><b>[Hampton, Fred] The Murder of Fred Hampton</b></dt>
<dd>Mike Gray started out to make a film about the Black Panther Party, but on Dec. 4, 1969, the Chicago police raided a Panther apartment and his film became a documentary about the murder of Fred Hampton, chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party. The film footage of the raid directly contradicted the State Attorney's version of the raid and so filmmakers and Panthers came together to prove that Hampton had been the designated target of the violent, punitive raid. The film's inquiry pursues official spokesmen and traps them in their attempts at covering up an orchestrated assassination. Originally produced in 1971. 88 min. <b>DVD 7490; vhs Video/C 7577</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>The Murder of Fred Hampton</b></dt>
<dd>Mike Gray started out to make a film about the Black Panther Party, but on Dec. 4, 1969, the Chicago police raided a Panther apartment and his film became a documentary about the murder of Fred Hampton, chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party. The film footage of the raid directly contradicted the State Attorney's version of the raid and so filmmakers and Panthers came together to prove that Hampton had been the designated target of the violent, punitive raid. The film's inquiry pursues official spokesmen and traps them in their attempts at covering up an orchestrated assassination.

<dt><b>Two Towns of Jasper</b></dt>
<dd>In 1998 in Jasper, Texas, James Byrd, Jr., a black man, was chained to a pickup truck and dragged to his death by three white men. The town was forever altered, and the nation woke up to the horror of a modern-day lynching. The filmmakers set out to document the aftermath of the murder by following the trials of the local men charged with the crime. The result is an explicit and troubling portrait of race in America, one that asks how and why a crime like this could have occurred.
