<dd>Charles Bukowski didn't like to do live poetry readings. He was very blunt about this but audiences thought he was joking. He did readings for the money. By 1980, his book royalties, advances for film rights, and other income provided him with the means to be able to stop doing readings. His performances were legendary; cultivating anarchy, he'd goad the audience to mutiny, and usually challenge somebody--or anybody--to fight. Only a few of his readings were filmed. This performance on turned out to be the very last poetry reading Bukowski ever gave, even though he lived and wrote for another 14 years.
