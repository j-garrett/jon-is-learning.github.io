<dt><b>Alexander the Great (O Megalexandros)</b> (Greece | Italy | West Germany, 1991)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Theodoros Angelopoulos. Cast: Omero Antonutti, Eva Kotamanidou, Mihalis Giannatos, Grigoris Evangelatos. Based on some historical events, the film gives a romanticized biography of Theodoros Kolokotronis (1770 &ndash; 1843), a Greek historical hero serving as a metaphor for Greece herself. Based on a circular view of history, the film presents conflicting ideologies - primitive communism, anarchism, chiefdom or kingdom, personality cult - and shows the institutions of property and power in a bad light. 199 min. <b>DVD X7188</b></dd>
