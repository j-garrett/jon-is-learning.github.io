A lump of dough rises like a ghost and dances over to a packet of yeast, which it mixes into water and drinks, then grows, a la Jekyll and Hyde.

The worm, for his part, sets off with a flute and jazzes along happily, outfinessing the bird repeatedly. Then a pair of shiftless crows debate the virtues of early rising and decide that no worm is worth it (clearly, these are shiftless "Negro" stereotypes, though the ethnic angle isn't stressed here so much). Finally, a rattlesnake practises some hypnotic moves on both bird and worm before getting tied up in knots."

<dd>Directed by Robert Clampett, Warner Brothers. "Falling Hare is a 1943 Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Robert Clampett, starring Bugs Bunny. The title is another play on "hair", as "falling hair" refers to impending baldness, while in this cartoon's climax, the title turns out to be descriptive of Bugs' situation. Within the cartoon are several contemporary pop culture references, including to Wendell Willkie, John Steinbeck's novel Of Mice and Men and the folk songs "Yankee Doodle", "I've Been Working on the Railroad", and the Russian folk song "Dark Eyes. In addition, the Gremlin's behavior is possibly a homage to Bob Clampett's version Daffy Duck (for example, he is seen in one scene riding an invisible bicycle, one of Daffy's old trademarks, among other acts.)" The Gremlin holds the distinction, along with Cecil Turtle,the unnamed mouse from "Rhapsody Rabbit" and the fly from Baton Bunny, of being one of the very few antagonists to actually outsmart and rattle Bugs."
