As Ghatak unfolds the tragic tale of a couple separated by a kidnapping, he also delivers a lyrical account of the speech, rhythms and rituals of a Malo fishing community ... a raw and powerful tale of a drying river and a dying culture. 159 min. <b>DVD 3781</b></dd>

<dd>Directed by Itthisoontorn Vichailak. Cast: Anuchit Saphanphong, Adul Dulyarat, Sumeth Ong-Ard, Phoovarit Phumpuang, Arratee Tanmahapran. Based on the life of Luang Pradit Pairoh (Sorn Silapabanleng) the most revered traditional Thai music master who lived during the reigns of Kings Rama V to VIII. The movie traces the life of Sorn, who picked up the ra-nad ek (Thai xylophone) mallets as a small child and played all his life. The backdrop to Sorn's life tale is the story of Thailand's classical music from its golden age during the reign of King Rama V to near extinction after the end of the absolute monarchy when the government banned it as uncivilised in the 1930s. The film shifts back and forth from the time when Sorn was a young man, playing in a xylophone duel with the intense Kun In, to the 1940s, when Thailand was under Japanese occupation and Sorn's playing would provide some inspiration to the oppressed citizenry of the time. 104 min. <b>DVD 5989</b></dd>

As their romances and rivalries deepen, the background of the Indian society, culture and environment influences all their personalities in subtle and symbolic ways. From The Movie Guide: "Jean Renoir's first film in color, THE RIVER is an extraordinarily rich and almost therapeutically heartening movie about an English family living in Bengal. Part coming-of-age story, part empathetic travelogue, part philosophic poem, THE RIVER was cited by Renoir as 'one film that corresponds almost exactly to my initial concept of it.' 99 min. <b>DVD 3837; VHS 999:2821</b></dd>
