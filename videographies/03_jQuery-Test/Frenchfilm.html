<dt><b>[Absinthe] The Four Earliest Known Absinthe-related Films</b></dt>
<dd>Presents four movies from the silent film era concerning the distilled, highly alcoholic spirit absinthe. Almost from the very outset motion picture producers found a lucerative niche producing films with an anti-alcohol message. The 1902 film "Les victimes de l'alcoolisme" was the first attempt by the newly formed Path&eacute; company to exploit the burgeoning demand for anti-absinthe and anti-alcohol propaganda. "Les Victimes de l'alcool" (1911), a far more sophisticated film, was enthusiastically promoted by the temperance movement and was a huge success for Path&eacute;. "Absinthe" (1913) is the only surviving U.S.-made absinthe related motion picture from the pre-ban era, featuring one of the very few filmed versions of absinthe being prepared and consumed. Contents: La Bonne absinthe / produced by Gaumont Film Company ; directed by Alice Guy (1899, 1 min.) -- Les Victimes de l'alcoolisme / produced by Path&eacute; ; directed by Ferdinand Zecca (1902, 4 min.) -- Les Victimes de l'alcool / produced by Path&eacute; ; directed by Gerard Bourgeois (1911, 26 min.) -- Absinthe / produced by the Gem Motion Picture Company ; starring Glen White and Sadie Weston (1913, 12 min.) <b>DVD X2294</b></dd>

<dd>Director, Claude Chabrol. Cast: Isabelle Huppert, Francois Cluzet, Marie Trintignant, Nils Tavernier. To survive Nazi-occupied 1940's France, Marie turns to illegally aborting pregnancies for a hefty fee. As her income increases, Marie moves her family to a posh apartment. Completely seduced by her lifestyle, Marie ignores her shell-shocked husband Paul. Things take a disastrous turn after one of Marie's "customers" dies and her husband turns her over to the authorities. Inspired by the real-life of Marie-Louise Girard, who was executed in 1943 by the Vichy Government, who'd declared abortion as a Crime Against the State because it diminished the number of potential soldiers. 108 min. <b>DVD 7256</b></dd>

<dd>Directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Two films made by Hitchcock during WW II at the request of the British government.

The first, <i>Bon Voyage</i>, is about an RAF pilot who has escaped from a POW camp and made his way back to London with the help of the French resistance. The second, <i>Aventure malgache</i>, is set in Vichy-controlled Madagascar where the Resistance leader battles to keep his island free. 58 min. <b>DVD 1031; vhs 999:990</b></dd>

<dt><b>Le Bal</b> (Italy | France | Algeria, 1983)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Ettore Scola. Cast: Christophe Allwright, Aziz Arbia, Marc Berman, Regis Bouquet, Chantal Capron, Liliane Delval, Martine Chauvin, Francesco De Rosa, Rossana Di Lorenzo, Etienne Guichard, Raymonde Heudeline, Arnault LeCarpentier, Olivie Loiseau, Nani Noel, Jean-Claude Penchenat, Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Perrier, Anita Picchiarini, Fran&ccedil;ois Pick, Genevieve Rey-Penchenat, Danielle Rochard, Monica Scattini, Michel Toty, Michel van Speybroeck. Le Bal takes place in a hypothetical Parisian dance hall and its plot is communicated entirely through mime, its pop music soundtrack and period ballroom dances. The prologue section, set in present time, introduces viewers to the cast of characters. The music begins and in a series of flashback sequences that use key moments in modern French history as their backdrop, viewers are presented with a clever yet poignant social commentary of prewar, postwar and modern times. 107 min. <b>DVD X4394</b></dd>

<dt><b>Bande &agrave; part (Band of Outsiders)</b> (1964)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Jean-Luc Godard. Cast: Anna Karina, Claude Brasseur, Sami Frey. Loneliness and desperation of French urban life are major themes in this film about three young Parisians who rob a suburban house only to find that their carefree caper has tragic consequences. "This Godard film is like a reverie of a gangster movie--a gangster movie as students in an espresso bar might remember it or plan it. It has the gangster-film virtues (loyalty, daring) but they are mixed with innocence, amorality, lack of equilibrium. It's as if a French poet took a banal American crime novel and told it to us in terms of the romance and beauty he read between the lines."

<dd>Directed by Jacques Rivette. Cast: Juliet Berto, Dominique Labourier, Marie-France Pisier, Philippe Cl&eacute;venot, Barbet Schroeder. "A brilliantly allusive meditation on the nature of fantasy, this is regarded by many as Jacques Rivette's most accomplished film. Two girls meet and wind up sharing each others' lives -- same flat, same fiance, same clothes -- even the same imagination. The film spins a circular, tortuous fantasy around their lives while at the same time acting as a meditation on the art of cinema itself."

<dt><b>Deux ou trois choses que je sais d'elle (Two or Three Things I Know About Her)</b> (1966)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Jean-Luc Godard.

The "her" in the film refers to Paris. Inspired by a real article on housewife prostitution, the film examines Godard's theory that if you lived in Paris (at the time) one had to prostitute oneself to survive. This "sociological fable" is shot through the eyes of Juliette, a housewife who spends one day a week in central Paris selling her body on the street in the hope that she will be able to escape the high rise suburban drudgery in which she lives with her family, and find happiness. Disc set includes book (50 p.) on making of the film. 84 min. <b>DVD 8461; vhs 999:1761</b></dd>

The convoluted plot involves a group of Victorian Englishmen who get so enmeshed in lies and disguises, murders and supposed murders, intrigues and romances, that Scotland Yard and the participants themselves are confused. 109 min. <b>DVD 4793</b></dd>

<dd>Directed by Laurent Cantet. Cast: Aur&eacute;lien Recoing, Karin Viard, Serge Livrozet. Tells the story of Vincent, a middle-class family man recently fired from his drab, middle-management job. Unable to tell his family about his firing, Vincent spends his workdays driving around the French countryside - "business trips" he tells his wife - keeping intact the reassuring routine of going to work and coming home to his wife and kids. As his family grows suspicious of his evasive behavior, Vincent is forced to spin a new tale, pretending to get a job working for the U.N. In a bid to keep the money coming in, he recruits old friends to invest in an imaginary emerging-markets investment scheme. Vincent also falls in with Jean-Michel, a black market dealer whose ignominious past serves as an ominous warning for Vincent's present course. Despite his efforts to maintain an undisturbed surface, Vincent's wife begins to suspect something amiss. 128 min. <b>DVD X4383</b></dd>

<dd>Directed by Laurent Cantet. Cast: Fran&ccedil;ois B&eacute;gaudeau, Nassim Amrabt, Laura Baquela, Juliette Demaille, Cherif Bouna&iuml;dja Rachedi. Fran&ccedil;ois and his fellow teachers prepare for a new year at a high school in a tough neighborhood. Armed with the best intentions, they brace themselves to not let discouragement stop them from trying to give the best education to their students. Cultures and attitudes often clash in the classroom, a microcosm of contemporary France. As amusing and inspiring as the teenaged students can be, their difficult behavior can still jeopardize any teacher's enthusiasm for the low-paying job. Fran&ccedil;ois insists on an atmosphere of respect and diligence. Neither stuffy nor severe, his extravagant frankness often takes the students by surprise. But his classroom ethics are put to the test when his students begin to challenge his methods. Inspired by the novel Entre les murs by Fran&ccedil;ois B&eacute;gaudeau. 130 min. <b>DVD X1877</b></dd>

<dd>Directed by Chantal Akerman. Filmmaker Akerman makes a voyage from East Germany, across Poland and the Baltics, to Moscow, shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Bloc.

<dt><b>&Eacute;tat de si&egrave;ge (State of Siege)</b> (France / West Germany / Italy, 1973)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Costa Gavras. Cast: Yves Montand, Renato Salvatori, O. E. Hasse. A drama based on the true story of the interrogation and execution of CIA agent Dan Mitrione by urban guerillas, the Tupamoros of Uruguay. Kidnapped by the revolutionaries, Mitrone who had been training the country's police in sophisticated counter-insurgency and torture techniques, was held hostage in exchange for the release of political prisoners. Shot in Chile with the approval of President Allende shortly before his assassination, the film was the first to detail the uglier side of the kind of paramilitary training that the U.S. has often performed for its allies.

<dt><b>France Tour Detour Deux Enfants</b> (1978)</dt>
<dd>In this intimately scaled study of the effect of television on a French family, Jean Luc Godard and Anne Marie-Mieville interview two children in contemporary France. Interviews, collages of television, cinema and advertising images are intercult with commentary by two adult television journalists. As they expose how a child's world is "programmed" by the institutions of family, school and television, Godard and Mieville posit the mass media as the pervasive cultural influence in the home, with television as the 20th century primer. Loosely inspired by G. Bruno's work: Le tour de la France par deux enfants. Originally produced in 1978. 54 min. each movement</dd>

<dd>Directed by Jean Luc Godard. Cast: Jean-Pierre Leaud, Juliet Berto. How do we learn? What do we know? Night after night, not long before dawn, Patricia and Emile meet on a sound stage to discuss learning, discourse, and the pathe to revolution. Scenes of the May '68 student revolts, the Vietnam war, posters, photographs, and cartoons form the backdrops to their words, which themselves are often their subject, as are images, sounds and juxtapositions. Based loosely on Jean Jacques Rousseau's incendiary treatise, "Emile, or on education", Godard's "Le gai savoir" is a montage, a meditation, a reflection on ideas - and how filmmaking is a path. 96 min. <b>DVD X3395; vhs 999:1104</b></dd>

<dd>â€¢149;<b>Disc 2:</b> This collection looks at pioneering French filmmakers from the Gaumont studio, with extensive examples of their work. Best remembered today for his espionage serials Les Vampires and Fant&ocirc;mas, Louis Feuillade had a more varied and profound influence upon French cinema than many of his followers realize. For more than a decade, he was the artistic director at Gaumont, encouraging the rise of such filmmakers as Abel Gance and L&eacute;once Perret. This collection of films offers a wider view of Feuillade's directorial efforts -- but, admittedly, it is only a small portion of the nearly 800 films he is believed to have directed.</dd>

<dd>â€¢149;<b>Disc 3:</b> This collection looks at pioneering French filmmakers from the Gaumont studio, with extensive examples of their work. Until now, the films of L&eacute;once Perret have been virtually unseen in the United States, yet he was a hugely influential figure in the growth of the French film industry. As an actor, he appeared in more than 100 films from 1909 to 1916, including the long-running series of "L&eacute;once" comedies. But his greater contribution was as a director who set the standard to which other French filmmakers aspired. His films had a technical mastery and aesthetic grace that allowed them to reveal subtleties of character and meaning.</dd>

<dd>Directed by Abdellatif Kechiche. Cast: Habib Boufares, Hafsia Herzi, Faridah Benkhetache.. "At the port of S&egrave;te, Mr. Slimani, a tired 60-year-old, drags himself toward a shipyard job that has become more and more difficult to cope with as the years go by. He is a divorced father who forces himself to stay close to his family despite the schisms and tensions that are easily sparked off and that financial difficulties make even more intense. He is going through a delicate period in his life and, recently, everything seems to make him feel useless: a failure. He wants to escape from it all and set up his own restaurant. However, it appears to be an unreachable dream given his meager, irregular salary that is not anywhere near enough to supply what he needs to realize his ambition. But he can still dream and talk about it with his family in particular. A family that gradually gives its support to this project, which comes to symbolize the means to a better life. Thanks to its ingeniousness and hard work, this dream soon becomes a reality...or almost." [IMDB] 180 min. <b>DVD X4185</b></dd>

<dt><b>Ici et ailleurs (Here and Elsewhere).</b></dt>
<dd>Directed by Jean-Luc Godard. Initially begun as a documentary portraying a sympathetic view of Palestinian revolutionaries, this film was ultimately transformed into a filmed essay addressing the relationship between politics and image and the problems of documentary filmmaking. After the filmmakers returned to France, a massacre by Hussein's troops killed most of the film subjects. At this point Godard joined the production and produced a film presenting the parallel lives of two families -- one French, one Palestinian -- with the film questioning the images and suggesting that documentaries present a false, constructed vision of reality. 1970. 55 min. <b>Video/C 6879</b></dd>

<dt><b>J'Accuse</b> (1937)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Abel Gance. <i>J'Accuse</i> was first released in 1919 as a silent film, but during the late thirties, appalled at the prospect of a second World War, Gance retold his story in a vastly different version to challenge the awful onslaught of history. Jean Diaz is a research scientist who survived the carnage of WWI and swears to dedicate his life to ending war, a burden which drives him to madness. When he discovers his work is being exploited by the military-industrial establishment, he summons up the millions of dead soldiers from World War I to rise from their graves, to bring the world to its senses. Gance's monumental work anticipated the terrible destructive capability of modern weapons and remains a powerful statement for today.</dd>
</dl>
<p>J'accuse is a World War I drama considered to be one of the most technically advanced films of the era and the first major pacifist film. It was referred to by Gance as "a human cry against the bellicose din of armies." Stars Marise Dauvray as Edith, a young woman who is unhappily married to an older man Fran&ccedil;ois, but is actually in love with a young poet Jean Diaz. Both Jean and Fran&ccedil;ois end up on the front lines of World War I while Edith is captured by German forces and suffers atrocities at the hands of the soldiers. Gance contrasts individual human suffering with the larger horrors of was, depicted with stark realism. Paris pendant la guerre (Paris during the war): A rare comical look at Parisian life during wartime. These short vignettes feature several popular performers of the day (including: F&eacute;lix Galipaux, M. Rablet, Marcel Simon, M.

The few surviving humans begin researching time travel, in hopes of sending someone back to the pre-war world in search of food, supplies, and hopefully some sort of solution to mankind's imminent demise. The protagonist is a man whose retention of a single, vague childhood memory (that of witnessing a murder on the jetty at Orly airport) is the basis for his being chosen to travel back in time. His journey leads him towards an enigmatic and paradoxical destiny. This fascinating story is told primarily with still photographs; the film contains only one moving image."

<dt><b>Letter to Jane</b> (France, 1972)</dt>
<dd>Directors, Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Pierre Gorin. "This extraordinary little movie emerges from the then recently formed French Dziga Vertov film collective, led by Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Pierre Gorin. The collective produced a number of provocative films that show a distinct move away from the more 'middle class' narratives of a film like Pierrot le fou (Godard, 1965). In Letter to Jane, a single news photograph (see further discussion below) first appears on the screen: it is of Jane Fonda towering above some Vietnamese, and on the sound track Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Pierre Gorin discuss the implications of the photograph. Their talk is didactic, and reveals what Laura Mulvey referred to later as Godard's "always interesting" misogyny (quoted in Williams 1992: 84). Certainly the intensity of a film consisting of a still picture and two ideologues berating the subject of the picture has something of the feeling of a show trial about it. The Marxist/Maoist Dziga Vertov movement and Jane Fonda's own short career as a bourgeois idealist collide in what in retrospect is a film by two rather privileged intellectuals who both seem to lack a sense of history's ironies." [Dawson, J. 2002.] Includes 1972 video interview excerpt with Jean-Luc Godard; new video interview with Jean-Pierre Gorin; includes a booklet including essays by film critics J. Hoberman and Kent Jones and Godard biographer Colin MacCabe and an excerpted interview with Gorin and Godard from 1972. 52 min. <b>DVD 3549</b> (supplement to DVD of <i>Tout va bien</i>)</dd>

<dd>Directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud. Cast: Jean Carmet, Jacques Dufilho, Catherine Rouvel, Jacques Spiesser, Dora Doll. The idyllic life in a French-African settlement is rudely interrupted in 1915 by news of war in Europe. The French gamely assemble a rag-tag army of native soldiers to try to capture a neighboring German settlement. The result is a classic farce whose comedy is enlivened by the antic clash of African versus European customs. 88 min. <b>DVD 1667; vhs 999:333</b></dd>

Part poetry, part journalism, part philosophy, Notre Musique is master filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard's witty and lyrical reflection on war through the ages. The film is structured into three Dantean Kingdoms: Hell, Purgatory and Heaven. The journey begins in Hell, represented by modern war and then moves to Purgatory, set in Sarajevo. Finally, Paradise is conceived as a small beach guarded by Marines from the United States. At the same time, the film also follows the parallel stories of two Israeli Jewish women, one drawn to the light and one drawn towards darkness. 80 min. <b>DVD 4029</b></dd>

One morning, a small French city wakes up to discover thousands of recently dead people walking into town. The reason why is a mystery and there is no time to look into it. Hasty reunions--some passionate, some strained-- occur with their survivors. But can they be reintegrated into society when their jobs have been filled and their partners have moved on? As officials try to figure out that to do with them, the dead begin behaving in bizarre ways and it becomes apparent that the returnees are not exactly who they used to be. 103 min. <b>DVD 8272</b></dd>

Cast: Josephine Baker, Helene Hallier, Andre Luguet, Pepa Bonafe, Gretchikine, Madame Komakova, Ludovic, Lila Nikolska, Skibinne, Tiller's Follies Girls, Ruth Zackey and the Hoffmann Girls. Helene Hallier, an ambitious by innocent would-be young chorine, trumps a music hall publicity stunt to become the new Parisian nightclub sensation. The light story is only a pretext for La Revue des Revues' white-hot, non-stop procession of outrageously and scantily attired exotic dancers, showgirls, and acrobats including the Tiller's Follies Girls, Ruth Zackey and the Hoffman Girls, and danseuse russe Lila Nikolska. But it's Josephine Baker, "the high priestess of primitivism" who triumphs in two show stopping numbers. 103 min. <b>DVD 9107</b></dd>

<dt><b>Rififi</b> (1955)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Jules Dassin. Cast: Jean Servais, Carl Mohner, Robert Manuel, Perlo Vita (i.e. Jules Dassin). A suspenseful story of a successful jewel robbery engineered by an aging ex-con in which the four thieves betray each other. The film ends in an orgy of torture, murder, kidnapping and retribution. One of the greatest crime capers, it set the standard for all others that followed. Most notable is Dassin's exquisitely intense silent burglary sequence which runs nearly half an hour. 117 min. <b>DVD 3903; vhs 999:2779</b></dd>

He's lost the dressmaker's address and his boss is gone for five days, so he stays in the Moskova neighborhood of the 18th arrondissement with Mok. Mok makes rap music of Jean de La Fontaine's fables, invents fabrications of his own, is in debt to his bookie, and in love with a punk rocker.

Once Alilo gets the dresses, he must return to Algiers, but it seems he's only started to live: is there any way he can stay? 98 min. <b>DVD X4758; vhs 999:3096</b></dd>

<dd>Directed by Catherine Breillat. Cast: Anne Parillaud, Gregoire Colin, Roxane Mesquida, Ashley Wanninger, Dominique Colladant, Bart Binnema, Yves Osmu, Francis Seleck, Elisabete Piecho. For director Jeanne, sex is no laughing matter. She doesn't find it funny that her two leading actors can't stand each other when she's about to shoot the most important moment in her film ... the sex scene. The actress objects to nudity, the actor won't take off his socks, and the only thing heating up between them is their tempers. At her wits' end, Jeanne tries everything in her power to seduce, intimidate and sweet-talk her reluctant young lovers into performing the film's sexy final scene. 95 min. <b>DVD 3840</b></dd>

<dt><b>Les silences du palais (Saimt el qusur; The Silences of the Palace)</b> (Tunisia / France, 1994)</dt>
<dd>Director, Moufida Tlatli. As Alia, the daughter of a beautiful servant, Khedija, grows up in the king's palace at the end of the French colonial rule in Tunisia, she realizes the sexual favours required of her mother and other servants, as she, herself, is misused by those in power around her. Women had to live in silence, a silence so profound, they may come to doubt their own past -- even their own existence -- yet they survived these political realities with courage, comradeship, and the resources of their bodies. 127 min. <b>vhs 999:3204</b></dd>

In nearly every case, Tina never gets to finish a sentence.

<dt><b>Taris, champion de natation (Taris, roi de l'eau)</b> (1931)</dt>
<dd>"The second of Vigo's four films is about 10 minutes long. The subject, allegedly, is a French national swimming champion, Jean Taris. First we see him swimming normally. Then we see a hint that this isn't a documentary short: Taris dives into the water, Vigo runs the film backwards, and Taris is spit back out. This happens 3 times. Thus the crux of the film: inventive (for the time) technique, while overuse of it occurs. Fun stuff, though: interesting shots of Taris doing the backstroke. Finally, we see him goofing around underwater; by this point, the movie achieves a genuine state of grace. Can be found on No. 10 of the New York Film Annex's video series of experimental and abstract films." [Internet Movie Database] <b>DVD 3482</b></dd>

<dd>Directed by Raoul Ruiz. Cast: Catherine Deneuve, Emmanuelle Beart, Vincent Perez, John Malkovich, Marcello Mazzarella. Set in 1922, this film opens with the French author, Marcel Proust, on his deathbed remembering his life. Gradually his own experiences give way to the characters in his novels -- fiction eclipses reality as the author's creations combine with his own experiences. The result is a montage of moving snapshots and feverish dreams that make the film the ultimate in Proustian cinema. 158 min. <b>DVD 632</b></dd>

After the war he uses it to start a utopian society by brainwashing his friends, including his former fiancee, Livia, and her husband. In the present day, the castle is being used as an alternative school and, in the summer holidays, for an educational conference. At the conference, the American Nora Winkle bets Claudine that the ernest public school teacher Elisabeth Rousseau will be enticed into the bed of Robert Dufresne, even though the principal speaker, Walter Guarini, is obviously interested in Elisabeth. Meanwhile, the children staying at the castle over the holidays invent their own medieval tale about freeing prisoners from the dungeons. Special features: Original theatrical trailer; 1983 "making of" documentary: "Resnais et un roman" (Resnais is a bed of roses). 110 min. <b>DVD 9398</b></dd>

<dt><b>Une Affaire de femmes (Story of women)</b> (1988)</dt>
<dd>Director, Claude Chabrol. Cast: Isabelle Huppert, Francois Cluzet, Marie Trintignant, Nils Tavernier. To survive Nazi-occupied 1940's France, Marie turns to illegally aborting pregnancies for a hefty fee. As her income increases, Marie moves her family to a posh apartment. Completely seduced by her lifestyle, Marie ignores her shell-shocked husband Paul. Things take a disastrous turn after one of Marie's "customers" dies and her husband turns her over to the authorities. Inspired by the real-life of Marie-Louise Girard, who was executed in 1943 by the Vichy Government, who'd declared abortion as a Crime Against the State because it diminished the number of potential soldiers. 108 min. <b>DVD 7256</b></dd>

<dd>Directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot. Cast: Pierre Fresnay, Ginette Leclerc, Micheline Francey, Helena Manson, Jeanne Frusier-Gir, Sylvie, Liliane Maigne, Pierre Larquey, Noel Roquevert. A mysterious writer of poison pen letters, known only as Le Corbeau, plagues a French provincial town, unwittingly exposing the collective suspicion and rancor seething beneath the community's calm surface. Brilliantly captures the spirit of paranoid pettiness and self-loathing turning an occupied French town into a twentieth-century Salem style witch-hunt. Made during the Nazi occupation of France, the film was attacked from all sides and banned after the Liberation. 91 min. <b>DVD 3276; vhs 999:1650</b></dd>
