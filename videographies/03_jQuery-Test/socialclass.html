<dt><b>Alice Adams</b> (1935)</dt>
<dd>Directed by George Stevens. Cast: Katharine Hepburn, Fred MacMurray, Fred Stone, Evelyn Venable, Hattie McDaniel. Social climber Alice tries to push her clodhopper family to the background and assumes airs to win the love of an amiable, wealthy young man. In this tender comedy of Americana and manners each must overcome the obstacles of their backgrounds for their love to flourish.<br>
"The highlight of the film is the classic, tragically funny, disastrous dinner-party scene. The aspiring, pretentious Alice hopelessly wishes to rise up above the low-social prominence of her vulgar, poor family. To impress Arthur, her rich new suitor, she has planned a "stylish" dinner party at her own home - in the wilting humidity and heat - she fiercely wishes to make a good impression by having conned Arthur into believing that her folks are well-to-do. She has fictionalized her life to him and forced everyone in her family to pretend that they are something other than themselves."

<dd>Directed by William Dieterle. Cast: Ruth Chatterton, George Brent. Drama about a self- centered, materialistic woman whose stockbroker husband (Brent) loses his fortune. "Pre-Hays Code films continue to surprise and delight with their mature and downright honest depiction of relationships. The treatment of the frailty and shortcomings of married partners (admittedly the stinking rich where infidelity can be explored at one remove and is par for the course) and their romantic entanglements is refreshingly frank. Affairs are tolerated and freely admitted to and the erring partners are not unduly punished but do go through a redemption nevertheless."

"Bobby Eroica Dupea (Jack Nicholson) comes from a well-bred family of musicians, and once showed great promise as a concert pianist. By nature a restless, angry individual, Bobby left his family and his music when he could no longer endure the dull, cloistered routine of daily practice. He took to the road, wanting to "see the world," and hopefully find something or someone to quell his inner turmoil. He has settled in a small town as an oil rigger, where his life consists of going to work, arguing with his dimwitted but loving girlfriend Rayette (Karen Black), and bowling every night with his friend Elton (Billy "Green" Bush). Not surprisingly, this routine begins to disgust Bobby and, fed up, he decides to travel to Puget Sound, Washington to pay his family a visit. Leaving Rayette at a nearby motel, Bobby goes home and is reunited with his family."

Handsome David Page is loved by two very different women: Molly, an overpainted and undereducated floozy, and Florence, a refined graduate of a finishing school. Since both lovelorn ladies are played by Norma Shearer, melodrama fans know they're in for double the romantic heartache. Shearer was on the cusp of stardom when she took these showy dual roles. She makes both women strong characters, but it's her Molly who stands out: blowzy, crude, aching with love and longing for class. 64 min. <b>DVD X5548</b></dd>

<dt><b>Miss Lulu Bett</b> (1921)</dt>
<dd>Directed by William C. de Mille. Cast Lois Wilson, Theodore Roberts, Helen Ferguson, Mabel Van Buren. "Lulu Bett and her mother live with her sister, Ina, and brother-in-law, Dwight, and their two daughters - Diana, an older teenager, and a younger daughter, Monona, the typical pesky adolescent. Lulu is the housekeeper, cook and all-around "drudge" for the household and, although a relative, is treated with no more compassion than hired help and possibly with more disdain. Her domineering brother-in-law apparently takes great pleasure in cruel teasing, even his own children. His teasing toward Lulu is a constant reminder that she is not attractive and has no suitors. One day Dwight's world-traveling brother, Ninian, comes along after 20 years absence and falls for Lulu. Basically as an "I'll show you" reaction to her brother-in-law's teasing, she agrees to Ninian's marriage proposal. Later, however, he reveals that his wife left him 15 years ago, and he is not sure if she is alive or not. Lulu decides to go back home rather than risk living with a bigamist. This only intensifies the difficult situation at home as she has now embarrassed the family, a fact Dwight wants to keep quiet. The handsome schoolteacher, Neil Cornish, begins to show an interest in her, but Dwight does not approve - after all, Lulu may still be married. Lulu tells Neil about her marriage and the dilemma of not knowing if she's legally married or not. This does not dissuade him, and he continues to see Lulu. Diana is just as dissatisfied with the home as Lulu and decides to elope with Bobby Larkin. When Lulu learns of this, she goes to the train station and convinces Diana to come home. She promises not to tell Diwght and Ina. At home Diana has gone to her room, when Dwight and Ina come in and see Lulu wearing her hat and holding Diana's suitcase. They immediately assume she is running away with Neil and begin to berate her for trying to further disgrace the family. Dwight orders her to leave. Lulu's life seems to be crashing down all around her - she doesn't know if she's legally married or not, she can't return Neil's love for her, and she has no home or means of income."

<dt><b>Mrs. Miniver</b> (1942)</dt>
<dd>Directed by William Wyler. Cast: Greer Garson, Walter Pidgeon, Teresa Wright, Dame May Whitty, Reginald Owen, Henry Travers, Richard Ney, Henry Wilcoxon. "Although not as 'socially privileged' as in the book, the Mrs. Kay Miniver (Greer Garson) of the film version is still presented as living a comfortable life at a house called 'Starlings' in a village outside London. The house has a large garden, with a private landing stage on the river Thames, and a motorboat. Her husband Clem (Canadian born actor Walter Pidgeon) (despite his North American accent) is a successful English architect. They have three children: the youngsters Toby and Judy (Christopher Severn and Clare Sandars), and an older son Vin (Richard Ney) who is at university. They have live-in staff: Gladys the housemaid (Brenda Forbes) and Ada the cook (Marie De Becker). As World War II looms, Vin comes down from university and meets Carol Beldon (Teresa Wright), granddaughter of aristocratic Lady Beldon (Dame May Whitty) from nearby Beldon Hall. Despite initial disagreements, for example the contrast of Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences and Carol's practical altruism, they fall in love: Vin proposes to Carol at dinner time after young brother Toby has embarrassingly blurted out that he should do so if they are in love. They eventually marry. As the war comes closer to home, Vin feels he must do his bit, joins the Royal Air Force as a pilot, and when qualified is posted to a base near to his parents' home. Clem takes his motorboat to assist in the Dunkirk evacuation.[2] There are scenes of the family during an air-raid, when Mr. Foley (Reginald Owen), the storekeeper and air-raid warden, advises them to close their curtains; and they are shown in their shelter in the garden. Left alone at home, Kay finds a wounded German pilot (Helmut Dantine) in her garden. She feeds him, then calmly disarms him and calls the police. After the flower show's competition, in which the entry of the stationmaster (Henry Travers) named the 'Mrs. Miniver' rose is judged the winner over Lady Beldon's rose, Kay, with Carol, drives Vin to join his squadron just as an air attack begins.

After graduating from college, he shocks his father by telling that he has enlisted in the Navy and will enter training as a naval aviator.

He does however meet Paula, an attractive young woman who often attends base functions in the hope of nabbing a young officer and Sid Worley, a classmate with whom he forms a close bond.

<dt><b>Peyton Place</b> (1957)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Mark Robson. Cast: Lana Turner, Lee Philips, Lloyd Nolan, Arthur Kennedy, Russ Tamblyn. "The film is an expos&eacute; of the lives and loves of the residents of a small New England mill town, where scandal, homicide, suicide, incest, and moral hypocrisy hide behind a tranquil facade in the years immediately preceding and following World War II. At the core of its plot are three women. Constance MacKenzie is a prim and proper sexually repressed woman who had an affair with a married New York City businessman and bore him a child out of wedlock. She has struggled to shield her daughter Allison, a high school senior and aspiring author, from her tarnished past, leading her to believe she returned to Peyton Place with her newborn baby after her husband died. Selena Cross, Allison's best friend, is a good girl living on the wrong side of the tracks. She murders her stepfather Lucas after repeated sexual abuse, and her trial is the focus of the latter part of the film. Other characters include Allison's classmate and confidant Norman Page, a mama's boy anxious to gain his independence; bad girl Betty Anderson, who longs to have a relationship with wealthy Rodney Harrington; and new school principal Michael Rossi, who attempts to crack Constance's icy veneer."

<dt><b>Scar of Shame</b> (1927)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Frank Peregini. The Colored Players Film Co. produced films during the 1920's, the golden years of silent films. "The prime achievement of the Colored Players was this film, shot with a sure feeling for editing and composition the film compares with the best Hollywood product of its time. The film's story examines caste and class within the black community telling of a love affair between a music student of good social standing and the daughter of a working-class drunkard. "Made by Hollywood technicians, The Scar of Shame is nevertheless the product of black consciousness, examining as it does caste and class within the black community. The 'hero' is a light-skinned, refined music student of good social standing who, very much against his better judment, falls in love and marries the dark sensual daughter of a working-class drunkard. Expressing profound and probably unconscious reservations about the possibility of black success while limiting that success to that black who is like the white in values and appearance..." -- excerpt from AFI program notes by Stephen Zito.

This vintage film aims to examine this question during an era when many citizens of various races and social classes were still not extended complete civil rights.

It is a fascinating look at the history of socioeconomic determinism in the U.S. that tries to push the idea that social classes in America are determined before people are born, despite what we like to believe. 1957. 15 min.

<dd>Directed by Delmer Daves. Cast: Richard Egan, Dorothy McGuire, Sandra Dee, Arthur Kennedy, Troy Donahue. "The story examines the adult lives of two onetime teen lovers, Ken (Egan) and Sylvia (McGuire), who were from different social strata. Ken was self-supporting, working as a lifeguard at Pine Island, an exclusive Maine resort, while Sylvia's nouveau riche family stayed as guests of the owners, one summer between years at college. They went on to marry different people - entirely the wrong people, it turned out. Ken's wife Helen (Ford) turns out to be frigid and shuts him out romantically, while Sylvia's husband Bart (Kennedy) becomes an alcoholic, gradually costing him the family fortune. Ken buries himself in the research chemist's job he finds after college, while Sylvia devotes herself first to charity work, then motherhood. The saving grace of each marriage is their children, Sylvia's son Johnny (Donahue) and Ken's daughter Molly (Dee). Ken and Sylvia meet again on Pine Island after twenty years, with Ken now wealthy through his chemistry work, while Bart has turned his family's mansion (their sole remaining asset) into an inn, which is failing. Johnny and Molly meet and fall in love, while Ken and Sylvia begin to cheat with each other on their spouses." 130 min. <b>DVD 7552; vhs 999:1482</b></dd>
