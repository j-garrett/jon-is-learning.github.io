<dd>Director, Yamina Benguigui. Film about the "family reunion," the French government's euphemism for a 1974 law allowing Algerian wives to rejoin their husbands working in France. Strong-willed Zouina parts tearfully from her mother in the port of Algiers; once in France, she and her three small children are at the mercy of her mother-in-law and confused by the strange customs of their local grocer and garden-obsessed neighbor. The radio is her only window on life and on the women of this new country. 98 min. <b>DVD 1907</b></dd>

<dt><b>Salut cousin!</b> (France | Algeria | Belgium | Luxembourg, 2000)</dt>
<dd>Director, Merzak Allouache. Cast: Gad Elmaleh, Mess Hattou, Magaly Berdy, Ann-Gisel Glass. Alilo arrives in Paris, met by his hip cousin Mok. Alilo is to pick up a suitcase of dresses to smuggle back to Algiers for resale. He's lost the dressmaker's address and his boss is gone for five days, so he stays in the Moskova neighborhood of the 18th arrondissement with Mok. Mok makes rap music of Jean de La Fontaine's fables, invents fabrications of his own, is in debt to his bookie, and in love with a punk rocker. Alilo's old-country sweetness, in contrast with Mok's big-city neuroses, gets the attention of Fatoumata, a lovely African neighbor. Once Alilo gets the dresses, he must return to Algiers, but it seems he's only started to live: is there any way he can stay? 98 min. <b>DVD X4758; vhs 999:3096</b></dd>

<dt><b>Cairo Station (The Iron Gate) (Bab al-Hadid)</b> (1958)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Youssef Chahine. A smoldering tale of life among the poor who live in Cairo's railroad station. "Reportedly (and understandably) Youssef Chahine's most popular film among Egyptians, this gritty and relatively early (1958) black-and-white masterpiece also features his most impressive acting turn, as a crippled news vendor working at the title railroad station. The adroit interweaving of various miniplots around the station is matched by a heady mix of moods and genres: at various junctures this movie becomes a musical, a slasher film, a neorealist drama, a comedy, and a horror film--come to think of it, it's pretty noir as well."

<dt><b>The Cyclist (Bicycleran)</b> (Iran, 1989)</dt>
<dd>Writer, director, and editor, Muhsin Makhmalbaf. Nazim, formerly a cyclist, but now a lowly Afghan guest worker in Iran, must overcome many obstacles in his attempt to ride a bicycle continuously for seven days and nights, in order to obtain money to pay for medical care for his desperately ill wife. "Made between The Peddler and Marriage of the Blessed, this 1989 Iranian feature by the highly talented Mohsen Makhmalbaf, a filmmaker comparable in some ways to Martin Scorsese, follows the exploitation of an Afghan refugee who embarks on a bicycle marathon in order to raise money for his wife's medical expenses. A searing expressionist work about man's inhumanity, filmed in a hypnotic and feverish style. With Moharram Zaynalzadeh and Esmail Soltanian."

When the family of the victim repeatedly fails to show up on the appointed day, Mansour's execution is postponed again and again. Stuck inside the purgatory of his own mind, he waits as time passes on without him, caught between life and death, retribution and forgiveness. 85 min. <b>DVD 6318</b></dd>

<dt><b>Five: 5 Long Takes Dedicated to Yasujiro Ozu</b> (Iran / Japan / France, 2003)</dt>
<dd>Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami pays homage to Yasujiro Ozu, the brilliant Japanese filmmaker whose spare but evocative style has been a major influence on Kiarostami's work. Canny and sublime, the film is comprised of five long, apparently single takes of a beach on the Caspian Sea, all focusing on the ocean, comprised of virtually no camera movement and enveloped in rapturous natural sound. Richly poetic and shot on a hand-held DV camera, the film features five extended, apparently single-take sequences. One: The camera accompanies a piece of wood with which the waves are toying at the beach. Two: People are walking along by the seaside. Older people stop, look at the waves, then walk away. Three: Indistinct shapes on a beach in winter. A group of dogs. A love story. Four: Ducks noisily cross the frame in one direction, then the other. Five: A pond; nighttime; frogs; a chorus of sounds, then a storm, and finally dawn. Special features: 2 films: Around five: Abbas Kiarostami's reflections on film and The making of Five. In Iranian with English subtitles. 74 min. DVD 8221</dd>

<dd>Directed by Mohsen Makhmalbaf. Based on true events, film director Makhmalbaf at age 17 while a member of an anti-Shah militant group, attacked a policeman in an attempt to steal his gun.

He stayed there until the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Twenty years later, the filmmaker placed an ad in the paper to recruit actors for Salaam Cinema. The same wounded officer responded to the ad giving both the assailant and victim a chance to tell their side of the story and in the process, exorcise the demons of their past. 75 min. <b>vhs 999:3083</b></dd>

According to Islamic custom, women are not permitted to watch or participate in men's sports. Many of the ambitious young female fans who manage to sneak into the arena are caught and sent to a holding pen, guarded by male soldiers their own age. Duty makes these young men and women adversaries, but duty can't overcome their shared dreams, their mutual attraction, and ultimately their overriding sense of national pride and humanity. 92 min. <b>DVD 8777</b></dd>

<dt><b>Once Upon a Time Cinema (Ruzi Ruzagari, Cinema)</b> (Iran, 1992)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Mohsen Makhmalbaf. A loving comedic homage to movies and moviemaking in Iran. It jumps around from the old silent days under the Shah to the current day, and makes fun of censorship rules. The leading character is known simply as "Cinematographer," and characters appear in multiple roles onscreen in re-created films from previous eras, as well as in the story itself. In some cases, the screen characters leave the movie they are in and interact with real-life people. This antic comedy also screens clips from well-know Iranian films of the past. 100 min. <b>vhs 999:2966</b></dd>

<dd>Directed by Manijeh Hekmat. Cast: Roya Nonahali, Roya Taymourian, Pegah Ahangarani, Golab Adineh, Maryam Boobani. Famously 'banned' for more than a year by Iranian authorities, this taboo-breaking film is based on Manijeh Hekmat's long fieldwork, among women prisoners in Iran. She depicts the lives of Iran's lost generation in the two decades since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, using the claustrophobic life of women behind bars as a metaphor for the entire society. Her protagonist, Mitra, is in prison for killing her violent stepfather. On the eve of a prison riot she confronts Tahereh, the new warden, whose dogmatic views she challenges fearlessly. Over the course of the next 20 years, Tahereh's attitude toward her prisoners changes and oftens, which reflects the country's shifting political stance. Eventually Mitra, aged and exhausted, is finally released, but Tahereh left behind, is now more like a prisoner herself. 106 min. <b>DVD 6866</b></dd>

<dt><b>[Aljafari, Kamal] The films of Kamal Aljafari</b></dt>
<dd>Contents: Port of memory (2009, 62 min.) -- The Roof (2006, 61 min.) -- Balconies (2009, 11 min.) -- Visit Iraq (2006, 26 min.). The haunting films of Kamal Aljafari mix documentary, fiction and personal memoir to render complex portraits of the Palestinian communities in Ramleh and Jaffa, now part of Israel. While providing a rare look at the everyday lives of Palestinian Israelis, the films are more than simply sociopolitical treatises of often-overlooked communities and neighborhoods in danger of dissolving. Aljafari instead astutely balances fiction and nonfiction to capture the fragile rhythms of lives lived in a kind of permanent displacement and the strange limbo of neighborhoods subtly yet inexorably transforming. <b>Port of Memory</b> : The history of the town of Jaffa, a thriving port city now part of Tel Aviv, provides the background for Aljafari's most recent film, centering on his mother's family at risk of eviction if they can't find proof that the house they have lived in for decades belongs to them. Their predicament is rendered with Aljafari's usual subtlety, as well as deadpan humor and dark wit. This skeletal narrative provides the scaffolding for a portrait of life in what was once a bustling neighborhood that was nearly emptied by fighting during the establishment of the state of Israel, and then suffered decades of official neglect. <b>The Roof</b> : This deceptively quiet film presents a portrait of Aljafari's family in Ramleh and Jaffa that hovers between documentary and cinematic memoir, guided by a nimble camera moving calmly but ceaselessly around the rooms of homes inhabited, damaged and ruined. The title refers to the roof missing from the house where Aljafari's family resettled in 1948, a home unfinished, an incomplete construction project. <b>Balconies</b> : An experimental meditation focusing on the deteriorating and unfinished balconies in Palestine. <b>Visit Iraq</b> : A humorous look at how Geneva residents imagine and project clich&eacute;s on the recently abandoned office of Iraqi Airlines. 159 min. <b>DVD X5823</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>Chronicle of a Disappearance</b> (Israel, 1996)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Elia Suleiman. Deceptively simple and executed with a documentary feel, this drama is a series of vignettes or tableaux, some "real life," some fantasy. It represents a highly personal journey home for ex-patriot Palestinian filmmaker Elia Suleiman. The film is divided into two sections. The first presents the sleepy existence in the Arab part of Nazareth, while the second takes a more political view of the city with disturbing images of Arab people trapped in a cultural identity crisis, exemplified by a young Arab woman who wants more independence. 88 min. <b>DVD 4297; vhs 999:3201</b></dd>

<dt><b>A History of Israeli Cinema</b></dt>
<dd>Weaves together clips from more than 70 years of Israeli film to give audiences a kaleidoscopic history of Israeli cinema, and by extension a history of the Jewish state. Part One spans 1933 to 1978, covering the early Zionist films that celebrated the struggle for nationhood. Part Two is devoted to 1978 to 2005, as filmmakers embrace the political and emotional reality of a country torn by ethnic and religious conflict. Includes interviews with noted film critics, actors and directors who talk about the role of cinema in a nation whose story is still being written. Commentary: Amos Gitai, Joseph Cedar, Yehuda Ne'eman, Moshe Ivgy, Zeev Revach, Avi Mograbi, Menachem Golan, Ronit Elkabetz. 2009. 208 min. <b>DVD X2595</b><br></dd>

A Richly compassionate chronicle of life in an Israeli occupied Arab village which is fiercely ruled by the Mukhtar, who fundamentally serves the interests of the Israeli military governor, instead of those of his own people. These are tough times for the villagers--some are bitter and spiteful--while others are weary of the power struggles. The narrative centers around such incidents as the military commander's discovery that one of the villagers is issuing work permits, and the killing of the Mukhtar's son. 104 min. <b>vhs 999:2312</b></dd>

<dt><b>The Silences of the Palace (Saimt el qusur; Les silences du palais)</b> (Tunisia / France, 1994)</dt>
<dd>Director, Moufida Tlatli. As Alia, the daughter of a beautiful servant, Khedija, grows up in the king's palace at the end of the French colonial rule in Tunisia, she realizes the sexual favours required of her mother and other servants, as she, herself, is misused by those in power around her. Women had to live in silence, a silence so profound, they may come to doubt their own past -- even their own existence -- yet they survived these political realities with courage, comradeship, and the resources of their bodies. 127 min. <b>vhs 999:3204</b></dd>

Eager to boost his business, Ali makes a television commercial and buys air time to make people aware of the superiority of his product; business is good until a pack of mischievous kids steals his motorbike while he's not looking. Ali has the wrong idea about who the culprit happens to be -- he is convinced one of his larger competitors has heisted the bike to keep his high-quality treats off the market. 105 min. <b>DVD X5896</b></dd>
