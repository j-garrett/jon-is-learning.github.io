<dt><b>Capturing Reality: The Art of Documentary (L'art du r&eacute;el: le cin&eacute;ma documentaire</b></dt>
<dd>Thirty-three documentarians offer reflections on making documentary films in this informative primer on the genre. The "superstars" include cinema verit&eacute; master Albert Maysles and Werner Herzog, Errol Morris, and Patricio Guzman. The issues confronted are such important ones as finding a topic, the effect the camera has on subjects and restaging sequences for one&rsquo;s film.

<dd>This program consists of a general introduction to film language and five "lessons" covering the major elements of cinematic language: (lighting, camera, mise en scene, editing, and sound).

The program is interactive allowing students to go directly from the introduction, to any of the five lessons, to supplementary information about the classic films or to the glossary of film terms used in the program. Scenes from: Carol Reed's "The Third Man" (Lighting), Buster Keaton's "The General" (Camera), Fritz Lang's "M" (Mise en scene), Sergei Eisenstein's "Alexander Nevsky" (Sound), and Alfred Hitchcock's "Sabotage" (Editing). 45 min. <b>DVD 8573</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>Hollywood Censored: Movies, Morality &amp; the Production Code</b> <i>(Culture Shock; 1)</i></dt>
<dd>First of a four part series exploring why particular works of art became controversial. Part one addresses the mass appeal of movies, including their portrayals of sex and violence which have made them a target of censors since the early days. In the 1930s, Hollywood studios enforced the Production Code, a set of guidelines for movie content, to answer growing charges of immorality. The Code lasted 20 years and still influences moviemaking today. As feature films continue to cause controversy, the question remains: do movies reflect--or cause--social behavior?

<dd>Dist.: Ѭ href="http://www.films.com">Films Media Group.Ж 2007.<br></dd>
<dd>â€¢149;<b>The Early Decades.</b> While the earliest motion pictures were admired simply for their novelty, viewers soon demanded more. This program describes the discovery of sex as a surefire cinematic attraction and the outrages it provoked among religious and civic authorities during Hollywood's formative years. Documenting the rise of William Hays as the arbiter of movie morality--and the studio system's answer, after the Fatty Arbuckle fiasco, to the threat of government censorship--the program explores the artistic and cultural shock waves created by Theda Bara, Rudolph Valentino, Erich Von Stroheim, Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, Jean Harlow, Busby Berkeley, Mae West, Barbara Stanwyck, and many other early film luminaries. 50 min. <b>DVD 8851</b><br></dd>
<dd>â€¢149;<b>From the Depression to WWII.</b> In what many see as Hollywood's Golden Age, the offices of William Hays and Joseph Breen worked overtime to combat sexuality and subversion in American movies. This program examines the products of that era--films that danced around the standards of the Production Code and paved the way for increasingly daring storytelling and images. From the modesty of It Happened One Night to the shocking and nearly prohibited use of "damn" in Gone with the Wind to the ambiguous morality of Double Indemnity, the program surveys the achievements of Clark Gable, Hedy Lamarr, Errol Flynn, Lana Turner, Rita Hayworth, Jane Russell, Cecil B. DeMille, Frank Capra, Billy Wilder, Preston Sturges, and other screen artists. The forces that led to Hays' dismissal and the weakening of the Code are discussed in depth. 72 min. <b>DVD 8852</b><br></dd>
<dd>â€¢149;<b>The 1950s and '60s.</b> After World War II, the wholesomeness of American movies faced a tidal wave of change--from outside, as a growing number of provocative foreign films made their way to the U.S., and from within, as car culture flowered and drive-in theaters sprang up across the country. This program documents the period, from the birth of art house cinema to the ascent of boundary-busting American actresses such as Ingrid Bergman, Brigitte Bardot, Sophia Loren, Marilyn Monroe and directors like Marlon Brando and Stanley Kubrick. Studying the shifting moral standards that Hollywood, Italian cinema, and the French New Wave signaled--and which the Catholic Legion of Decency resisted tooth and nail. The 1952 Supreme Court decision granting First Amendment protection to motion pictures is also highlighted. 59 min. <b>DVD 8853</b><br></dd>
<dd>â€¢149;<b>The Late 1960s to the '90s</b> In 1965, the Catholic Legion of Decency closed its doors; the following year, the Hays Code was scrapped. This program looks at the cinematic milestones which prompted these events and the age of freewheeling film artistry that ensued, despite attempts at censorship issuing from the highest political level. Shedding light on the release of The Pawnbroker and director Sidney Lumet's historic confrontation with the Legion, the program showcases the forging of the Motion Picture Association of America's rating system and the eventual association of the "X" classification with pornography. The impact of AIDS, the struggle against child pornography, and the creation of the NC-17 rating are also illuminated. 62 min. <b>DVD 8854</b><br></dd>

The Fatty Arbuckle case so shocked America that producers appointed Will Hays to clean up the industry before the public's moral outrage put them all out of work. Hays encouraged "human, heartwarming pictures" and issued a strictly enforced production code designed to keep films wholesome. Hollywood had found its savior. But his price was self-imposed censorship which would rule Hollywood for forty years. <b>Video/C 6156</b><br></dd>

Liz Mermin plunges into the world of the said production, and intercuts several real-life narratives involving the cast and crew, which include: the efforts of the tyro director to launch his first production; the narration of a real life ex-cop slapped with the moniker "Bombay's Dirty Harry," who details the rise of the Bollywood criminal underground for the audience; and the complicated life of Indian screen idol Sanjay Dutt, enmeshed in a criminal trial for allegedly participating in a massive and deadly terrorist attack.

<dt><b>Unwanted Cinema (Unerwunschtes Kino)</b></dt>
<dd>For many Jewish filmmakers, actors, actresses, writers, directors and other creative talents, the rise of Hitler and the Nazi party first threatened their livelihoods and soon their lives. In 1934 the exclusion of Jewish filmmakers in Germany led to independent productions in Budapest and Vienna, the so-called "Unwanted Cinema" banned by the Nazis. This documentary profiles a number of Jewish artists who contributed to independent films produced in Vienna and Budapest between 1934 and 1937. The film follows them in subsequent years, as they sought refuge from the Nazi terror, both in Europe and the U.S. The film focuses on Henry Koster, Ernst Verebes, Otto Wallburg, Felix Joachimson (Jackson), Hans Jaray, Franziska Gaal, Rosy Barsony, Hortense Raky, Oskar Pilzer, and Zoltan Vidor. Featuring scenes from many films of the period, Unwanted Cinema also recounts the efforts of Hollywood producer Joseph Pasternak, who offered many of these men and women their best chance of survival.

By comparing and contrasting clips from October and Strike; Man with a Movie Camera; and Berlin - Symphony of a Great City, she illustrates how Sergei Eisenstein, Dziga Vertov, and Walter Ruttmann employed montage to address the concept of the crowd as a heroic protagonist, the collective experience of going to the cinema, and other topics. Dr. Fer also juxtaposes the ideologies of Soviet Moscow and Weimar Berlin as presented in these films. Dist.: Ѭ href="http://www.films.com">Films Media Group.Ж c2005. 24 min. <b>DVD 4486</b><br></dd>

What started as a flickering curiousity in penny arcades soon grew into an art form. In just a few short years, Hollywood began turning out spectacular silent films, with original musical scores. In 1903, The Great Train Robbery drew wildly enthusiastic audiences. Twelve Years later D.W. Griffith produced The Birth of A Nation, which provoked riots and demonstrations, brought audiences flocking and gave birth to the financial fortunes of Hollywood. <b>DVD X1778 [preservation copy] Video/C 6154</b><br></dd>
<dd>â€¢149; <b>Hollywood. 2, In the Beginning</b> Contents: "Includes rare footage and excerpts from": The Squaw man (1914 -- Intolerance (1916) -- Joan the woman (1916) -- Silent heroes (1913) -- Robin Hood (1922) -- Flaming Youth (1923) -- Teddy at the throttle (1916) -- Thief of Bagdad (1924)<br>
In 1900, Hollywood was a peaceful village with sheep, goats and pigs wandering along its dusty streets. Then filmmakers arrived in search of permanent sunshine, and changed the town forever. The silent films produced by Hollywood transcended national boundaries and languages to become the most powerful medium of mass entertainment the world had ever known. <b>DVD X1779 [preservation copy] Video/C 6155</b><br></dd>
<dd>â€¢149; <b>Hollywood. 3, Single Beds and Double Standards</b> Contents: "Includes rare footage and excerpts from:" Coney Island (1917) -- The Ten Commandments (1923) -- A Woman of affairs (1928) -- Reformers (1913) -- Fatty and Mabel adrift (1916) -- Life of the party (1920) -- Isle of love (1918) -- Ella Cinders (1926)<br>
Hollywood had become a fairy-tale city of fabulous wealth and dizzying success, when a series of scandals shattered the dream. The Fatty Arbuckle case so shocked America that producers appointed Will Hays to clean up the industry before the public's moral outrage put them all out of work. Hays encouraged "human, heartwarming pictures" and issued a strictly enforced production code designed to keep films wholesome. Hollywood had found its savior. But his price was self-imposed censorship which would rule Hollywood for forty years. <b>DVD X1780 [preservation copy] Video/C 6156</b><br></dd>
<dd>â€¢149; <b>Hollywood. 4, Hollywood Goes to War.</b> Contents: "Includes rare footage and excerpts from": Hearts of the world (1918) -- The Big parade (1925) -- What price glory (1926) -- Wings (1927) -- Battle cry of peace (1915) -- Civilization (1916) -- Intolerance (1916) -- Heart of humanity (1919) -- My four years in Germany (1918) -- All quiet on the Western Front (1930)<br>
The outbreak of World War I provided Hollywood with one of its greatest sources of plots - and profits. As the American mood shifted away from neutrality, Hollywood followed, abandoning films with pacifist themes for stories of war at the front. With the arrival of peace, war films vanished until King Vidor made The Pig Parade in 1925, followed by What Price Glory and All quiet on the Western Front. <b>DVD X1781 [preservation copy]; vhsVideo/C 6157</b><br></dd>
<dd>â€¢149; <b>Hollywood. 5, Hazard of the Game.</b> Contents: "Includes rare footage and excerpts from": Play safe (1923) -- The Black pirate (1926) -- Lilac time (1928)<br>
Silent films are often remembered for their physical gags--always good for a laugh. But behind these gags lay planning, courage and skill. With the notable exception of Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. and Harold Lloyd, stuntmen took the risks while the stars took the credit--and it was a firm rule that no stuntman could reveal the tricks of his trade. Here at last, legendary stuntmen Yakima Canutt, Harvey Parry, Bob Rose and Paul Malvern tell the hair-raising stories behind their greatest stunts. <b>DVD X1782 [preservation copy] Video/C 6158</b><br></dd>
<dd>â€¢149; <b>Hollywood. 6, Swanson &amp; Valentino.</b> Contents: "Includes rare footage and excerpts from": Sadie Thompson (1928) -- Queen Kelly (1928) -- The Sheik (1921) -- The Eagle (1925) -- Pullman bride (1917) -- Male and female (1919) -- Zaza (1923) -- Manhandled (1924) -- Stage struck (1925) -- Loves of Sunya (1927) -- Sunset Boulevard (1950) -- Four horsemen of the Apocalypse (1921) -- Blood and sand (1922) -- Monsieur Beaucaire (1924) -- Son of the shiek (1926)<br>
Two great stars personified Hollywood: Gloria Swanson and Rudolph Valentino. She sacrificed everything for stardom. He did nothing to seek the adoration which ultimately engulfed him. Swanson recalls her meteoric rise--and fall--with remarkable candor. Valentino's brother, Alberto, helps tell the story of the young Italian who became the silver screen's Great Lover--but whose private life failed to match his public image. <b>DVD X1783 [preservation copy] Video/C 6159</b><br></dd>
<dd>â€¢149; <b>Hollywood. 7, The Autocrats.</b> Contents:"Includes rare footage and excerpts from": Male and female (1919) -- The Ten Commandments (1923) -- Foolish wives (1922) -- Greed (1925) -- Queen Kelly (1928) -- The cheat (1915) -- Forbidden fruit (1921) -- Manslaughter (1922) -- King of Kings (1927) -- Wedding march (1928) -- Heart of humanity (1919) -- Blind husbands (1919) -- Mery-go-round (1923) -- Merry widow (1925) -- Sunset Boulevard (1950)<br>
Two of Hollywood's greatest directors were Cecil B. DeMille and Erich von Stroheim. But what they shared in achievement, they never shared in success. DeMille worked within the studio system; von Stroheim, against it. And while DeMille's lavish productions reaped huge profits for the studios despite the millions they cost, von Stroheim's films were doomed to be hatcheted by the studio, if even released. <b>DVD X1764 [preservation copy] Video/C 6180</b><br></dd>
<dd>â€¢149; <b>Hollywood. 8, Comedy-- A Serious Business</b> Contents:"Includes rare footage and excerpts from": Making a living (1913) -- The Pawnshop (1916) -- Luke's movie muddle (1916) -- The General (1926) -- Curtain pole (1909) -- The rink (1916) -- The floorwalker (1916) -- The kid (1921) -- Never weaken (1921) -- Hot water (1924) -- Steamboat Bill Jr. (1928) -- One week (1920) -- Strong man (1926)<br>
One of the first things filmmakers learned in Hollywood was how to make people laugh. Comedy was king, and battling for the throne were four box office rivals--Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, Harry Langdon and Charlie Chaplin. In an era brimming with the visual, their comedy was the work of genius. <b>DVD X1785[preservation copy] Video/C 6161</b><br></dd>
<dd>â€¢149; <b>Hollywood. 9, Out West</b> Contents: The Massacre (1912) -- The Return of Draw Egan (1916) -- Hell's hinges (1916) -- Tom's strategy (1916) -- Lady of the dugout (1918) -- Great K&amp;A train robbery (1926) -- Straight shooting (1917) -- Covered wagon (1923) -- Iron horse (1924) -- Winning of Barbara Worth (1926)<br>
The Old West was still there when the movies arrived. Cowboys and outlaws saw a heaven-sent chance to relive their youth--and get paid for it--by working in films. The man who really started the "Western Craze" was the Wild West showman William Cody, who made the film The life of Buffalo Bill in 1913. Tom Mix was the next western screen hero, followed by William S. Hart, who dignified the genre with films like Narrow Trail and Tumbleweeds. These films were a celebration of the West, establishing a tradition that continues to this day. <b>DVD X1786 [preservation copy] Video/C 6162</b><br></dd>
<dd>â€¢149; <b>Hollywood. 10, The Man with the Megaphone</b> Contents: "Includes rare footage and excerpts from": Mare Nostrum (1926) -- Sunrise (1927) -- The Crowd (1928) -- Snow people (1928) -- Blue jeans (1917) -- Daddy long legs (1919)<br>
Silent film directors were a flamboyant breed--pioneers who invented the art of film direction as they went along. Working conditions were chaotic. Open sets were built side by side and back to back, and live "mood" music was provided according to each star's taste. Despite deafening noise and constant distraction, directors talked their cast through every move and emotion, and from this confusion came great films. <b>DVD X1787 [preservation copy] Video/C 6163</b><br></dd>
<dd>â€¢149; <b>Hollywood. 11, Trick of Light.</b> Contents: "Includes rare footage and excerpts from": Way down East (1920) -- Intolerance (1916) -- Birth of a Nation (1915) -- The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1926) -- The beast at bay (1912 ) -- Liquid electricity (1907) -- Children in the house (1916) -- Down to the sea in ships (1922) -- Viking (1931) -- Man that might have been (1914) -- Cheat (1915) -- Four horsemen of the apocalypse (1921) -- Enchanted cottage (1924) -- Mysterious lady (1928) -- Ella Cinders (1925) -- Little Lord Fauntleroy (1921) -- Juggernaut ( 1915) -- Robin Hood (1922) -- Ben Hur (1926)<br>
In the early days of Hollywood, directors relied heavily on their cameramen. While their cameras may have looked primitive, when handled by a skilled craftsman, a pretty girl was transformed into a "screen goddess." Individual cameramen were invaluable to both studios and stars. With the help of art directors, they achieved some of the most amazing and dangerous sequences ever filmed. <b>DVD X1788 [preservation copy] Video/C 6164</b><br></dd>
<dd>â€¢149; <b>Hollywood. 12, Star Treatment.</b> Contents: "Includes rare footage and excerpts from": The Merry Widow (1925) -- The Big parade (1925) -- Flesh and the devil (1926) -- Love (1927) -- Down to the sea in ships (1922) -- Plastic age (1925) -- Dancing mothers (1926) -- Mantrap (1926) -- Children of divorce (1927) -- Hoop-la (1933) -- Temptress (1926) -- Man, woman and sin (1927) -- Hollywood review of 1929 -- His glorious night (1929) -- Redemption (1930)<br>
Producers discovered that if they didn't have a star, they didn't have a hit. Creating stars became a business in itself, and soon, the Hollywood Star System was born. From it came such greats as Clara Bow, Lillian Gish and John Gilbert, who inherited the title "Great Lover" from Valentino. The ruining of John Gilbert's career vividly illustrates how producers could make or break a star. When Gilbert fell in love with Greta Garbo he punched Louis B. Mayer after Mayer passed a remark about her. Mayer vowed to ruin Gilbert's career--and made good on his threat. <b>DVD X1789 [preservation copy] Video/C 6165</b><br></dd>
<dd>â€¢149; <b>Hollywood. 13, End or an Era.</b> Contents: The Jazz singer (1927) -- Lilac time (1928) -- Lights of New York (1928) -- Anna Christie (1930) -- So this is Paris (1926) -- A movie star (1916) -- De forest phonofilm (1922) -- King on Main Street (1925) -- Theodore Case test (1925) -- Stage struck (1925) -- Old ironsides (1926) -- Witt &amp; Berg (1926) -- Don Juan (1926) -- Singing fool (1928) -- Peacock Alley (1929) -- Sky hawk (1929) -- Black watch (1929) -- Iron mask (1929) -- Four sons (1928) -- Showgirl in Hollywood (1930)<br>
Throughout the early to mid-twenties, more and more films were made with synchronized sound and music, but it wasn't until 1927 that Warner Brothers gambled on talking pictures with "The Jazz singer". From that moment on, all that had shaped and created Hollywood was utterly transformed. Talking pictures were here to stay, and the art of silent filmmaking--along with many of the stars, directors and producers devoted to it--were sacrificed to technology. <b>DVD X1790 [preservation copy] Video/C 6166</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>[HerzogЖ, Werner] Ecstatic World of the Filmmaker Werner Herzog (Bis ans Ende-und dann noch Weiter: die ekstatische welt des flimemachers Werner Herzog)</b></dt>
<dd>A film essay by Peter Buchka analyzing Herzog's work through extracts from his films and statements by the filmmaker himself. From the very outset of Herzog's film career, his intellectual quest has taken him to marginal groups. In their ecstatic isolation he has sought to regain a measure of humanity and human dignity. Herzog's heroes generally fail, however, in a measure proportional to the effort they expend -- which is precisely what makes them heroes in Herzog's eyes, because it elevates their stories to the level of myths. 60 min.

Kopple also talks about her latest project; a study of the Woodstock festivals called My Generation. Next up is director and producer Susan Seidelman, one of the first filmmakers to be lauded by Hollywood as a "bankable" female director.

<dt><b>[KubrickЖ, Stanley] Dark Side of the Moon</b></dt>
<dd>The progress of film and television technology has made it possible to manipulate images without it being obvious. This documentary begins with the revelation that director Stanley Kubrick contributed to the success of the US space program with his film "2001: A space odyssey." With the support of NASA, Kubrick invented an astonishing scenario for the images of the moon landing, validating it with "hijacked" archival footage, false documents, and authenic interviews out of context. As the documentary progresses it forces the viewer to realize how difficult it is to separate truth from manipulation in the media. 2002. 52 min. <b>Video/C MM393</b><br>
