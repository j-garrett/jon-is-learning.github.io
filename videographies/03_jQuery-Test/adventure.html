<dt><b>Robin Hood</b> (1922)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Allan Dwan. Cast: Douglas Fairbanks, Wallace Beery, Sam De Grasse, Alan Hale, Enid Bennett, William Lowery, Willard Louis. When King Richard the Lion-Hearted leads a crusade to the Holy Land, his evil brother John claims the throne, and an era of corruption ensues. The Earl of Huntington is transfigured into the heroic Robin Hood, who leads his followers against Prince John and the Sheriff of Nottingham to reclaim England for King Richard. An early silent big-screen spectacle that ranks as one of the monumental accomplishments of the era, 'Robin Hood' is staged on a herculean scale. Its sets were erected by an army of 500 carpenters and towered 90 feet in the air, covering ten acres of land, historically accurate to the smallest detail. 120 min. <b>DVD 972</b></dd>

"M", head of the British Secret Service, sends the newly promoted 007 on his first mission that takes him to Madagascar, the Bahamas and eventually leads him to Montenegro to face Le Chiffre, a ruthless financier under threat from his terrorist clientele, who is attempting to restore his funds in a high stakes poker game at the Casino Royale. "M" places Bond under the watchful eye of the Treasury offical Vesper Lynd. At first skeptical of what value Vesper can provide, Bond's interest in her deepens as they brave danger together. Le Chiffre's cunning and cruelty come to bear on them both in a way Bond could never imagine, and he learns his most important lesson: Trust no one.

During the Napoleonic Wars, a British frigate, the HMS Surprise, and the larger French warship, Acheron, stalk each other off of the coast of South America.

The ship's surgeon balances the violence of his chosen life with the quiet demeanor of the scientist. He is the captain's friend and confidant, the two frequently playing violin and cello duets together. 138 min. <b>DVD 4633</b></dd>
