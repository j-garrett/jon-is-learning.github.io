<dd>Directed by Karl Grune. Cast: Fritz Kortner, Adrienne Ames. "In 1908, Sultan Abdul Hamid rules the Turkish Empire, but he is faced with the threat of revolt by the Young Turk party. He allows Hilmi Pasha, the leader of the Young Turks, to return from exile and form the country's first constitutional government. With tensions still growing, chief of police Kadar Pasha assassinates Hassan Bey, the leader of the Old Turk party, and makes it look as if a Young Turk committed the crime, in order to give Abdul an excuse for arresting the Young Turk leaders. Meanwhile, Abdul becomes infatuated with a visiting Austrian singer. When she rejects his advances, she endangers both herself and her fianc&eacute;, a Turkish officer who also knows who really shot Hassan Bey."

<dd>Directed by Samuel Fuller. Cast: Paul Kelly, C. Henry Gordon, Marc Lawrence, Lorna Gray, Robert Fiske. In this desert adventure, a cruel commander viciously rules a regiment of French foreign legionnaires.

The soldiers inside take the leader back and he helps to vanquish the invaders. Later the ring leader of the mutineers is awarded a medal for his courage and then court-martialed for his crime. The leader too gets his just desserts when his second-in-command tells the court of his superior's cruelty. 56 min. <b>DVD X2350</b></dd>

<dt><b>Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp</b>(1939)</dt>
<dd>Animated short. Directed by Dave Fleischer. "Olive has a job at Surprise Pictures as a script girl when she dreams up a story of Popeye in the Aladdin tale. Popeye is a poor young man tricked by an evil magician who tries to use him to get the lamp. The plot fails, and Popeye uses the lamp to become a prince and woo the princess of old Persia (played by Olive). The magician tricks the princess into giving him the lamp, and takes her for himself. Even Aladdin/Popeye and the genie of the lamp (who looks and sounds like comedian Lew Lehr) are no match for the wicked villain until spinach defeats his evil power, allowing our hero to marry the princess. In the end, Olive's story is rejected by the movie studio, and the dream ends with Olive in a sea of scripts."

<dt><b>Lawrence of ArabiaЖ</b> (1962)</dt>
<dd>Director, David Lean. Cast: Alec Guinness, Omar Sharif, Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quinn, Jack Hawkins, Anthony Quayle, Claude Rains. The story of T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole), the heroic and troubled man who organized the Arab nations to fight the Turks in World War I and then, having reached a pinnacle of power in Mideast politics, retired to postwar military obsurity. " The Arab as Unruly Child. Lawrence of Arabia (1962) remains the best-known example of the Arab as a political naif in need of tutelage from a wiser Westerner, often adorned in Arab garb -- a better Arab than the Arabs themselves (see Indiana Jones I and III). Remove that "guidance," and get the chaos of Lawrence's end: Arab leaders at one another's throats in a scene reminiscent of the depiction of black politicians in the racist Birth of a Nation."

<dt><b>One Arabian Night (Sumurun)</b> (Germany, 1920)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Ernst Lubitsch. Cast: Pola Negri, Ernst Lubitsch. "The richness of Max Reinhardt's stage direction of Friedrich Feska's play, THE ARABIAN NIGHTS, is transferred and adapted to the screen by Reinhardt's protege Ernst Lubitsch who, in his final acting performance, as the hunchback clown Buckliger, heads a sterling internationally flavored cast which he directs with his customary vigor in this German production, one of the last films made by Lubitsch in Europe. Upon the stage a masque, SUMURUN is remedied by Lubitsch of its static quality as he prescribes a non-stop folly of exuberance which the polyglot players are quite capable of providing, in particular Paul Wegener (Germany), Pola Negri (Poland), Aud Egede Nissen (Norway) and Jenny Hasselqvist (Sweden), each of whom performs strongly and adds lagniappes of interpretation to the scenario of Hans Kraly. Lubitsch, a veteran of the Yiddish stage, generally as Meyer the Jew, is a clear guide to his actors in this melodramatic tale of a sheikh (Wegener) who desires to add an itinerant dancing girl (Negri) to his harem because of his dissatisfaction with his principal houri (Hasselqvist) who in turn desires a young wandering merchant with whom she shares a strong physical attraction. Buckliger is in love with the gypsy dancer, but the mulatta role portrayed by the diminuitive Negri is one who has learned to trust only the adornments of wealth and is therefore most willing to become a harem resident, a prospect which she finds most cordial although, of course, many complications come about involving, among others, the son of the sheikh. Lubitsch's unique style, which incorporates the frequent use of innuendo, found favor in Hollywood, principally with Mary Pickford who, because of her viewing of SUMURUN, was able to entice the director to the United States, bringing Negri with him, as they had shared many Continental successes, and after her career was macerated by her emotional excess and strong accent, the director continued on to great acclaim, praised for his "Lubitsch touch". This touch is in evidence in this silent German film as it continued to be in his subsequent English language efforts and is essentially the conjugating of the lashes of one eye."

<dt><b>Valentino's Ghost</b></dt>
<dd>Valentino's Ghost takes viewers on a chronological journey through more than a century of images of Muslims, Arabs and Islam in the U.S. media, from the early 20th-century fantasies of romantic sheiks to today's damaging stereotypes as evil fanatics. The film shows the way in which the changing image of Arabs and Muslims has mirrored America's political agenda in the Middle East. Valentino's Ghost enables viewers to put stereotypical representations of muslims and Arabs in historical context to sharpen their media literacy and increase their skills in questioning media representations, especially those of minority groups and people with whom our government is in conflict. The film ends with a report of a few Hollywood films that have provided complex images and avoided ethnic stereotyping. Written and directed by Michael Singh. Extras include "22 minutes of extended interviews with Robert Fisk, Niall Ferguson, John Mearsheimer, Melani McAlister, Alan Sharp plus 5 clips [2:32] from comics Aron Kader and Maz Jobrani." 93 min. <b>DVD DVD X6815</b><br>
