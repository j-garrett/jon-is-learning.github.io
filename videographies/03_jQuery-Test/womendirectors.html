<dt><b>Der Wald vor lauter B&auml;uman (The Forest for the Trees)</b> (Germany, 2003)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Maren Ade. Cast: Eva Lobau, Daniela Holtz, Jan Neumann. Bursting with idealism, Melanie Proschle, a young teacher from the countryside, starts her first job at a high school in the city; however, things don't go quite as she planned. She had hoped to be a 'fresh breeze' to the school, but her colleagues are annoyed by her new teaching methods. Not only that, Melanie hasn't one friend in her new town. Trying not to get discouraged, she attempts to form a relationship with her neighbor Tina. As Melanie's efforts become more and more desperate, Tina begins to withdraw. Soon Melanie is crossing borderlines and entangling herself in a spiral of lies. 81 min. <b>DVD 6335</b></dd>

This is an original blend of 'backstage' musical and working class comedy inflected by a popular feminism which displaces masculinity from the centre of Australianess as expressed in the rocker comedy. 94 min. <b>DVD X6153</b></dd>

<dd>Directed by Catherine Breillat. Cast: Anne Parillaud, Gregoire Colin, Roxane Mesquida, Ashley Wanninger, Dominique Colladant, Bart Binnema, Yves Osmu, Francis Seleck, Elisabete Piecho. For director Jeanne, sex is no laughing matter. She doesn't find it funny that her two leading actors can't stand each other when she's about to shoot the most important moment in her film ... the sex scene. The actress objects to nudity, the actor won't take off his socks, and the only thing heating up between them is their tempers. At her wits' end, Jeanne tries everything in her power to seduce, intimidate and sweet-talk her reluctant young lovers into performing the film's sexy final scene. 95 min. <b>DVD 3840</b></dd>

<dt><b>Die Praxis der Liebe (Practice of Love)</b> (West Germany / Austria, 1984)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Valie Export. Cast: Adelheid Arndt, Rudiger Vogler, Hagnot Elischka. Combines a thriller narrative with experimetal images to tell the story of Judith, a television journalist, whose investigation of murder implicates her two male lovers (an arms dealer and a psychiatrist). Through these relationships Judith discovers that in a world of male power struggles, love is complicit, marginal or impossible. The film makes a strong coherent indictment of male-dominated society. "Valie Export's third feature is an anti-romance in which the heroine, oscillating between two relationships, gradually discovers that both are impossible, not because the subjective processes of "love" are defective, but because the objective, social matrix in which both her male lovers operate is corrupt, immoral, murderous: in this film, the male world and its power structures cancel the possibility of love beyond the matter of sexuality, that is the objectification of love. Export makes use of techniques drawn from her earlier experimental cinema, video and conceptual photography to expand the possibilities of narrative feature filmmaking and to disintegrate some of its overdetermined conventions." -Ѭ href="http://www.wmm.com/filmcatalog/pages/c337.shtml">Gary IndianaЖ 90 min. <b>DVD X7252; DVD 7775 (PAL); vhs 999:619</b></dd>

<dt><b>Gaumont Treasures: 1897-1913</b></dt>
<dd>This collection looks at pioneering French filmmakers from the Gaumont studio, with extensive examples of their work. Few individual artists have exerted as profound an influence upon the evolution of cinema as Alice Guy (later known as Guy-Blach&eacute;). With this collection of more than 60 films, culled from the world's leading archives and carefully mastered, Guy may no longer be seen as a "woman filmmaker." These films, produced by Guy for Gaumont before she moved to the U.S., reveal her to be an unqualified pioneer of motion pictures.</dd>

<dd>Directed by Manijeh Hekmat. Cast: Roya Nonahali, Roya Taymourian, Pegah Ahangarani, Golab Adineh, Maryam Boobani. Famously 'banned' for more than a year by Iranian authorities, this taboo-breaking film is based on Manijeh Hekmat's long fieldwork, among women prisoners in Iran. She depicts the lives of Iran's lost generation in the two decades since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, using the claustrophobic life of women behind bars as a metaphor for the entire society. Her protagonist, Mitra, is in prison for killing her violent stepfather. On the eve of a prison riot she confronts Tahereh, the new warden, whose dogmatic views she challenges fearlessly. Over the course of the next 20 years, Tahereh's attitude toward her prisoners changes and oftens, which reflects the country's shifting political stance. Eventually Mitra, aged and exhausted, is finally released, but Tahereh left behind, is now more like a prisoner herself. 106 min. <b>DVD 6866</b></dd>

A wartime story [1943] that is both a character study and a mesmerizing cat and mouse game between a Polish Catholic farmer and a Jewish woman who has escaped a train bound for the Nazi death camps. Set in Silesia during WWII, the drama unfolds with the concealment of the woman by the wealthy, sexually repressed farmer, and moves through various stages of power and powerlessness on both sides. The battle between the two is dispassionate yet haunting in its portrayal of this ill-fated relationship. 102 min. <b>DVD 6834</b></dd>

<dt><b>Barbara Kopple &amp; Susan Seidelman.</b></dt>
<dd>A segment from a TV series offering a behind-the-scenes look into the creative process of independent filmmaking. In the first part of the program Erika Muhammad interviews director Barbara Kopple about the motivations behind many of the films of her career, which include the Academy-Award winning documentaries Harlan County, USA and American Dream. Kopple also talks about her latest project; a study of the Woodstock festivals called My Generation. Next up is director and producer Susan Seidelman, one of the first filmmakers to be lauded by Hollywood as a "bankable" female director. After making Desperately Seeking Susan and some subsequently critically panned films, she moved on to television's Sex and the City on HBO. Here she also discusses her new film, Gaudi afternoon.

<dt><b>Not Wanted</b> (also known as <b>Shame</b>, and <b>Streets of Sin</b>) (1948)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Elmer Clifto and Ida Lupino [uncredited]. Cast: Sally Forrest, Keefe Brasselle, Leo Penn, Dorothy Adams, Wheaton Chambers. In 1948, legendary screen actress Ida Lupino left Warner Bros. to co-found The Filmmakers, an independent production company conceived as an alternative to the dominant aesthetics of Hollywood. With the low-key, intimate 'Not Wanted' Lupino tackled the 'taboo' topic of out-of-wedlock pregnancy, immediately venturing into terrain where big-budget mainstream fantasy-spinners feared to tread. In many ways this extraordinary first directorial effort, while uncredited, already bears the stamp of Lupino's unique vision: the remarkable empathy felt for the lead character Sally Forrest as the dazed, traumatized young waitress thrust into the world of unwed motherhood, the hallucinatory moments ... of the childbirth sequence, and the deft location-shooting as Forrest wanders through the bus stations and boarding houses of small-town America.<b>DVD 8679; vhs 999:3452</b></dd>

<dt><b>My Name Was Sabina Spielrein (Ich hiess Sabina Spielrein)</b> ((France | Germany | Sweden | Denmark | Finland | Switzerland, 2002) )</dt>
<dd>Directed by Elisabeth M&aacute;rton. Cast: Eva Osterberg, Lasse Almeback, Mercedes Csampai, Palle Granditsky, Natalia Usmanova. Featuring the voices of Maria Thorgevsky, Dan Weiner, Helmut Vogel, and Alan Pryke. A docu-drama based on a find of letters and diaries that revealed a love affair between Carl Jung and his first patient, Sabina Spielrein. Her cathexis was rapid and she formed an intense attachment to her young doctor, who seems to have reciprocated. But after a note from Sigmund Freud on the nefarious nature of females, the doctors hatched the theory of counter-transference to explain their feelings. Luckily, this wouldn't be Sabina's final contribution to psychoanalysis. Pronounced cured, she became a psychoanalyst herself and, within eight years, was practising alongside the founding fathers. 90 min. <b>DVD X3970</b></dd>

There, indelibly marked, she confronts her deeper loneliness and a devastating sense of exile.

A discussion on these issues held in Berlin, Fall 2004, was used as a framework for the film.

Women had to live in silence, a silence so profound, they may come to doubt their own past -- even their own existence -- yet they survived these political realities with courage, comradeship, and the resources of their bodies. 127 min. <b>999:3204</b></dd>

<dd>Directed by Rosa von Praunheim. Cast: Beryt Bohlen, Bernd Feuerhelm, Ernst Kuchling. Credited with being a catalyst in the formation of gay liberation groups in several German cities, this politically charge drama paints an unflattering portrait of gay life structured around one man's sexual coming out and political maturation. As David begins the process of finding himself he uncovers the diversity and sordidness of Berlin's gay underground. He has his first affair, becomes involved with the "wrong crowd," visits numerous gay bars, and eventually settles down in an enlightened homo-hippie commune. Von Praunheim damns gay men's aping of bourgeois heterosexual society's values, painting a bleak picture of stereotypical gay men engulfed in a self-destructive lifestyle. Dubbed in English. 67 min, <b>vhs 999:3472</b></dd>
