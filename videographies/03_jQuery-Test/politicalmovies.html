<dt><b>All the King's Men</b>(2006)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Steven Zaillian. Cast: Sean Penn, Jude Law, Kate Winslet, James Gandolfini, Mark Ruffalo, Patricia Clarkson, Kathy Baker, Jackie Earle Haley, Anthony Hopkins. Willie Stark is an uncorrupted small-town mayor in 1950s Louisiana. He gets picked by the political machine to run as a wild card candidate in the upcoming gubernatorial race. But, when Willie realizes that he is being manipulated, he veers off on his own to become the darling of the electorate's downtrodden and forgotten hicks. Covering the campaign for a local paper is Jack Burden, whose editorial pieces become so admiring of Willie that he's fired. But, when Stark wins, Burden hires onto the new governor's team as a personal aide. Once in office, Governor Stark antagonizes the state legislature, the oil companies, and the moneyed classes with his share-the-wealth promises to the sweaty masses. Legislators become so outraged that they start serious impeachment talk, a move supported by the admired and retired Judge Irwin, who also happens to be Jack's godfather. Based on the life of Huey Pierce Long, governor of Louisiana and senator.

<dt><b>Charlie Wilson's War</b> (2007)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Mike Nichols. Cast: Tom Hanks, Amy Adams, Julia Roberts, Philip Seymour Hoffman. In the early 1980s, Charlie Wilson is best known as a womanizing US congressional representative from Texas. He seemed to be in the minor leagues, except for the fact that he is a member of two major foreign policy and covert-ops committees. However, once Charlie is prodded by his major conservative supporter, Joanne Herring, Wilson learns about the plight of the people who are suffering from the effects of the brutal Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. With the help of the maverick CIA agent, Gust Avrakotos, Wilson dedicates his canny political efforts to supply the Afghan mujahideen with the weapons and support needed to defeat the Soviet Union. Ultimately, Charlie learns that while military victory can be obtained, there are other consequences and prices to that fight that are ignored to everyone's sorrow. Based on a true story. Based on the book by George Crile. 102 min. <b>DVD 9627</b></dd>

<dt><b>Citizen Kane</b> (1941)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Orson Welles. Cast: Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten, William Alland, Everett Sloane, Agnes Moorehead. When one of the world's richest and most influential men dies muttering the word "Rosebud", a newspaper's managing editor insists that Kane's obituary film is missing something and "needs an angle." He orders his top reporter Thompson (Alland) to discover what "Rosebud" means. Thompson searches for, finds, and interviews five key figures, but ulimately does not solve the mystery. At one point in his career Kane runs for governor against corrupt political boss Jim Gettys. Gettys discovers that Kane has a mistress and uses this information to blackmail him into quitting the race. Despite the hurt that scandal will bring to his family and the mistress, Kane refuses, convinced that he has the love of the electorate. He is mistaken, however, and loses the race. Because Kane was purportedly based on newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst, efforts were made to surpress the film, by 'Hearst hatchet woman' Louella Parsons, among others. 119 min. <b>DVD 852; VHS 999:85</b></dd>

<dd>Directed by Elia Kazan. Cast: Andy Griffith, Patricia Neal, Anthony Franciosa, Walter Matthau, Lee Remick, Kay Medford, Bennett Cerf, Virginia Graham, Burl Ives, John Cameron Swayze, Mike Wallace, Walter Winchell. Lonesome Rhodes, a big ol' teddy bear of a man, sits in a dusty, squalid Arkansas jail, swapping stories with his fellow drifters and plunking on his guitar. It's not much of a life -- until a chance encounter skyrockets Lonesome to TV fame and more money, and power than even the greediest man can handle.<br>
"A Face in the Crowd addresses many of the same issues [as All the King's Men] in its tale of Lonesome Rhodes (Andy Griffith), a hillbilly singer who parlays his television popularity into a political movement promoting the presidential campaign of the right-wing Senator Fuller, "last of the isolations." Rhodes is betrayed by an open microphone that allows the audience for his nationwide broadcasts to hear his contemptuous statements about the "sheep" who believe his speeches."

<dt><b>Mission to Moscow</b>(1943)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Michael Curtiz. Cast: Walter Huston, Ann Harding, Oscar Homolka, George Tobias, Gene Lockhart. Mission to Moscow was made at the behest of F.D.R. in order to garner more support for the Soviet Union during WWII. It was from the book by Joseph E. Davies, former U.S. Ambassador to Russia. The movie covers the political machinations in Moscow just before the start of the war and presents Stalin's Russia in a very favorable light; so much so that the movie was cited years later by the House Un-American Activities Commission and was largely responsible for the screenwriter, Howard Koch, being blacklisted. Based on the book by Joseph E. Davies. 123 min. <b>DVD X592</b></dd>

<dt><b>Red Menace.</b> (1949)</dt>
<dd>Directed by R. G. Springsteen. Cast: Narrator: Lloyd G. Davies ; cast: Robert Rockwell, Hanne Axman. Anti-Communist propaganda in the form of a story about a disgruntled ex-soldier. When he gets no help from the Veterans Bureau, he is ripe for the influences of Communists who lead him down the party line. But he soon meets up with disillusioned party members who attempt to break out. When released this film caused a sensation with its anti-Communist theme. It was a clear sign of the times--McCarthyism in America.<br>
"Restored by the UCLA Film and Television Archive, The Red Menace was produced by Herbert J. Yates, founder and president of Republic Pictures. Like other Hollywood producers in 1949, he was eager to prove his loyalty to the government. The Senate Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities rewarded him with a commendation for his work on this film." [from video container] 87 min. <b>DVD X5614; vhs 999:2002</b><br></dd>
