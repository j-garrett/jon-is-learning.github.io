<dt><b>From Swastika to Jim Crow</b></dt>
<dd>Before and during the Second World War Jewish scholars who escaped Nazi Germany and immigrated to the U.S. faced anti-Semitism at major universities and a public distrust of foreigners, so a significant number secured teaching positions at historically Black colleges in the South.

<h3>Diasporic Communities Outside the US</h3>
<dt><b>Acts of Faith: Jewish Civilization in Spain</b></dt>
<dd>Many Latinos in the American Southwest wear amulets and perform certain practices different from their fellow Latino Catholics--and are discovering only now, to their amazement, that they are descended from Jews who chose conversion rather than death at the time of the great expulsion from Spain in 1492. This film looks at remnants of what was once the great Jewish civilization in Spain: the artifacts, which were Christianized or destroyed; and the people, many of whom continued to practice elements of the religion and folklore of Judaism and for most of whom the memory of Jewishness has been extinguished. 1995. 50 min. <b>Video/C 6562</b><br>

<dt><b>The Believers: Stories from Jewish Havana</b></dt>
<dd>With the coming of the Communist Revolution in 1959, many of Cuba's 15,000 Jews chose to leave.

In 1994, only about 1,300 Jews still lived in Cuba. This program presents interviews with Cuban Jews, chiefly attendees at Gran Sinogoga de la Comunidad Hebrea, Adath Israel, Shevet Achim and Centro Hebreo Sefaradi de Cuba. A video by Bonnie Burt.

<dt><b>The Letter P: The Story of Pulcinella.</b></dt>
<dd>At the beginning of the 17th century the Italian commedia dell'arte introduced the hunchback Pulcinella for the mirth and mockery of its audiences. Pulcinella's popularity outlived the commedia itself. His diasporic tale of ancient Roman curses, Marranism, and escape from Fascist Italy to Argentina is recounted here in an interview by the Italian Radio Network RAI Otto. The revelation of Pulcinella's Judaic roots challenges the benign public image of the commedia dell'arte and casts the shadow of modernism over its not-so-innocent origins. Pulcinella survives the 20th century a complex and alienated figure--the thoroughly modern man. A film by Margaret Fisher. 1997. 25 min. <b>Video/C 5670</b><br></dd>

Reports from research groups indicate a major increase in anti-Semitic incidents since the year 2000, with the worldwide annual average number of major violent incidents nearly doubling from 1990s levels. It is particularly severe in Western Europe, where research shows that since the year 2000, Muslim and Arab youths were increasingly responsbile for attacks against Jews and Jewish properties. Meanwhile outside of Europe, in more and more Arab and Islamic communities around the world, there is an alarming increase in anti-Semitic rhetoric in the political and public arenas, especially in the mainstream media.

Key members of the Bank of England together with their German counterparts established the BIS, the Bank for International Settlements, which laundered the plundered gold of Europe, while other banks froze the accounts of French Jews depriving them of the money to escape.

<dd>A film by P&eacute;ter Forg&aacute;cs. Originally shot between 1936 and 1966 by Jeno, a banker living in Budapest, the film shootings are of he and his wife and dog but it also presents the City of Budapest itself, in snow, fog and rain, with photography of sensual accuracy. In the midst of this peaceful landscape, Nazi troops, bombardments, flechees Crosses, and Jewish work camps cross the images of Jeno. This film is a poem, which sets up a breathtaking memorial to the vanishing representatives of the Hungarian middle class. 1989. 45 min. <b>DVD 3202</b><br></dd>

<dd>Footage pertaining to the Jewish holocaust, American liberation of France, concentration camp survivors, and the invention of atomic bomb. Part of a ten-part series that surveys historical events of the 20th century using Gaumont British newsreel footage. Covers major advances, trends, and tragedies, from political upheavals and passing social crazes to the role of technology, and examines their impacts on the future. This segment documents events from 1939-1945. World War II instigates 6 years of violence, massacres and devastation. In many countries everyday life is reduced to hunger, escape and survival. Footage focuses primarily on the homefront and the resiliency and creativity of the citizens of Europe, Russia and the U.S. in meeting the challenges and heartbreaks of war. <b>DVD X1252</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>A Film Unfinished</b></dt>
<dd>At the end of WWII, 60 minutes of raw film in an East German archive was discovered. Shot by the Nazis in Warsaw in May of 1942, the film became a resource for historians seeking an authentic record of the Warsaw Ghetto. The later discovery of a long-missing reel, including multiple takes and cameramen staging scenes, complicated earlier readings of the footage. Presented here is the raw footage in its entirety, falsely showing the 'good life' of Jewish urbanites. Contents: Lost history -- Jewish Council -- "I might see my mother" -- Flowers, furniture, teapot -- Auerswald's reports -- Willy Wist, cameraman -- Garbage and lipstick -- Waiting to die -- Smuggling -- Underground Jewish archive -- Surprising discovery -- Dinner and theater -- "A Jew film" -- Death -- Ghetto in color -- "Today I can cry" -- Faces. Written and directed by Yael Hersonski. Special features: Death Mills (1945, 22 min.; directed by Billy Wilder; new telecine made from archival 16mm elements) ; Interview with author and film researcher Adrian Wood (ca. 15 min.) ; scholar Michael Berenbaum on A Film Unfinished (ca. 4 min.) 2010. 90 min. <b>DVD X5412</b><br>

<dt><b>Forgiving Dr. Mengele</b></dt>
<dd>Tells the story of a shocking act of forgiveness by Auschwitz survivor Eva Mozes Kor and the firestorm of criticism it has provoked. Eva and her twin sister, Miriam, were victims of Nazi doctor Josef Mengele's cruel genetic experiments--an experience that would haunt them their entire lives. We follow Eva's metamorphosis from embittered survivor to tireless advocate for reconciliation. This unexpected transformation was sparked when Eva, in an attempt to get information about the experiments, met with another former Auschwitz doctor. Eva's ideas about justice, revenge and the possibility of healing through forgiveness--as well as the passionate opposition from other survivors--become a window to a larger discussion of the many ways people define forgiveness.

<dt><b>The Fuehrer Gives a City to the JewsЖ (F&uuml;hrer schenkt den Juden eine Stadt)</b></dt>
<dd>This is the only film known to be made by the Nazis inside an operating concentration camp. This insidious propaganda film was produced in 1944 in Theresienstadt, the "model" ghetto established by the Nazis in 1941 in Terezin, a town in the former Czechoslovakia. Goebbels intended to use the film to prove to the International Red Cross and the world that Jews were being well-treated in the camps. The film is an elaborately staged hoax presenting a completely false picture of camp life. Upon completion, the director and most of the cast of prisoners were shipped to Auschwitz. Only a few survived to attest to the falsity of the film. Includes a filmed segment from a performance by prisoners of Terezin of Hans Krasa's children's opera <i>Brundibar</i>.

<dt><b>The Maelstrom: A Family Chronicle.</b></dt>
<dd>A film by P&eacute;ter Forg&aacute;cs. Makes artful use of home movies shot in the Netherlands before and during WWII dealing with the extended Peereboom family. Information is conveyed through English subtitles and period sound, usually from radio broadcasts and a disturbing jazz score by Tibor Szemzo. What we see is a Jewish family first living unknowingly in the shadow of the Holocaust and then trying to cope with it still unaware of what it will finally mean. Shots of the family cheerfully sewing and doing preparations for a trip to a "work camp," when their destination is in reality Auschwitz, adds a devastating dimension to the understanding of Hitler's "final solution." 1997. 60 min. <b>DVD 3215</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>One Survivor Remembers.</b></dt>
<dd>One Survivor Remembers, the Academy Award Winner for Best Documentary Short. What makes One Survivor Remembers memorable is its storyteller... Gerda Weissman, a Polish-born Jew who lost her entire family to the Holocaust. With grace and dignity she eloquently describes her experiences during the war and her memories of her mother, father, and brother from whom she was forcibly separated. Gerda spent three years in slave labor camps along the Polish-German border. Her parents were deported to Auschwitz. During the war's final stages, the Nazi's forced Gerda and 2,000 other women on a three-month death march in the dead of winter. On the eve on her 21st birthday, Weissman and 150 others who survived this ordeal were liberated by an American infantry division. Among the American soldiers was Kurt Klein, a German-born Jew who had escaped to the United States. He later became Gerda's husband. Kurt's parents also died in concentration camps. One Survivor Remembers is a testement to courage and perseverence. It offers viewers a chilling sense of the terror and devastating tragedy endured by millions who suffered at the hands of the Nazi regime, but One Survivor Remembers is also a story of hope. Now, over 50 years later, Gerda and Kurt Klein have chosen to tell their remarkable story. The documentary includes current and historical footage shot on location in Poland and the Czech republic.

<dt><b>Respite</b></dt>
<dd>A film by Harun Farocki. Archival footage shot at the Westerbork transit camp in the Netherlands for Jews waiting for transportation to "the East" during WWII. The film documents how well they were treated, but these positive images are constantly interrogated by the use of titles. The vision of camp inmates peacefully boarding trains is intercut with titles asking: "Do they know where they are going? Are they optimistic because, if they are being filmed, they can't be going anywhere bad?" None knew what Auschwitz was. 2007. 40 min. <b>DVD 9987</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>Unwanted Cinema (Unerwunschtes Kino)</b></dt>
<dd>For many Jewish filmmakers, actors, actresses, writers, directors and other creative talents, the rise of Hitler and the Nazi party first threatened their livelihoods and soon their lives. In 1934 the exclusion of Jewish filmmakers in Germany led to independent productions in Budapest and Vienna, the so-called "Unwanted Cinema" banned by the Nazis. This documentary profiles a number of Jewish artists who contributed to independent films produced in Vienna and Budapest between 1934 and 1937. The film follows them in subsequent years, as they sought refuge from the Nazi terror, both in Europe and the U.S. The film focuses on Henry Koster, Ernst Verebes, Otto Wallburg, Felix Joachimson (Jackson), Hans Jaray, Franziska Gaal, Rosy Barsony, Hortense Raky, Oskar Pilzer, and Zoltan Vidor. Featuring scenes from many films of the period, Unwanted Cinema also recounts the efforts of Hollywood producer Joseph Pasternak, who offered many of these men and women their best chance of survival. Based on the book: <i>Unerwunschtes Kino : der deutschsprachige Emigrantenfilm 1934-1937</i> (MAIN: PN1993.5.E83 U54 2000) 90 min. <b>DVD 9910</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>Nuremberg: les Nazis face &agrave; leurs crimes</b></dt>
<dd>Nuremberg, November 20, 1945--The trials of Nazi war criminals begins. The United States, France, Great Britain and the USSR unite to deliver exemplary justice in response to crimes against peace and, for the first time in history, to "crimes against humanity". As evidence, films of the liberation of the concentration camps would be screened, confrontations arise, testimonies of executioners and victims are heard. After 10 months of hearings, the verdict is rendered: 12 defendants sentenced to death penalties, including one in absentia, seven sentenced to prison and three acquitted. Thus ends the trial that paved the way for the creation of international tribunals. Disc 1. French and English versions of the film -- Disc 2.

Although the first trial of major war criminals was concluded successfully with death or imprisonment for those found guilty, the subsequent trials were compromised by Cold War politics. Many imprisoned Germans were pardoned and restored to power if they were considered useful to the West, overturning the American commitment to justice.

<dt><b>The Nuremberg Trials.</b></dt>
<dd>In November, 1945, the twenty-two surviving representatives of the Nazi elite stood before an international military tribunal in Nuremberg, Germany. The ensuing trial pitted U.S. Chief Prosecutor Judge Robert Jackson against Hermann Goring, the former head of the Nazi air force. Jackson hoped the trial would make a statement that crimes against humanity would never again go unpunished. Draws upon rare archival material and eyewitness accounts to re-create the dramatic tribunal that defines trial procedure for state criminals to this day. Produced and directed by Michael Kloft.

<dt><b>The Specialist: Portrait of a Modern Criminal</b></dt>
<dd>A documentary about the 1961 trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem. Eichmann, the Nazi mastermind who organized the deportation of Jews and other "undesirables," escaped capture and fled to Argentina. In 1960, Israel agents discovered Eichmann and abducted him in a daring secret mission. The whole world was watching as Eichmann was tried in Jerusalem for "crimes against humanity." Using the original footage of the trial made by Leo Hurwitz, this is a "mesmerizing portrait of a horribly ordinary man" and an important addition to the field of Holocaust studies. Special DVD features: 60 minute interview with authors Rony Brauman and Eyal Sivan; excerpt from the book "In praise of disobedience"; original theatrical trailer. Inspired by "Eichmann in Jerusalem, a report on the banality of evil" by Hannah Arendt. Produced entirely from footage recorded in 1961 in Jerusalem at the Adolf Eichmann trial by Leo Hurwitz. A film by Rony Brauman &amp; Eyal Sivan. 128 min. <b>DVD X16 Video/C 7264</b><br>

In this playful, often moving portrait of fathers and sons, the video artists Paik and Kubota subject their content to irreverent temporal, spatial and visual transformations: images multiply and proliferate, time is accelerated or slowed, and the audio is de-synchronized. 1982. 29 min. <b>Video/C 4679</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>The American Tapestry: Searching for the American Dream</b></dt>
<dd>Gregory Nava's trenchant but human examination of the American migration experience. In this documentary the much celebrated Hispanic filmmaker ("El Norte", "Mi Familia", "Selena", etc.) explores the very personal accounts of five American families from a variety of enthnic and racial backgrounds. An elderly Polish Jew relates his arrival at Ellis Island as a seven year-old boy in the 1920's. A Chinese-born grandmother from Oakland, California recalls her own childhood arrival on Angel Island in San Francisco Bay in the early 1930's. Unlike the Ellis Island experience, which was a happy and welcoming one, her arrival thrust her into an atmosphere charged with racial tension, discrimination and hostility. An African-American woman, the daughter of a slave, describes her childhood on a sharecropper's farm in Alabama and her eventual migration to Chicago. In the film's most emotionally powerful moment, he follows a young Mexican woman as she risks her life clandestinely crossing the border into the U.S. Directed by Gregory Nava. 1999. 96 min. <b>Video/C MM1281</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>Miss Universe 1929: Lisl Goldarbeiter, A Queen in Wien</b></dt>
<dd>Amateur filmmaker Marci Tanzer began to photograph and film his beautiful cousin Lisl when he moved to Vienna from Szeged in the late 1920s. In 1929 she won the title of Miss Austria and later was voted the first Miss Universe. Her privileged life as a beauty queen and later a rich wife ended with the Nazi takeover of Austria, but the two of them eventually married.<br>
"Lisl Goldarbeiter and Marci Tenczer -born in 1908- were cousins and knew each other since early childhood. The Goldarbeiters lived in Vienna and belonged to the Austrian wing of a large Austro-Hungarian Jewish family. The Tenczer's lived in Szeged, and formed the Hungarian wing. The family ties between Vienna and Szeged never ceased. Marci moved to Vienna in 1926, to study. The first anti-Semitic law in Europe, the Hungarian Numerous Clauses of 1922, made it impossible for Jews to enter a University in Hungary. Marci lived in the house of the Goldarbeiters and studied at the Technical University from 1926-1936. Marci secretly loved his cousin Lisl. He started to make films of her, her family and Vienna shortly after his arrival. He was very poor but succeeded in saving cash for his film hobby by walking the city, instead of taking the tram. In 1929, without telling anybody, Marci caused Lisl's entry into the world of beauty; and she became world famous."
