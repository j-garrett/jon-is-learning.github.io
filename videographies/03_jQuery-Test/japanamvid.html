<dt><b>Foresaken Fields</b></dt>
<dd>Before World War II, many Japanese-Americans had settled successfully as farmers in California. But when the war came, they were incarcerated under government orders and forced to sell their farms. When the war ended, many did not return to their rural homes, and those who did never recovered from the interruption in their lives. As their children moved away to college or jobs or to be with other families, there was a second forsaking of the fields. Japanese-American farming in California is a mere shadow of what it once was, yet it created the foundation for California agriculture as it is today. 2000. 2000. 27 min. <b>Video/C 8895</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>9066 to 9/11</b></dt>
<dd>Looks at the World War II-era treatment of Japanese Americans as seen through the contemporary lens of the post-9/11 world. As the U.S. government fights a "war on terrorism" its tactics and policies have caused concern for some Americans of Japanese descent, who were interned in concentration camps during WWII. No new concentration camps have materialized, but mass deportations and detentions, particularly of Arab and Muslim immigrants in America, have forced a comparison of the two experiences, revealing striking similarities. Special feature: Something strong within / directed by Robert A. Nakamura ; produced by Karen L. Ishizuka (1994, 40 min.). 2004. 20 min. <b>DVD 3097</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>Fighting For Justice: The Coram Nobis Cases.</b></dt>
<dd>Panel moderator: Karen Narasaki. Panel: Fred Korematsu, Gordon Hirabayashi, Dale Minami (attorney), Rod Kawakami (attorney), Peggy Nagae (attorney). In 1942, three courageous men defied military orders that culminated in the incarceration of 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry during World War II. In three separate cases, Minoru Yasui, Gordon Hirabayashi, and Fred Korematsu were convicted of violating curfew and internment orders and their convictions were upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. Nearly forty years later this film traces the history of the young third-generation Japanese American legal teams that, in the 1980's, fought to right this injustice by invoking a rarely used legal procedure--a petition for a writ of error coram nobis, which asks that a trial court correct a fundamental error and injustice committed at the time of the trial. Concludes with a panel discussion featuring Korematsu, Hirabayashi and the lead attorneys for their cases. Produced and directed by Dianne Fukami and Gayle K.

<dt><b>Foresaken Fields</b></dt>
<dd>Before World War II, many Japanese-Americans had settled successfully as farmers in California. But when the war came, they were incarcerated under government orders and forced to sell their farms. When the war ended, many did not return to their rural homes, and those who did never recovered from the interruption in their lives. As their children moved away to college or jobs or to be with other families, there was a second forsaking of the fields. Japanese-American farming in California is a mere shadow of what it once was, yet it created the foundation for California agriculture as it is today. 2000. 27 min. <b>Video/C 8895</b><br>
