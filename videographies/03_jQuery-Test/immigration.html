Less inclined to learn English and join mainstream society than previous immigrant generations, recently arrived New Yorkers are nevertheless part of a long-established pattern--which former Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) praises, while New York State Senator Frank Padavan discusses fears that some conservative citizens harbor. 2005. 26 min. <b>DVD 4301</b><br></dd>
