Promoter Norman Granz insists on equal treatment for every member of his integrated troupes on his Jazz at the Philharmonic Tours. Meanwhile, bebop musicians Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker are creating some of the most inventive jazz ever played but a devastating narcotics plague sweeps through the jazz community, ruining lives and changing the dynamics of performance. And a number of great performers including Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, Gerry Mulligan, Thelonious Monk, Paul Desmond, Bille Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and John Lewis find new ways to bring new audiences to jazz. <b>DVD 495</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>William S. Burroughs: A Man Within</b></dt>
<dd>A documentary of William Burroughs: the Beats &eacute;minence grise, "literary outlaw," culture hero to generations of poets, musicians, artists, and filmmakers who had their minds blown by his 1959 classic, banned-in-America "Naked Lunch." This film covers his life in a straightforward manner, but the portrait drawn is at odds with the character who wrote in outlandish graphic detail about then-forbidden sexuality in the 1950s and '60s. Harvard-educated and conservative in his attire, Burroughs--despite fame and acclaim--was troubled, reserved, and battled with addiction his entire life. Despite the openness of his prose, this film reveals Burroughs in the contradictions he embodied--a man generously affectionate with friends and acolytes, whose avuncular veneer covered up a haunting, enduring loneliness. Narrated by Peter Weller; commentators, John Waters, Peter Weller, James Grauerholz, Amiri Baraka, V. Vale, Dennis M. Dailey, Ira Silverberg, Laurie Anderson, Victor Bockris, Patti Smith, Marcus Ewert, Gus Van Sant, Genesis Breyer P-Orridge, Barry Miles, Regina Weinreich, Diane DiPrima, Iggy Pop, Tom Peschio, Wayne Propst, Robert McColl, Fred Aldrich, Patricia Elliot Marvin, Dean Ripa, Anne Waldman, John Giorno, Steve Silberman, David Cronenberg, Thurston Moore, Lee Ranaldo, Jello Biafra, Hal Willner, Grant Hart; archive footage, Allen Ginsberg, Andy Warhol.Written, and directed by Yony Leyser. c2011. 87 min. <b>DVD X5309</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>The Beats: An Existential Comedy</b></dt>
<dd>A film that captures the magic of the Beat generation and their continuing legacy expands into a larger discussion of what it meant to be a poet in America when the ignoble spirit of McCarthyism was loose in the land. From Venice to North Beach to Greenwich Village, the Beats found answers in Buddhism, friendship, and the power of their words. Using an emotional tone which is exactly right and a lovely style of filmic poetry, the beats are immortalized here with heart and soul.

In <i>Fireworks</i> a dissatisfied dreamer awakes, goes out in the night seeking a light and is drawn through the needle's eye to return less empty than before. <i>Puce Moment</i> reflects Anger's concerns with the myths and decline of Hollywood. <i>Rabbitt's Moon</i> is a fable of the unattainable (the Moon) combining elements of Commedia dell'Arte with Japanese myth. <i>Eaux d'Artifice</i> portrays hide and seek in a night-time labyrinth of levels, cascades, balustraces, grottoes and fountains. <i>Kustom Kar Kommandos</i> is a voyeuristic look at a tight-jeaned man polishing his car. Anger's short films represent a vision of "repressed homosexual desires, twarted in real life and painfully exorcized onscreen. Anger, a highschool student who had grown up on Hollywood's sanitized images, filled <i>Fireworks</i> with his hidden fantasies, complete with the bald sexuality inherent in the images of cowboys, test pilots and, in this case, sailors, images that dominated the dreams of millions."

"Given the Beats' feelings about American culture, many Beat works communicate a sense of cultural displacement. <i>Lost, Lost, Lost</i>... and Mekas' Guns of the Trees deeply affecting portraits of what it feels like in America in the fifties to be a "displaced person"--in all senses: linguistically, culturally, socially, imaginatively, and artistically. For a viewer with the patience to live through the experience along with Mekas, <i>Lost, Lost, Lost</i> is one of the most profoundly sad and moving works of the period. Both Lost, Lost, Lost and Guns of the Trees also demonstrate how for Mekas and his characters, as in the Beat movement more generally, the state of social marginality and imaginative alienation, however personally painful to experience, conferred some degree of freedom.
