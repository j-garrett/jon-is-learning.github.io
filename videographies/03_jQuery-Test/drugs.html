<dt><b>[Absinthe] The Four Earliest Known Absinthe-related Films</b></dt>
<dd>Presents four movies from the silent film era concerning the distilled, highly alcoholic spirit absinthe. Almost from the very outset motion picture producers found a lucerative niche producing films with an anti-alcohol message. The 1902 film "Les victimes de l'alcoolisme" was the first attempt by the newly formed Path&eacute; company to exploit the burgeoning demand for anti-absinthe and anti-alcohol propaganda. "Les Victimes de l'alcool" (1911), a far more sophisticated film, was enthusiastically promoted by the temperance movement and was a huge success for Path&eacute;. "Absinthe" (1913) is the only surviving U.S.-made absinthe related motion picture from the pre-ban era, featuring one of the very few filmed versions of absinthe being prepared and consumed. Contents: La Bonne absinthe / produced by Gaumont Film Company ; directed by Alice Guy (1899, 1 min.) -- Les Victimes de l'alcoolisme / produced by Path&eacute; ; directed by Ferdinand Zecca (1902, 4 min.) -- Les Victimes de l'alcool / produced by Path&eacute; ; directed by Gerard Bourgeois (1911, 26 min.) -- Absinthe / produced by the Gem Motion Picture Company ; starring Glen White and Sadie Weston (1913, 12 min.) <b>DVD X2294</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>Bank Dick</b> (1940)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Eddie Cline. Cast: W.C. Fields, Una Merkel, Cora Witherspoon, Franklin Pangborn, Shemp Howard, Grady Sulton. Egbert Souse accidently foils a bank robbery and is hired as a bank guard. "How could you pick a single performance from the late, great W.C. Fields to honor? He essentially played a drunk wallowing in some state of dysfunction or another in every movie he made. Perhaps our favorite for the purposes of the drunk list? His role as Egbert Souse ('soo-say!') in The Bank Dick, a classic Fields film by any measure. The quotes attributed to Fields (in character and out of it) are a running homage to drinking, including his classic line: 'A woman drove me to drink and I didn't even have the decency to thank her.' No, W.C. Thank you." [Ѭ href="http://www.filmcritic.com/features/2008/12/the-21-best-movie-alcoholics-of-all-time/">filmcritic.comЖ] 73 min. <b>DVD 4556; also DVD 291; VHS 999:110</b></dd>

<dt><b>La Bonne Absinthe</b> (1899)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Alice Guy. Long thought lost, this tiny flickering fragment from the dawn of film history - just 56 seconds long - is the earliest filmed version of an absinthe being prepared and drunk. Directed by the pioneer female director Alice Guy it tells a short, comical story: a man walks into a caf&eacute;, orders an absinthe, the waiter brings a bottle and adds a large dose to his glass, the man adds water from a carafe in an absent minded way while reading his newspaper, not realising that he's missing the glass entirely. Without looking he takes a deep drink, and almost chokes on the undiluted alcohol. In a rage he starts attacking the waiter with his cane. The waiter chases him away with a soda syphon, to the great amusement of the other onlookers. 56 sec. <b>DVD X2028</b><br></dd>

<dd>Directed by Otto Messmer. Animated short. "Long before Felix the Cat used his magical &ldquo;Bag of Tricks&rdquo; to foil the nefarious plans of the Professor, Rock Bottom, and the Master Cylinder (Anyone else grow up in the 70&rsquo;s?) he got bombed out of his skull in the silent short subject Felix the Cat Woos Whoopee. The plot of the cartoon is simple--Felix carouses until 6 a.m. at the Whoopee Club, chugging beer, wine, and anything else he can lay his hands on, while his wife waits up impatiently with a rolling pin. As the fuddled feline teeters home, monstrous hallucinations block his path, including dragons, a winged ape, and a walking trombone. It&rsquo;s a toss up as to whether the missus or Felix&rsquo;s own imagination poses a greater threat to his well being."

<dt><b>The Thin Man series</b></dt>
<dd>Featuring the hard-drinking, urbane husband and wife detective team, Nick and Nora Charles. "The important thing is the rhythm," Nick explains to a bartender, cocktail shaker in hand. "You always have rhythm in your shaking. Now, a Manhattan you shake to fox-trot time. A Bronx, to two-step time. But a dry martini you always shake to waltz time." Nick is joined a few moments later by his wife and his wire-haired terrier. The former inquires how much he's had to drink and is told he's on his sixth martini. As she downs her first, she flags down a waiter: "Will you bring me five more martinis and line them up right here?"<br></dd>

Meanwhile, the family waits. He arrives home late and abusive. The next day, hung over, he takes much less convincing to have the drinks; he's gone so long that his wife sends a daughter looking for him. She eventually finds him, can't convince him to return home, goes home, sees her mother's distress, and returns to the bar. This time, her father gets more abusive, a fight ensues, a shot is fired, and tragedy strikes. <b>DVD X3234; vhs 999:593; vhs 999:2775</b></dd>

<dt><b>You're Telling Me!</b> (1934)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Erle C. Kenton. Cast: W.C. Fields, Larry "Buster" Crabbe, Joan Marsh, Adrienne Ames, Louise Carter, Kathleen Howard, Tammany Young, Del Henderson, James B. "Pop" Kenton, Robert McKenzie, Nora Cecil, George Irving. Sam Bisbee is an inventor who is the laughingstock in his small town. After demonstrating another failed invention, he meets a princess who promises to use her celebrity to turn his luck around. "Although W.C. Fields drank immoderately on and off camera, he rarely played a scene in which he appeared pie-eyed drunk. The major exception can be found in You&rsquo;re Telling Me, the first sound film in which the Great Man was given the solo lead. The movie opens with a masterful drunk scene, in which Fields staggers home, removes his shoes to avoid waking his wife, loses his hat repeatedly, and has to resort to using a funnel to insert his key into the keyhole. Once indoors, he gets caught in the decorative ropes that hang from the hallway curtains and nearly strangles himself in his efforts to become disentangled."

<dd>Directed by Scott Kalvert. Cast: Faye Dunaway, Mickey Rourke, Alice Krige, J. C. Quinn, Frank Stallone. "Film adaptation of street tough Jim Carroll's epistle about his kaleidoscopic free fall into the harrowing world of drug addiction. As a member of a seemingly unbeatable high school basketball squad, Jim's life centers around the basketball court and the court becomes a metaphor for the world in his mind. A best friend who is dying of leukemia, a coach ("Swifty") who takes unacceptable liberties with the boys on his team, teenage sexual angst, and an unhealthy appetite for heroin -- all of these begin to encroach on young Jim's dream of becoming a basketball star. Soon, the dark streets of New York become a refuge from his mother's mounting concern for her son. He can't go home and his only escape from the reality of the streets is heroin for which he steals, robs and prostitutes himself. Only with the help of Reggie, an older neighborhood friend with whom Jim "picked up a game" now and then, is he able to begin the long journey back to sanity."

Schoolteacher Ed Avery, who's been suffering bouts of severe pain and even blackouts, is hospitalized with what's diagnosed as a rare inflammation of the arteries.

<dd>Directed and written by Conrad Rooks. Cast: Jean Louis Barrault, William S. Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, Swami Satchidananda, Ornette Coleman. The bizarre hallucinations of a heroin addict in withdrawal provide the basis for this unstructured, semi-autobiographical film by director Conrad Rooks. It begins as protagonist Russel Harwick arrives strung-out in Paris for a sleep-cure. As the strange visions begin, the story jumps haphazardly between 'reality' and Harwick's dream-world memories of growing up in Chappaqua, New York. The score was composed and played by sitarist Ravi Shankar. 82 min. <b>DVD X5667; vhs 999:2818</b></dd>

<dd>Directed by Gaspar No&eacute;. Cast: Nathaniel Brown, Paz de la Huerta, Cyril Roy, Olly Alexander, Masato Tanno. "Tokyo's nasty underside, seen primarily through the eyes of Oscar, a druggie, whose sister Linda is a stripper. Oscar also has flashbacks to his childhood when trauma upends the siblings. Oscar's drug-fed hallucinations alter Tokyo's already-disconcerting nights, and after the police shoot him, he can float above and look down: on his sister's sorrow, on the rooms of a love hotel, and on life at even a molecular level. The spectrum's colors can be beautiful; it's people's colorless lives that can be ugly. And what of afterlife, is there more than a void?" [IMDB] 161 min. <b>DVD X5558</b></dd>

<dt><b>I Love You Alice B. Toklas</b>(1968)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Hy Averback. Cast: Peter Sellers, Jo Van Fleet, Leigh Taylor-Young, Joyce Van Patten. One day you're a career 9-to-5er with a pending marriage, and then next you know, you chuck it all for beads, bell-bottoms and free love. This is the life of Harold Fine, a dedicated lawyer about to become a more dedicated dropout. "Films such as I Love You Alice B. Toklas! (1968) and Easy Rider (1969) can be used to demonstrate the changing attitude towards drug culture during the 1960's and 1970's. Marijuana was commuted, as were the laws surrounding its possession, from "killer weed" to "drop-out weed." As it became popular with middle-class white university students, its stigma was diminished greatly; so much so that it was decriminalised in eleven U.S. states. It is during this period that marijuana is portrayed openly in films as a peaceful and even enlightening natural substance. I Love You, Alice B. Toklas is a charming comedy focusing on the mid-life crisis of the main character played by Peter Sellers. He meets a sweet flower child and is introduced to the hippie world of counterculture and pot. As Frank Thompson, in his article, "Movies on Drugs", writes, "marijuana is an entirely positive force in Toklas; everyone who uses it (even unwittingly Sellers' aging parents) emerges more thoughtful, aware, spontaneous - freer." I was hard-pressed to find films in any of the other historical periods that portray pot in such a benevolent light. Even Cheech and Chong are shown to be at best dull-witted and slow."

<dt><b>Modern Times</b> (1936)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Charlie Chaplin. Cast: Chaplin, Paulette Goddard, Henry Bergman, Stanley Sandford, Chester Conklin, Hank Mann, Allan Garcia, Stanley Blystone, Dick Alexander, Cecil Reynolds, Myra McKinney. The Little Tramp is an oppressed assembly-line factory worker who is used as a guinea pig for his employer's test of a new "Automatic Feeding Machine". He battles it out with technology, unemployment, jail, burglars, demanding customers and bosses. In the midst of his tribulations, he meets up with the girl of his dreams, "The Gamin". They win some and lose more but, at the end, they walk undaunted into the sunrise.<br>
"In Chaplin&rsquo;s Modern Times (1936), the comic played a convict who accidentally pours cocaine on his food after it had been hidden in a salt cellar. He becomes a &reg;ghter, stops a prison riot and ends up a hero of the hour. This was the last gasp for anything remotely funny about drugs on the screen and for drug &reg;lms in general for the next 20 years [2]. And then, for a variety of reasons, cocaine itself virtually disappeared from the illicit drug scene for an even longer period." [Shapiro, Harry.

<dt><b>Sherlock Holmes</b><br></dt>
<dd>â€¢149;<b>The Hound of the Baskervilles</b> Directed by Sidney Lanfield, 1939. Cast: Basil Rathbone, Nigel Bruce, Richard Greene, Wendy Barrie, Lionel Atwill. The first of the fourteen Sherlock Holmes films starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. The final scene represents the only reference any of the 14 films made to Holmes' "seven-percent" cocaine habit as Rathbone asks Bruce to retrieve "the needle." The scene, criticized as too risque by 1939 audiences, caused the film's producers to make a conscious decision to omit any additional mention of Holmes' recreational drug use in future outings. 80 min. <b>DVD 4321</b><br></dd>
<dd>â€¢149;<b>The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes.</b> Directed by Billy Wilder, 1970. Cast: Robert Stephens, Colin Blakely, Genevieve Page, Christopher Lee. "It's easy to see what Wilder loved about Holmes. Brilliant, irascible, witty, impatient, cultured and cynical, Holmes was a bundle of the same paradoxes as Wilder himself. Holmes' cocaine addiction, included as an aside in several Holmes stories, fascinated Wilder, as the very symbol of decadence. Here, Holmes' needle points to the curiosities and bizarre, even diabolical behavior which walks the streets of Victorian London, just as Wilder's Berlin of the 1920's had hosted its own happy perversions and fin-de-siecle revels."

<dd>Directed by Michael Winterbottom. Cast: Steve Coogan, Keith Allen, Rob Brydon, Enzo Gilenti, Ron Cook, Chris Coghill, Paddy Considine, Danny Cunningham, Dave Gorman, Sean Harris. "Manchester 1976: Cambridge educated Tony Wilson (Steve Coogan), Granada TV presenter, is at a Sex Pistols gig. Totally inspired by this pivotal moment in music history, he and his friends set up a record label, Factory Records, signing first Joy Division (who go on to become New Order) then James and the Happy Mondays, who all become seminal artists of their time. What ensues is a tale of music, sex, drugs, larger-than-life characters, and the birth of one of the most famous dance clubs in the world, The Hacienda - a mecca for clubbers as famous as the likes of Studio 54. Graphically depicting the music and dance heritage of Manchester from the late 70's to the early 90's, this comedy documents the vibrancy that made Mad-chester the place in the world that you would most like to be."

<dt><b>Flowers of Shanghai (Hai shang hua)</b> (Taiwan, 1998)</dt>
<dd>Director, Hou Hsiao-hsien. Cast: Tony Leung Chiu-wai, Michiko Hada, Lee Yu-ming, Carina Lau Ka-ling. Based on the 1894 novel by Han Ziyun this film is set in the elegant brothels of late nineteenth century Shanghai, a hermetic world with its own highly ritualized codes of behavior, where "flower girls," must win, and then hold, the affection of their wealthy callers. "Time does not so much pass as pass out; reflecting perhaps the film's unabashed opium smoking, a scene will fade unexpectedly into black, then reawaken, minutes or months later, in the same lacquered interior burnished by filtered light, or in a different one very much like it. The tableaux are like the frenzies of some gaudy insect trapped in amber."

<dd>Directed by Dwain Esper and Vival Sodar't. Narcotic is loosely based upon the life of William Davies, an opium-addicted snake oil salesman who was also producer Hildagarde Esper's uncle.

<dt><b>The Quiet American</b>(USA / Germany / Australia, 1996)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Phillip Noyce. Cast: Michael Caine, Brendan Fraser, Do Thi Hai Yen, Tzi Ma, Robert Stanton, Holmes Osborne, Pham Thi Mai Hoa, Quang Hai, Rade Sherbedgia. A story that led to the events of the United States military involvement in Vietnam. Here, a love triangle between a British journalist(Michael Caine) named Thomas Fowler, his mistress, and a mysterious CIA operative evolves into a much greater mystery that eventually leads to murder and deception. "The film's real feat may be in its production design, in the sumptuousness and veracity with which it re-creates central Saigon and the Vietnamese countryside of the '50s: an exotic lost world of brothels and opium dens, trishaws and ao-dai dresses, Ming-deco interiors and water buffalos in rice paddies."
