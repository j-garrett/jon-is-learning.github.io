<dt><b>[Bari, Judy] The Forest for the Trees.</b></dt>
<dd>On May 29, 1990, Earth First! organizer Judi Bari's car was bombed in Oakland, California. Within three hours of the bombing, Bari was accused of transporting the explosives that had nearly killed her. Still in the hospital, she was arrested, and soon labeled a terrorist in the national media. The charges were later dropped. For the next twelve years, Bari and civil rights lawyer Dennis Cunningham would pursue a federal civil rights suit against the FBI and the Oakland police department. This documentary, directed by Cunningham's daughter, is an intimate, behind-the-scenes look at Bari's fight, an important instance of the false and damaging association of dissent with crime and terrorism. At the heart of the film is Bari, a folk hero with an electrifying onscreen presence, and the legal battle that few believed she could win. Director, Bernadine Mellis. 2005. 60 min. <b>DVD 5893</b>

<dt><b>[<a name="Burroughs" id="Burroughs">Burroughs</a>, William] William S. Burroughs: A Man Within</b></dt>
<dd>A documentary of William Burroughs: the Beats &eacute;minence grise, "literary outlaw," culture hero to generations of poets, musicians, artists, and filmmakers who had their minds blown by his 1959 classic, banned-in-America "Naked Lunch." This film covers his life in a straightforward manner, but the portrait drawn is at odds with the character who wrote in outlandish graphic detail about then-forbidden sexuality in the 1950s and '60s. Harvard-educated and conservative in his attire, Burroughs--despite fame and acclaim--was troubled, reserved, and battled with addiction his entire life. Despite the openness of his prose, this film reveals Burroughs in the contradictions he embodied--a man generously affectionate with friends and acolytes, whose avuncular veneer covered up a haunting, enduring loneliness. Narrated by Peter Weller; commentators, John Waters, Peter Weller, James Grauerholz, Amiri Baraka, V. Vale, Dennis M.

<dt><b>[Bush, George H. W.] George W. Bush</b></dt>
<dd>Presents the first in-depth assessment of the forty-first president of the United States, drawing upon new scholarship and unparalleled access to figures in Bush's private and public life. Prior to winning the presidency, George Bush served as a U.S. congressman, ambassador to the United Nations, chairman of the Republican National Committee, chief of the U.S. Liaison Office to China, director of the C.I.A, and vice president under Ronald Reagan. Despite soaring approval ratings following military victory in the Persian Gulf, his years as president after the war were marked by unrelieved decline. As the economy faltered and a recession set in, the supply-side economic policies of the 1980s were questioned and Bush was forced to break his promise of "no new taxes." Further damaging his chances for reelection was the impression that he was more concerned with world affairs than the problems vexing Main Street, USA.

<dd>Henry Miller's literary works rely heavily on the autobiographical and the confessional.

Miller speaks frankly about the suicidal despair that led him to write Tropic of Cancer, his "disgust" with readers who bought the Tropic novels for their pornographic value, and his years of poverty - begging from friends, strangers, and even the mailman.
