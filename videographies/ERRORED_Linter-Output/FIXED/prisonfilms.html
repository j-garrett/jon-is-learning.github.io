<dt><b>Sullivan's Travels</b> (1941)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Preston Sturges. Cast: Joel McCrea, Veronica Lake, Robert Warwick, William Demarest, Margaret Hayes, Porter Hall, Franklin Pangborn, Eric Blore. A successful Hollywood director disguises himself as a bum and sets off to see America from the bottom up. In the midst of the brutality and despair, he makes a valuable discovery--that what the downtrodden need most is laughter. "Perhaps more than any other Sturges movie, Sullivan's Travels commits itself to extreme changes in mood and tone. The chase scene, and Lake's sped-up sprint through a backlot in hoop skirt and bloomers, are pure slapstick. At the other extreme is a chain-gang sequence of shocking realism for 1941 Hollywood."

<dd>Director, Alan Clarke. Originally commissioned in 1977 for the BBC's Play for Today series, but banned by the BBC before transmission. Writer Roy Minton approached Alan Clarke to have his social commentary screenplay remade as a feature film consisting of a largely unknown cast. Young juvenile offender Carlin is sent to a remote prison for boys. Upon arrival he finds a brutal authoritarian system completely uninterested in reforming any of the young charges; equally treacherous is the inmate hierarchy which he must learn to navigate. Carlin quickly ascends to the role of 'Daddy' or top dog, but not at a small price. Unfortunately others are not so savvy and fall afoul of the social system, leading to beatings, a brutal rape, a bloody suicide, and a vicious climactic revolt. 98 min. <b>DVD 5546</b></dd>

<dt><b>Women's Prison (Zendan-e zanan)</b> (Iran, 2002)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Manijeh Hekmat. Cast: Roya Nonahali, Roya Taymourian, Pegah Ahangarani, Golab Adineh, Maryam Boobani. Famously 'banned' for more than a year by Iranian authorities, this taboo-breaking film is based on Manijeh Hekmat's long fieldwork, among women prisoners in Iran. She depicts the lives of Iran's lost generation in the two decades since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, using the claustrophobic life of women behind bars as a metaphor for the entire society. Her protagonist, Mitra, is in prison for killing her violent stepfather. On the eve of a prison riot she confronts Tahereh, the new warden, whose dogmatic views she challenges fearlessly. Over the course of the next 20 years, Tahereh's attitude toward her prisoners changes and oftens, which reflects the country's shifting political stance. Eventually Mitra, aged and exhausted, is finally released, but Tahereh left behind, is now more like a prisoner herself. 106 min. <b>DVD 6866</b></dd>
