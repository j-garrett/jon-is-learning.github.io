<dt><b>Bizarre</b>(1969)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Antony Balch. Cast: Richard Shulman, Janet Spearman, Dorothy Grumbar, Anthony Rowlands, Valentine Dyall. "A brainy sex flick with a sense of humor, the film begins with a narrator/mummy who guides us through a number of vignettes promising to show what some of us go through in the pursuit of sexual pleasure. There's a fabulous ten minute opening, where the half naked go go dancers have vegetables thrown at them. One of the tales features a female photographer who tortures a male model. Another has a female burglar (Cathy Howard) caught by the house owner. The craziest involves a nerd hiring a blond call girl (Sue Bond) in pursuit of a menage-a-trois with his pet lizard; and there's a endearing misadventure with secret agent Lindy Leigh (Maria Frost) who does topless safecracking." [IMBD] Contains the world famous short films featuring William S. Burroughs "The cut ups" and "Towers open fire."

<dd>Director, Dwain Esper. Cast: Vivian McGill, Rose Tapley, Al Rigali, Mark Daniels, Linda Lee Hill. The evils of loose living and "unbridled lust" in promoting syphilis are detailed in this campy, overacted story of a small-town beauty queen with hopes of making it big in the city who contracts a venereal disease.

Here is the definitive history of pornographic films -- from silent-era sex on the bumper of a Model T Ford to soft-core to hard-core and anything goes... Includes bonus shorts from the 1930s and 40s: Roman holiday. Caught in the barbed wire. Nude diversion. Uncle Si and the sirens. Dressage au fouet. 90 min. <b>DVD 4296</b></dd>

<p>In <i>Fireworks</i> a dissatisfied dreamer awakes, goes out in the night seeking a light and is drawn through the needle's eye to return less empty than before. <i>Puce Moment</i> reflects Anger's concerns with the myths and decline of Hollywood. <i>Rabbitt's Moon</i> is a fable of the unattainable (the Moon) combining elements of Commedia dell'Arte with Japanese myth. <i>Eaux d'Artifice</i> portrays hide and seek in a night-time labyrinth of levels, cascades, balustraces, grottoes and fountains. <i>Kustom Kar Kommandos</i> is a voyeuristic look at a tight-jeaned man polishing his car. Anger's short films represent a vision of "repressed homosexual desires, twarted in real life and painfully exorcized onscreen. Anger, a highschool student who had grown up on Hollywood's sanitized images, filled <i>Fireworks</i> with his hidden fantasies, complete with the bald sexuality inherent in the images of cowboys, test pilots and, in this case, sailors, images that dominated the dreams of millions."

<dt><b>Color me Lurid: The Weird World of George Kuchar.</b></dt>
<dd>Twenty years before Blue velvet George Kuchar was obsessed with pop culture and kitsch. Part of the New York 'underground,' George and brother Mike were unusual in wanting to make lavish melodramas. Handpainted titles, lurid colour and sound, tabloid-type tales, startling hair-dos and vivid costumes blend and sometimes clash inimitably in these four startling, funny and bittersweet films.
<p>Contents: Hold me while I'm naked (1966, col., 15 min. With Donna Kerness, Hope Morris, Steve Packard, Andrea Lunin, George Kuchar) -- The mongreloid (1978, col., 9 min. With George Kuchar, Curt McDowell) -- Forever and always (1978, col., 21 min. With Olive M. Ayhens, Beau Brinkwater, Jan Ericson, Dona Frost) -- A reason to live (1976, b&amp;w, 27 min. Marion Smith collaborated with Kuchar on direction. With Curt McDowell, Maxine Duff-Davis, Marion Eaton, Robbie Tucker). 70 min. PAL format. <b>Video/C 999:3693</b></p>

Along the way this 325 pound transvestite checks out other jobs and ways of life. She becomes a mugger, prostitute and unwed mother before turning to murder. "Female Trouble" is a campy, bizarre, sadistic romp through society's outer fringe. 98 min. <b>DVD 2222</b></dd>

<dt><b>Flaming Creatures.</b> (1963)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Jack Smith. Sensual underground classic film which pushed the limits of its day while surviving attempts to censor its content, including a series of police raids, arrests, and court battles. "It may seem tame by today's standards, but it stretched the limits of its day. Campy and lavishly designed in its experimentalism, [Smith's] best know film, includes characters which cavort in a setting reminiscent of the court of Ali Baba, with a mood suggestive of the paintings of Heironymous Bosch. The film is a quasi-documentary of Androgynes and Transvestites in which flaccid penises and bouncing breasts are so ambiguously equated as to disarm any distinction between male and female. In Flaming Creatures, Smith manages to combine the ornate imagination of his youth with the realities of his adult fantasy." (from distributor's catalog) <b>Video/C 3258</b></dd>

<dt><b>Africa Speaks!</b></dt>
<dd>Narrator, Lowell Thomas. Documentary account of Paul Hoefler's photography expedition through central Africa in 1928-1929. Containing many varied and interesting shots of African tribes and wildlife, the film footage from it was later interpolated into many jungle-themed adventure movies. Originally released as a motion picture in 1930. 60 min. <b>Video/C MM536</b></dd>
<dt><b>Africana</b> (1957; 1984)</dt>
<dd>Long before the Italian Mondo Canes established the shockumentary genre, this American film set the groundwork. Although supposedly a "serious" documentary the filmakers went out of their way to film the weird and the wicked -- safari hunts, manhood initiation ceremonies, hot coal walkers, frenzied religious ceremonies where the participants pierce their bodies and so on. The film so perfectly foreshadowed the 1960's Mondo craze that the distributor later retitled and re-released it as "Mondo Africana." Originally released in 1957; edited and expanded version released in 1984. Produced and written by Cedric Worth. 80 min. <b>Video/C MM1034</b></dd>
<dt><b>Atrocities of the Orient</b>(1948)</dt>
<dd>A Philippine produced "shockumentary" recreating the widespread rapes and murders of Filipino women by Japanese soldiers during the WWII Japanese occupation, just before the American invasion. Also chronicles efforts by Filipino citizens to combat the invaders. 80 min. <b>Video/C MM538</b></dd>
<dt><b>Brutes and Savages.</b>(1977)</dt>
<dd>Produced and directed by Arthur Davis. Fascinated by forbidden rituals and ceremonies, world explorer Arthur Davis takes a crew with hidden cameras to Africa and South America to secretly record the beauty and horror of the "law of the jungle." Shocking, brutal and repulsive, this film mixes bizarre authentic footage with incredible (and often hilarious) "re-enactments" of his findings. Animal sacrifices, bizarre tribal ceremonies, mating rituals....and more. When first released in 1977, the film was cut to avoid problems with censors. This is the restored full length version. 107 min. <b>DVD 5113</b></dd>
<dt><b>Cannibal Holocaust</b>(1980)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Ruggero Deodato. Banned and heavily censored the world over, here is a film that is so intense, graphic and unflinching in its realistic portrayal of cannibalism that the director and producer were arrested upon its original release. Tells the story of a professor who searches for four documentary filmmakers who disappeared into "the green inferno," a.k.a. Amazon River country. Eventually he meets the tribe responsible for the crew's demise and returns to the U.S. with several rolls of "found footage." Disc 1. Cannibal holocaust -- Disc 2.

<dt><b>Cannibal Island</b>(1956)</dt>
<dd>The uncredited footage in Cannibal Island which appears to be of 1930's vintage takes the viewer to the savage South Sea islands where girls are girls, and men eat men. Shown are lovely topless Samoan girls and Melanesian pygmy cannibals.

<dd>Director, Sam Newfield. Cast: Billy Curtis, Yvonne Moray, Little Billy, Billy Platt, Fern McDill, Sam Newfield. A cast of midgets conduct the traditional rudiments of westerns, riding Shetland ponies and hauling the villain beneath the swinging doors of the saloon. 62 min. <b>DVD X531</b></dd>

<dt><b>Test Tube Babies</b>(1948)</dt>
<dd>Director, W. Merle Connell. Cast: Dorothy Dube, William Thomason, Timothy Farrell, John Michael, Peggy Roach, Stacey Alexander. A young couple faces the prospect of a childless marriage until they decide to try artificial insemination which at the time was considered a scandalous choice. Released on a theatre-by-theatre basis by clever entrepreneurs who stressed the film's "educational" aspects. The film was preceded by a real, live "authority" on the subject to field questions from the audience, and by dispensing tie-in pamphlets (at a dollar each). 83 min. <b>DVD X531</b></dd>
