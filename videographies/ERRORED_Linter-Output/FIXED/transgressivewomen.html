<dt><b>How Men Propose</b>(1913)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Lois Weber. Cast: Chester Barnett, Margarita Fischer, Grace Darling, Phillips Smalley. "How Men Propose illustrates Lois Weber's interest in male-female relationships, even in this early comic short. Structured around repetition and reversal, the comedy shows its heroine entertaining multiple marriage proposals from different suitors, each unaware of the other. If at first the humor seems to revolve around the heroine?s fickleness, those assumptions are reversed in the final scene. There we learn she is a professional journalist studying how men propose and wisely exploiting the men's willingness to be fooled by her feminine charms. By keeping viewers unaware of the heroine's motives until the end, the film challenges expectations about conventional male and female behavior."

She makes both women strong characters, but it's her Molly who stands out: blowzy, crude, aching with love and longing for class. 64 min. <b>DVD X5548</b></dd>

<dt><b>A Free Soul</b> (1931)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Clarence Brown. Cast: Norma Shearer, Leslie Howard, Lionel Barrymore, James Gleason, Clark Gable, Lucy Beaumont. In A Free Soul, Lionel Barrymore captured an Oscar for his portrayal of a brilliant alcoholic lawyer Stephen Ashe, who successfully defends dashing gangster Ace Wilfong (Clark Gable) on a murder charge only to find that his headstrong daughter, Jan (Norma Shearer), has fallen in love with his client. Jan, a fun-loving socialite seeking freedom from her blue-blood upbringing, is only too eager to dump her aristocratic boyfriend (Leslie Howard) for the no-good gangster. She runs away from her childhood home to become Ace's mistress, embarking on a series of seedy adventures in New York's underbelly. Desperate to save his daughter's tainted reputation, Stephen finds her and makes her a deal: He'll stop drinking if she'll stop seeing Ace. The thrilling conclusion might just tear them apart forever. Shearer and director Clarence Brown also received nominations for their work in this powerful and moving film. 93 min. <b>DVD 9397</b></dd>

<dt><b>Baby Face</b> (1933)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Alfred E. Green. Cast: Barbara Stanwyck, George Brent, Donald Cook, Alphonse Ethier, Henry Kolker, Theresa Harris, Margaret Lindsay, Arthur Hohl, John Wayne. It's the age-old story of the girl so mistreated by men that she's determined to get revenge. Lilly (Baby Face) sleeps her way from basement speakeasy bartender, literally floor by floor, to the top floor of a New York office building. Bank submanager Jimmy McCoy finds her a job in the bank only to be cast aside as she hooks up with the bank's president. "The Hays office recommended that the picture be pulled from the theaters for its violations of the production code. ...There was extensive correspondence between officials of the AMPP and Warner Bros. executives Darryl Zanuck and Jack L. Warner regarding various changes which were intended to make the film more acceptable to censor boards across the country. The main thrust of the changes was to attach an ending which showed Lily losing everything she had gained and returning to her hometown in order that viewers would not be tempted to believe that vice was rewarded. Originally the character of the cobbler professed a Nietzchian philosophy which was unacceptable under the production code. The character was changed to become instead the moral voice of the film, and was used to indicate that the character of Lily had been wrong to advance in the by using her body. Also cut were the most blantant references to the fact that Lily was being kept by men."

<dt><b>Female</b> (1933)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Michael Curtiz. Cast: Ruth Chatterton, George Brent, Lois Wilson, Johnny Mack Brown, Ruth Donnelly. In director Michael Curtiz's romantic comedy Female, Ruth Chatterton plays Alison Drake, the iron-fisted president of a motorcar company. Alison oversees the daily operations of her male employees with a predatory gaze and frequently exercises her right to engage with them in any way she deems fit. She meets her match in an equally strong-minded new employee, Jim Thorne (George Brent), and the two engage in a smoldering, contentious, sexually charged duel. The action of the film--one of the first to depict a female character turning a man's world to her advantage--feeds on the novelty of presenting a woman as a corporate shark and bedroom hound. Though it's obvious the filmmakers thought they were creating a scenario that would never actually happen, Alison's world-smashing exploits make the bulk of the film (before she begins to question her nontraditional lifestyle) a protofeminist romp. Brent and Chatterton were married at the time they made the film, and the natural chemistry between them is abundantly evident. Curtiz packs the screen with extravagant set design and period detail. 60 min. <b>DVD 9397</b></dd>

<dt><b>I'm No Angel</b> (1933)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Wesley Ruggles. Cast: Mae West, Cary Grant, Edward Arnold, Gregory Ratoff. The bold Tira works as a dancing beauty and lion tamer at a fair. Out of an urgent need of money, she agrees to a risky new number: she'll put her head into the lion's mouth! With this attraction the circus makes it to New York and Tira can persue her dearest occupation: flirting with rich men. Among the guys she searches for the love of her life, from whom she only knows from a fortune-teller that he'll be rich and have black hair. When she finally meets him, she becomes a victim of intrigue. "West, more imposing than coquettish as Tira the Lion Tamer, wields physical presence like a boxer and sexuality like a gunslinger throughout the film. From her opening scene, where she's introduced to a carnival crowd as "the girl who discovered you don't need feet to be a dancer," until the end, when she gets her man (Cary Grant, 29 years old and looking about 14, as upstanding society fellow Jack Clayton), Tira owns the screen. It's not hard to imagine either why I'm No Angel, often considered the last film of pre-code Hollywood, was the breaking straw for the Hays Office, or why Depression-era audiences loved it so much. Tira violates conventions of race, class, and (of course) sex, and she goes entirely unpunished by the plot of the film. Instead, West, who took sole credit for the story, screenplay and dialogue, is careful to give herself the last laugh--the real currency of a film like this one--in every scene. In the climactic trial, she cross-examines much of her romantic history to prove, to a judge and jury with whom she flirts hilariously, that she's "no angel" but that she is, indisputably, a heroine.

<dt><b>She Done Him Wrong</b> (1933)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Lowell Sherman. Cast: Mae West, Cary Grant, Owen Moore, Noah Beery, Gilbert Roland. Mae West as Lady Lou, a toughlady with a heart of gold, who dallys with assorted beaus, becomes entangled in murder, saves a Bowery mission and still has enough energy left to belt out a tune or two! "Is that a gun in your pocket or are you just glad to see me?" One of the lines that got Mae West in hot water and a Depression-stricken Paramount into the black, in Mae's blockbuster adaptation of her stage hit "Diamond Lil," with Salvation Army captain Cary Grant as the hunk she asks to "come up and see me sometime."
<p>"Mae West spent her career on the stage and screen skirting and sometimes transgressing the boundaries of sexual and moral propriety. In 1926 and 1927, she outraged some critics (and landed herself in jail) with two sensational Broadway productions, Sex (a play she wrote about a Montreal prostitute, in which she also starred) and <i>The Drag</i> (a 'homosexual comedy-drama' that she wrote and staged). In 1928, New York police arrested her again, this time for her play about a troupe of female impersonators, <i>Pleasure Man</i>. In 1932, she brought her brand of ribald humor to the movies. West's move from Broadway to Hollywood was surprising, given the substantially tighter moral scrutiny under which the film industry operated."

"Letty, a young woman who ended up pregnant, unmarried and on the streets at fifteen is bitter and determined that her child will not grow up to be taken advantage of. Letty teaches her child to lie, steal, cheat and anything else he'll need to be street smart. We meet Letty when Mickey is 7-1/2. Mal enters the picture when his truck and Mickey, who is hanging on to the back of a delivery truck and being pulled along the streets on his roller skates, collide. Mickey is not injured badly, but when Letty discovers that Mal is rich, she concocts a scheme to take Mal to the cleaners. When her plot is uncovered, Letty is also discovered for the unfit parent that she is, and Mickey is taken away from her. Mal and his wife Alice, unable to have children of their own, take Mickey in and give him a father's love, a true mother's love, and a home he can call his own. Letty is jealous of Mickey's growing attachment to these two good people and she still sees Mal as a ticket to riches. Letty seduces Mal, records the seduction and then plans to blackmail Mal. Her plans are upset when Mal immediately tells his wife, and Alice accepts the relationship. Letty learns a painful lesson in selfless love and finally sees that what is best for Mickey is more important than her own plans."

<dd>Directed by Richard Boleslawski. Cast: Irene Dunne, Melvyn Douglas, Thomas Mitchell, Thurston Hall, Elisabeth Risdon, Margaret McWade, Spring Byington, Nana Bryant, Henry Kolker, Leona Maricle, Robert Greig, Frederick Burton. A staid Connecticut town is scandalized when it discovers that the author of a sexually-explicit bestselling novel is actually a local girl. Based on an original story by Mary McCarthy. "Information in the MPAA/PCA Collection at the AMPAS Library reveals that Columbia first submitted the script to the PCA in Mar 1936. However, the PCA rejected the script because it violated several tenets of the Code. In a letter to Harry Cohn, PCA president Joseph I. Breen details the various elements in violation of the Code: The heroine, Theodora, exemplifies "evil made to appear attractive" after she breaks up two marriages; all the "decent" and "church-going" characters are "made to appear ridiculous, stupid and silly" when compared with their city counterparts, who "indulg[e] in extra-marital activities, drunkenness and debauchery, [and] are made to appear attractive." A second revised script was submitted to the PCA in Apr 1936 and was met with approval."

A London photographer's model proceeds from an immature marriage into a series of shady affairs-- first with a television talker, then with a slick promotion man, and ultimately in a palazzo as the loveless wife of an Italian prince. After becoming a prisoner of her own success through these disastrous affairs, she realizes the awful price she has paid for happiness. This is a slashing social satire and a devastating spoof of the synthetic, stomach-turning output of the television-advertising age. 122 min. <b>DVD X1043; vhs 999:3014</b></dd>

<dt><b>Little Vera (Malenkaya Vera)</b> (Soviet Union 1988)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Vasily Pichul. Cast: Natalya Negoda, Andrei Sokolov, Yuri Nazarov, Lyudmila Zajtseva, Aleksandr Negreba, Aleksandra Tabakova. The title character of the Russian Little Vera is a headstrong teenage girl, played by Natalya Negoda. To the dismay of her parents, Vera lives only for the moment, making no provision for her future. She'd rather hang out at local cafes in garish makeup and provocative clothing. A chance meeting with handsome student Sergei (Andrei Sokolov) develops into a sexual relationship. Her parents send out Vera's brother (Alexander Alexeyev-Negreba) to talk some sense into her. This proves doubly dicey when it turns out that the brother is an old acquaintance of the rebellious Sergei. Vera lies that she's gotten pregnant by Sergei, so he obligingly marries her and moves in with her family, which serves only to make matters worse. Vera's drunken father (Yuri Nazarov) ends up stabbing his son-in-law. Persuaded to lie about the incident to keep her father out of jail, Vera takes her family's side. A last-minute tragedy is barely averted, but we get the distinct feeling that Vera's problems with her family in particular and her life in general are far from over [synopsis from <a href="http://allmovie.com/">All-Movie Guide</a>] 110 min. <b>DVD 8369; vhs 999:379</b></dd>

<dt><b>McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller</b> (1971)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Robert Altman. Cast: Warren Beatty, Julie Christie, Rene Auberjonois, Hugh Millais, Shelly Duvall. "What many consider to be Robert Altman's best film is a western, set in some wild, frozen corner of the Northwest Territory, where somehow there exists the shanty town of Presbyterian Church. And an itinerant, bluffing gambler named John McCabe (Warren Beatty). And a professional whore and realist named Mrs. Miller (Julie Christie) with whom McCabe has both a business relationship and something akin to love. And a host of miners and prostitutes whose mumbled reveries and half-expressed movements reflect the tenuousness of life in a precariously built town barely able to protect them from the changing seasons (superbly captured by Vilmos Zsigmond's photography) and politics. It's a western, but an Altman western, filled with Altman humor, Altman moods and Altman absurdities. When McCabe goes out to face the mining company's hired guns, it's morning, not High Noon, and Mrs. Miller, the realist, has already retreated to the sure indifference of the opium pipe"--Pacific Film Archive film note. 121 min. <b>DVD 1275; vhs 999:419</b></dd>

<dt><b>Traffic in Souls</b> (1913)</dt>
<dd>Directed by George Loane Tucker. Cast: Jane Gail, Matt Moore, Ethel Grandin, Fred Turner. Produced when social problem dramas were popular and co-financed by reform groups, this film is set against the white slavery rackets of the 1910s. Purportedly based on findings of "the John D. Rockefeller White Slavery Report and the investigation of the Vice Trust by District Attorney Whitman," the melodrama is skillfully crafted to evoke the feel of "true crime" in the Victorian era, like the pages of the National Police Gazette brought vividly to life. The film was reportedly screened before female immigrants at Ellis Island as a caution to the dangers of the New World. Special DVD feature: Optional audio essay soundtrack by Shelley Stamp ; "The call of the city" / (Harry Beaumont, director) ; music, Rodney Sauer (ca. 12 min.) 90 min. <b>DVD 9992; vhs 999:3608</b></dd>

<dt><b>Deux ou trois choses que je sais d'elle (Two or Three Things I Know About Her)</b> (France, 1966)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Jean-Luc Godard. Cast: Marina Vlady, Anny Duperey, Roger Montsoret, Jean Narboni, Christophe Bourseiller, Joseph Gehrard, Raoul Levy, Yves Beneyton, Juliet Berto, Helena Bielicic, Marie Bourseiller, Robert Chevassu, Blanding Jeanson, Benjamin Jules-Rosette, Jean-Pierre Laverne, Jean-Patrick Lebel, Anna Manga, Claude Miller, Helene Scott. The "her" in the film refers to Paris. Inspired by a real article on housewife prostitution, the film examines Godard's theory that if you lived in Paris (at the time) one had to prostitute oneself to survive. This "sociological fable" is shot through the eyes of Juliette, a housewife who spends one day a week in central Paris selling her body on the street in the hope that she will be able to escape the high rise suburban drudgery in which she lives with her family, and find happiness. Disc set includes book (50 p.) on making of the film. 84 min. <b>DVD 8461; vhs 999:1761</b></dd>

<dt><b>The Devil's Wanton (aka Prison) (F&#228;ngelse)</b> (Sweden, 1949)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Ingmar Bergman. Cast: Birger Malmsten, Doris Svedlund, Hasse Ekman, Eva Henning, Stig Olin. In this early film by Bergman questions about God and life are probed in a story that interweaves the lives of a film director, a poet and his wife, a prostitute and her boyfriend-pimp. Although Bergman convincingly depicts a world in which people are adrift, or drowning in a sea of confusion and despair, the film is almost never depressing and at times is humorous, even exhilarating. 78 min. <b>DVD X4744; vhs 999:2910</b></dd>

A Texas "cowboy" takes a bus to New York in search of lonely, rich women who will pay for his sexual services, but instead spends a hard winter looking after a dying derelict. Vito Russo has commented: When buddy films returned in the late Sixties, the presence onscreen of homosexual characters was a perfect way of saying, 'Oh, no, /this isn't what we mean at all.' Homosexuals drew suspicion away from the buddies--it was yardstick time again." (<i>The Celluloid Closet</i>, p. 80-83) <b>DVD 5254; vhs 999:986</b></dd>

"In this modern restructuring of the 60's road movie, River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves hustle their way through Seattle, Portland, Idaho and Rome on a quest for River's missing mother. With a meticulous lyric style, the film combines sprawling landscapes, scenes of passionless sexuality, and allusions to Orson Welles' <i>Chimes at Midnight</i>as it addresses issues of love, family, politics, and homosexuality."

<dd>Directed by Billy Wilder. Cast: William Holden, Gloria Swanson, Erich von Stroheim. "In Hollywood of the 50's, the obscure screenplay writer Joe Gillis is not able to sell his work to the studios, is full of debts and is thinking in returning to his hometown to work in an office. While trying to escape from his creditors, he has a flat tire and parks his car in a decadent mansion in Sunset Boulevard. He meets the owner and former silent-movie star Norma Desmond, who lives alone wit her butler and driver Max von Mayerling. Norma is demented and believes she will return to the cinema industry, and is protected and isolated from the world by Max, who was his director and husband in the past and still loves her. Norma proposes Joe to move to the mansion and help her in writing a screenplay for her comeback to the cinema, and the small-time writer becomes her lover and gigolo. When Joe falls in love for the young aspirant writer Betty Schaefer, Norma becomes jealous and completely insane and her madness leads to a tragic end."
