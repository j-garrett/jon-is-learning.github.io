<dt><b>After Modernism: The Dilemma of Influence</b></dt>
<dd>The purposeful dismantling of the modernist myth has been the central issue of contemporary art making and art criticism. Since the 1960s, other disciplines, cultures and artists previously excluded from modernism's privileged canons have become absorbed into an ever expanding field of activity and influence. Younger artsts are a new breed of cultural scavengers -- anything is fair game for appropriation or reinterpretation. Here various modernists discuss their art works. 1992. 59 min. <b>Video/C 9102</b></dd>

<dt><b>American Visions</b> Written and narrated by Robert Hughes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br></dt>
<dd>&#149; <b>A Wave From the Atlantic.</b> Waves of immigrants in the early 20th century bring both their old culture and a thirst for the new. The tenements are documented by photographer Jacob Riis and the socially conscious Ashcan School. Then, after the historic 1913 Armory show, artists like Joseph Stella, Paul Strand, Alfred Stieglitz, forge a modernism that is uniquely American. Also presents the work of Robert Henri, George Bellows, Marcel Duchamp, Charles Demuth, Arthur Dove, Georgia O'Keeffe, Mabel Dodge Luhand, Marsden Hartley and Frank Lloyd Wright. <b>Video/C 4779</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>&#149; <b>Streamlines and Breadlines.</b> Examines the mythic images of the 1920's and 30's as skyscrapers rise in New York and the rural heartland is idealized by Regionalists like Thomas Hart. Artists of the WPA celebrate the worker as hero, while Jacob Lawrence tells stories of black America, and ambitious New Deal projects like Hoover Dam project self-confidence in hard times. Also examines the work of Raymond Hood, Edward Hopper, Stuart Davis, and Grant Wood. <b>Video/C 4780</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>&#149; <b>The Empire of Signs.</b> After the post-war era, Hughes traces the development of abstract expressionism and the life of Jackson Pollock, and explores how artists as different as James Rosenquist, Claes Oldenburg, Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman, David Smith, Willem De Kooning, Robert Rauschenberg, Romare Bearden, Joseph Cornell, Andy Warhol and Jasper Johns reacted to the new consumer culture. <b>Video/C 4781</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>&#149; <b>The Age of Anxiety.</b> This final segment explores how American art has reflected the upheavals of the last 25 years. Hughes traces the evolution of abstract art and minimalism and considers the spiritual richness of earth works, in which nature is the artist's medium. He ends the series by profiling a wide range of contemporary artists including Edward Kienholz, Donald Judd, Richard Serra, Walter De Maria, Robert Smithson, Bruce Nauman, Richard Diebenkorn, Philip Guston, Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons, Susan Rothenberg, Eric Fischl, Louise Bourgeois and James Turrell. <b>Video/C 4782</b></dd>

Centered around a walk-through of the show with its curators Kirk Varnedoe and Adam Gopnik, the film explores the question of the fate of avant-garde art in mass cuture.c1991. 31 min. <b>Video/C 9104</b></dd>

Long before home video there flourished an alternative cinema culture on college campuses and around art theaters, where foreign film fare was often accompanied by a short subject. As reliable 16mm film equipment became available to non-professionals, artists independent of film centers began experimenting with cinema. Serious film societies sprang up in New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, holding semi-private screenings of non-commercial artistic films. This collection is of mainly American pictures, principally one-man artistic endeavors made from little more than an artist's desire to express feelings with a camera. 289 min. DVD X2382</dd>

One man, the night watchman on the Eiffel tower, finds himself the only one awake in Paris. Everyone else has been frozen in time by a mysterious ray invented by a mad scientist.

<dt><b>Entr'acte.</b> (France, 1923)</dt>
<dd>"Two men approach a canon and fire it. Rifle-range dummies sway in the wind. A dancing ballerina turns into a strange bearded man. Two men on a roof-top terrace play a game of chess. A funeral procession, moving in slow motion, follows a coffin pulled by a camel. What can it all mean...? This extraordinary early film from director Ren&eacute; Clair was originally made to fill an interval between two acts of Francis Picabia's new ballet, Rel&acirc;che, at the Theatre des Champs-Elyse&eacute;s in Paris in 1924. Picabia famously wrote a synopsis for the film on one sheet of note paper, headed Maxim's (the famous Parisian restaurant), which he sent to Ren&eacute; Clair. This formed the basis for what ultimately appeared on screen, with some additional improvisations. Music for the film was composed by the famous avant-garde composer Erik Satie, who appears in the film, along side its originator, Francis Picabia. The surrealist photographer Man Ray also puts in an appearance, in a film which curiously resembles his own experimental films of this era. Entr'acte is a surrealistic concoction of unrelated images, reflecting Clair's interest in Dada, a fashionable radical approach to visual art which relied on experimentation and surreal expressionism. Clair's imagery is both captivating and disturbing, giving life to inanimate objects (most notably the rifle range dummies), whilst attacking conventions, even the sobriety of a funeral march. When the first performance of Rel&acirc;che was cancelled because of the ill-health of one of is stars, the public were outraged. There was a belief that Picabia had staged the ultimate Dada stunt - the title of the show means "respite" in French. The controversy was laid to rest when the show opened, a few days later than planned. For its part, Clair's Entr'acte won widespread praise, although the response from the paying public was divided. As to what the film actually means, well that's anyone's guess. Like all good surrealist art there are an infinite number of possible interpretations, and one's appreciation and understanding of this film is very much a subjective experience. Themes which appear to dominate the work are death, mortality and the hastening pace of technology. Hence, one possible interpretation is that the film is mocking mankind's attempts to cope with the brevity of his existence. As progress is made, man has to run faster and faster to cram more and more into a fixed duration, his limited lifespan. Could the Entr'acte of the film's title represent that short period of what we call "life", that too brief an interval between two acts of an eternal duration?" [Jim Travers.

<dt><b>Celles qui s'en font</b> (France, 1928)</dt>
<dd>"This short film by Germaine Dulac is a mystery: generally the date given is 1928, but many historians simply forget to even mention the film at all... Now the mystery can be lifted, since it was released as part of a French DVD(Retour de flamme, by Serge Bromberg's Lobster films) compiling restored shorts and cartoons, and transferred complete with the authentic original musical accompaniment, revealing that the film was in fact intended as an illustration of a song(The title of the film), which was in fact 3 minutes long, and which was recorded in 1930, which is obviously the accurate date for the film as well. It is, as usual with Mrs Dulac, highly impressionistic, whatever that means. Consider it as an early clip, in a gloomy, Frenchly poetic style."

<dt><b>Ballet M&eacute;chanique.</b>(France, 1924)</dt>
<dd>A classic reference point for abstract cinema, co-made by cubist painet L&eacute;ger and Dudley Murphy. Stephen Dwoskin, in his book Film Is, describes the film as follows: The film takes what often seem to be chance elements of objective images and juxtaposes them in rhythmic movements. The editing is the essence, involving as it does an infatuation and exploration of the time/movement possibilities of the film. Here is an early example of physical potential being used, the structure being built up from the image content. The repetition of a woman climbing stairs, or the spinning of wheels as a close-up, gives a sense of freedom to the visual motion inherent in the subjects. [Michael J. Sicinski, UCB Film Studies Program]. <b>DVD 4095; DVD 4191; vhs 999:108</b></dd>

Except for one of the words, it's pretty easy to solve - though kids might find it challenging. The film is about 15 minutes long and is quite snazzy - lots of camera movement, overlays, animation, all combined together - Leni pulls out all the stops and haves fun in the process."

<dt><b>Man Ray: Prophet of the Avant-garde</b></dt>
<dd>Man Ray is the quintessential modernist figure: photographer, painter, object maker and collagist, filmmaker and printmaker, poet, essayist and philosopher. Born Emanuel Radnitsky in 1890, he went on to become the leader of the "American avant-garde" and the most enigmatic of the Dada-Surrealists who transformed the Paris art world during the ferment of the 1920's and beyond. This profile follows the creative genius from his youth in Brooklyn to his glory days in Paris and, finally, to his impact on future generations of artists in a variety of fields. Also includes a never-before-seen interview with Man Ray in which he reminisces about his life and work. Based on the book: Man Ray: American artist / Neil Baldwin (Art/Classics N6537.R3.B31 1988 Room 308G; Main Stack N6537.R3.B3 1988)Originally presented as a segment on the PBS television program American masters in 1997. 56 min. <b>DVD 689</b></dd>

<dt><b>Hans Richter: Early Avant-Garde Films</b></dt>
<dd>"Richter on Film" (1972, 14 mins.) is an interview with Hans Richter at age 83 in his Connecticut home, talking about his early experimental films and their relationship to this paintings, scrolls and collages. The pioneer work "Rhythm 21" ("Rhythmus 21" 1921-4)[also on DVD 4191]orchestrates the squares and rectangles of the film screen, while "Rhythm 23" ("Rhythmus 23", 1923, 3 mins., silent) features criss-cross patterns, negative reversals, intercut stringed forms, and further variations of the rectangle and square.

<dt><b>Berlin: Die Sinfonie der Gro&szlig;tadt (Berlin: Symphonie of a Great City)</b> (Germany, 1927)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Walter (Walther) Ruttmann. A cross section of life in Berlin from dawn to midnight on a late spring day. Uses montage, cutting, and editing to capture the pulse and tempo of this city. An early example of 'impressionistic' documentaries created in 1927. "With Berlin, die Sinfonie der Gro&szlig;tadt, Walther Ruttmann directed the landmark film of the 1920s symphonic cityscapes. [Special feature] Melodie der Welt is the first German sound feature. DVD X759: This 2-disc set presents both these classics in newly restored versions and adds all the surviving short films he directed between 1921 and 1931. Ruttmann's innovative experimentations in movement, color and sound confirm his status as a pioneer of modern media art. Notes from DVD X6467 edition: Walther Ruttmann is a pioneer of modern multimaedia art. This DVD combines for the first time all surviving works by Ruttmann from 1920-1931 in newly restored and reconstructed versions, often with original scores. His first short films are unique experiments with forms, colors, and rhythm, his innovative commercials connected abstract animation art with concrete messages. The symphonic documentary Berlin, die Sinfonie der Grosstadt is one of the most famous silent cassics, the travelogue Melodie der Welt became the first German sound feature film. With the radio play Weekend Ruttmann created the first "sound film without images" while his short In der Nacht transforms music to images and is a prototype of modern music videos. <b>DVD X6467:</b> Disc 1: Berlin - die Sinfonie der Gro&szlig;tadt (si., 1927, 65 min.) -- Lichtspiel Opus 1 (1921) -- Opus 2 (1922) -- Opus 3 (1924) -- Opus 4 (1925) -- Der Sieger (1922) -- Das Wunder (1922) -- Das Wiedergefundene Paradies (1925) -- Der Aufstieg (1926) -- Spiel der Wellen (1926) -- Dort wo der Rhein / paintings and drawings by Walther Ruttmann 1911-1920 (1927).

A CIA film called "Burial at Sea"--Recorded in 1974 but unacknowledged until 1992 - documents the burial at sea of six Soviet sailors, in a ceremony which collapses Cold War antagonisms in a moment of death and honor. Images pertaining to a publicly acknowledged but top secret U.S. missile strike in Yemen in 2002 are the source of a concluding reflection on the role of documents in the constitution of the dynamic of knowing and not knowing. "Interviews conducted in July 2000 with Ed Cohen (Office of Information Management, CIA), Steven Garfinkel (Information Security Oversight Office), and Lee Strickland (Information Review Group, CIA)."

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>&#149; <b>Program 1, Explorations of Presence, Performance and Audience.</b></dd>
<dd>The artists included here moved into video from performance, sculpture, photography, writing and dance. They used the video camera as a mirror, a tool to investigate perception, presenting performative strategies within the paradocically intimate and distanced theater of the video monitor. In most pieces the performer constructs an active relationship with the audience, and the viewer's awareness is specifically acknowledged.</dd>

<dd>&#149; <b>Program 2, Investigations of the Phenomenal World -- Space, Sound, and Light.</b></dd>
<dd>In this anthology, the body of the artist functions as one kind of instrument in the presence of, or complicated by, the video and audio recording instruments. Issues of attention such as boredom and exhaustion of both the artist and the audience, are embraced as part of the potential dynamic range of the work. Some of the video projects also propose structural relationships between natural or biological and electronic systems.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>&#149; <b>Program 3, Approaching Narrative --"There are problems to be solved."</b></dd>
<dd>The works here establish inventive formal staging for epic story-telling. These projects have no interest in seducing an audience into accepting a seamless narrative illusion of reality. Instead, problems are constructed around an audience's understanding of the real and construction of their attention. Audiences have to work to derive meaning from presentations that seek to rupture expectations and also challenge public storytelling and seek to decentralize cultural mythmaking by inventing new forms of theatrical space.</dd>

<dd>&#149; <b>Program 4, Gendered Confrontations.</b></dd>
<dd>These feminist video works challenge the reigning but waning modernist and materials-based discourse of the '70s, as well as psychoanalytic theory and the construction of the subject. Video is used to examine one's own life and the experiences of female friends and family, and to question one's own relationship to "her"/history. As histories of women in the arts and in society are explored, critical attention is also focused onto speculation about the existence of an essential female aesthetic, and the position of women as objects of the (male) gaze.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>&#149; <b>Program 5, Performance of Video Imaging Tools</b></dd>
<dd>In these video pieces artists explore video as an electronic material, and they are interested in the process of translating energy and time into waveforms, frequencies, voltages, and finally into video and audio images. The pieces presented here are documents of dialogues with tools or real-time performances of tools where a video signal is routed through an interface of modifiable electronic instruments.</dd>

<dd>&#149; <b>Program 6, Decentralized Communications Projects.</b></dd>
<dd>Generated by artists, public access cable producers, and video collectives, this video anthology marks the efforts of cultural activists to redefine the asymmetrical relationship between transmission and reception, the production and consumption of American television. The introduction of the portapak in the politically-charged late '60s inspired proposals for a radically decentralized information system. By the mid-70's there existed a burgeoning alternative media network of public access cable channels, media art centers, public television stations and a range of independent venues that included pirate TV, media laboratories, and library video programs.</dd>

<dd>&#149; <b>Program 7, Critiques of Art and Media as Commodity and Spectacle.</b></dd>
<dd>Through projects that are oppositional to both the economic and attentional structures of broadcast TV, artists target the nature of its spectacle, spellout critical manifestoes, undermine the selection of newsworthy events and public storytelling, and challenge consumers' investment in televisions' cast of heroes and occasional heroines. In these seven films artists re-present television and film images in an effort to reframe them and reconstruct the ideological context that constructs meaning for television viewers.</dd>

<dd>This final segment illustrates how early documentary producers in the 1970's worked to establish relationships with broadcast television that would deliver their independently conceived and produced television to large broadcast audiences. Some saw their challenging projects co-opted by broadcasters, who appropriated independent eye-witnessing as stylistic inventions for television news and dramatic programs.

<dd>A video performance by Acconci, which illustrates his unique engagement of conceptual art, performance and Body Art.

Blindfolded, with ears plugged, two men try to sense each other's movements to assume the same motion and bearing. An off-screen voice, heard only by the audience, gives directions that would help them attain their goal.

<dd>The film was made by Acconci's using the video monitor as a mirror. As we look at the artist sighting along his outstretched arm and forefinger toward the center of the screen what we see is a sustained tautology: a line of sight that begins at Acconci's plane of vision and ends at the eyes of his projected double. The result turns the activity around: a pointing away from the filmaker at an outside viewer.

In Parts II and III, Acconci continues to play with gender illusions via manipulations of his own body parts.

<dt><b>Face-off.</b></dt>
<dd>This film is an ironic collusion of private and public, of exposure and masking, a tense ritual wherein Acconci divulges and then censors his self-revelations. He turns on an audiotape of his own voice addressing himself and the viewer, recounting intimate details about his life. Whenever the material becomes too personal however, he tries to drown out his voice and prevent the viewer from hearing yelling "No, no, no, don't tell this!" He becomes increasingly agitated as the tape proceedes. (Purchased with Stuart and Gail Buchalter Fund for the Study of Contemporary Art) 32 min. <b>Video/C 5243</b></dd>

<dt><b>Fresh Acconci.</b></dt>
<dd>Artists Paul McCarthy and Mike Kelley re-stage classic 1970s performance pieces by Vito Acconci, with a decidedly ironic Southern California sensibility. Based on videotapes by Vito Acconci: "Claim excerpts" (1971), "Contacts" (1971), "Focal point" (1971), "Pryings" (1971), and "Theme song" (1973). Originally produced in 1995. 45 min. <b>DVD 5365</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><b>Pryings.</b></dt>
<dd>This documentation of a live performance at New York University, is a graphic exploration of the physical and psychological dynamics of male/female interaction, a study in control, violation and resistance. The camera focuses tightly on Kathy Dillon's face, as Acconci tries to pry open her closed eyes. Her body is a vehicle for a literal enactment of the desire for and resistance against intimate contact.

Ericka Beckman, Ilona Granet, Richie O'Halloran, Kathy Rusch, David Salle, Michael Zwack. Considered to be Acconci's master work, this three-part epic is one of the major achievements in the video medium. Designed originally for video projection, the work is structured to merge video space--the close-up--with filmic space--the landscape. Acconci maps a topography of the self within a cultural and social context, locating personal identity through history, cultural artifacts, language and representation.

<dt><b>Eija-Liisa Ahtila: The Cinematic Works</b></dt>
<dd>Eija-liisa Ahtila's films and cinematic installations experiment with storytelling creating extraordinary tales out of ordinary human experiences. These five films deal with separations, teenage girls' sexuality, relationships among family members, mental disintegration, and death. They investigate the processes of perception and the attribution of meaning, while the installations break down the story and divide it across the exhibition space. The stories are based on interviews and research, the results being transformed into material for the imagination during the scriptwriting process. Seemlessly incorporated into realistic settings using special cinematic techniques, these events give Ahtila's films their distinctive style.

<dt><b>Peggy Ahwesh Compilation.</b></dt>
<dd>From Romance to Ritual (21 min.) -- I Ride a Pony Named Flame (5 min.) -- Martina's Playhouse (20 min.). Three films by Ahwesh, considerably different in style. In From Ritual to Romance, seemingly straightforward vacation movies soon reveal strained interpersonal relationships. In I Ride a Pony Named Flame, performer Margie Strosser assumes a number of disconcerting feminine guises, each branded with a pejorative label which may be ironic. Martina's Playhouse confronts the mostly male-coded tradition of avant-garde home moviemaking. In this psychologically challenging work, mother and young daughter trade places in a fraught dialectic of power and dependency. In between, adult women discuss their sexual desires, their discourse bolstered or thwarted (depending on your outlook) by recitations from Lacan. [Michael J.

<dt><b>Pistolary!: Films and Videos by Peggy Ahwesh</b> <b>DVD 6555</b><br></dt>
<dd>&#149;Disc I: Scary movie / with Martina Torr, Sonja Mereu (1993, 9 min.) -- She puppet (2001, 17 min.) -- Martina's playhouse / with Martina Torr, Jennifer Montgomery (1989, 20 min.) -- Star eaters / with Jackie Smith, Alex Auder, Ricardo Dominguez (2003, 24 min.) Scary movie: Two girls personalize the horror genre with a plot and shot-by-shot structure of their own design, reveling in their ability to reproduce the tropes of horror while, at the same time, taking control of its meaning. She puppet: Lara Croft, the virtual girl-doll of the late 20th century, is recast as a triad of her personas: the alien, the orphan, and the clone in this work based on appropriated footage from the game Tomb Raider. Martina's playhouse: The little girl of the title oscillates from narrator to reader to performer and from the role of baby to that of mother. Star eaters: In this treatise on women and gambling, the allure of risk-taking, the contradictions of excessive behavior, and a penchant for failure combine in a fairy-tale set in the abandoned decay that once was Atlantic City.</dd>

<dd>&#149;Disc II: Deadman / Peggy Ahwesh in collaboraion with Keith Sanborn (1990, 37 min.) -- Nocturne / Peggy Ahwesh (1998, 30 min.) Deadman: "Charting the adventures of a near-naked heroine who sets in motion a scabrous free-form orgy before returning to the house to die, this film combines elegance, raunchy defilement and barbaric splendor." Nocturne: "The woman has perhaps murdered her lover and is living in an unstable world when he returns to her at night, in her dreams and into her arms, as witness to the subversive violence of nature, corporeality and desire."</dd>

<dd>&#149;Disc III: Strange weather / Peggy Ahwesh in collaboraion with Margie Strosser (1993, 50 min.) -- 73 suspect words &amp; Heaven's gate / Peggy Ahwesh (2001-02, 8 min.) -- Vision machine / Strange weather: A quartet of crack addicts, absorbed by their life of pure sensation, are holed up inside while the world outside is about to explode. Shot in pixelvision, Peggy Ahwesh's tainted soap opera is by visual definition a small world in which minute details are rendered large, with the character's surroundings having prominence but no meaning. 73 suspect words &amp; Heaven's gate: Two text videos from a series that distills to a poetic and symbolic core, a variety of texts, source code, search results, and/or coded messages from the unruly databases that glut the Net. Vision machine: The spinning disks of Duchamp and the sex jokes of Bu~nuel collide in this essay about the feminine speaking subject, her wit, and its relation to her unconscious.</dd>

<dt><b>Scary Movie</b>(1993)</dt>
<dd>A "collaboration with Martina Torr, who by the time the film was shot, was some years older than she was in Martina's Playhouse. Shot in wonderfully high contrast black and white with very low key lighting, the film is one of Ahwesh's most beautiful and most light-hearted; it is also the most reflexive of her many nods towards the horror genre. The film features Martina and co-star/playmate Sonja Mereu. While Martina is costumed in cheap girls' dress up clothes, Sonja has a fake moustache, black gloves and prosthetic monster fingers. The first shot is a repetitive and jerky hand-held pan of a hand drawn music score while the sounds of Psycho-like violins play on the soundtrack. So begins what might be called an anatomising re-reading of the horror genre. The entire soundtrack is a pastiche of music and sounds native to the horror film &iuml;&iquest;&frac12; screams, strings, squeaking doors, footsteps, etc &iuml;&iquest;&frac12; although with a few corny phrases and sound effects that sound as though they've been lifted from a Warner Brothers cartoon. At various points a prosthetic rubber hand (obviously manipulated by a human extending from offscreen space) reaches mock-eerily to caress Martina who pretends to be asleep. Sonja probes/assaults Martina with kitchen tongs and later stabs her repeatedly with a tin-foil knife, and in turn is stabbed by the rubber hand wielding a similar weapon. In the middle of the film's duration, Sonja holds up a poster announcing the credits (she is credited as the 'Doctor/Killer', Martina as the 'Patient/Hand Lover'). Then we see the girls screaming, then dancing. They seem to have escaped their outing into the horror genre. The film ends."

<dt><b>The Vision Machine.</b></dt>
<dd>"Here Ahwesh's heterogeneous textual approach comes to the fore, as she juxtaposes narrative, faux documentary, comedic and 'serious' footage, and merges film, video, and Pixelvision. Suggestions and meanings accumulate: austere, theoretical text is interrupted by shots of women relating bawdy (sexist) jokes; classic R&amp;B music plays while women stomp on records and pour alcohol on the floor. The vision machine is a fragmented inquiry into issues of gender, language and representation." Originally produced in 1996.

<p>In <i>Fireworks</i> a dissatisfied dreamer awakes, goes out in the night seeking a light and is drawn through the needle's eye to return less empty than before. <i>Puce Moment</i> reflects Anger's concerns with the myths and decline of Hollywood. <i>Rabbitt's Moon</i> is a fable of the unattainable (the Moon) combining elements of Commedia dell'Arte with Japanese myth. <i>Eaux d'Artifice</i> portrays hide and seek in a night-time labyrinth of levels, cascades, balustraces, grottoes and fountains. <i>Kustom Kar Kommandos</i> is a voyeuristic look at a tight-jeaned man polishing his car. Anger's short films represent a vision of "repressed homosexual desires, twarted in real life and painfully exorcized onscreen. Anger, a highschool student who had grown up on Hollywood's sanitized images, filled <i>Fireworks</i> with his hidden fantasies, complete with the bald sexuality inherent in the images of cowboys, test pilots and, in this case, sailors, images that dominated the dreams of millions."

These short films by Austria's Martin Arnold take brief passages from classic Hollywood cinema (respectively, the films recycle scenes from The Human Jungle and To Kill a Mockingbird), subjecting them to an optical printing process which infuses these banal excerpts with an incessant "stutter." Both image and sync sound skip back and forth, creating a staccato rhythm which Arnold himself likens to turntable scratching in hip-hop. By prolonging filmic moments which ordinarily pass in a few seconds, Arnold's films reveal both the abstract choreography and, even more interestingly, the gender coding and politics which lay hidden within the most subtle, least unremarkable gestures.

<dd>Directed by Antony Balch. Cast: Richard Shulman, Janet Spearman, Dorothy Grumbar, Anthony Rowlands, Valentine Dyall. "A brainy sex flick with a sense of humor, the film begins with a narrator/mummy who guides us through a number of vignettes promising to show what some of us go through in the pursuit of sexual pleasure.

The only way to save humanity is to uncover a secret lodged in an old episode of the 1950s series Science in Action.

<dd>In this pseudo documentary, every disaster, man-made or natural, every assassination, and every period of political turmoil, past, present and future, is attributed to the work of aliens (the Quetzals) living beneath the earth's crust. Disturbed by 1950s American atomic testing, the aliens strike back at the USA in such varied schemes as the replicant Castro, the psychic vampire regime in Grenada and the Allende plot to alter the Earth's axis. Only covert action by the CIA can stop the dreaded Quetzals. <b>DVD 6618</b></dd>

<dt><b>Battle Ship Potemkin Dance Edit (120 BPM)</b></dt>
<dd>Bell-Smith refers to his re-edit of Eisenstein's iconic 1925 film The Battleship Potemkin as a "sort of Cliff Notes condensation of the original narrative." Writes the artist, "I've separated the film into its constituent shots and time stretched them one by one to the exact same length, one half of a second. I then replaced the soundtrack with a one-second dance loop synced to the cuts." Through his reconfiguration, Bell-Smith replaces the editing structure of the original film (seminal in its use of montage) with the "dumb, visceral, metric montage favored by dance visuals and music videos" offering up a new context for the film's stark imagery and revolutionary narrative. 2007. 13 min. <b>DVD X4562</b></dd>

<dt><b>Anticipation of the Night.</b></dt>
<dd>One of Brakhage's longest early films, it combines heavily abstracted imagery with an apparent "narrative" premise. At the beginning and end of the film, a male figure seen only in shadow, with whom the camera is identified, hangs himself. In the thirty minutes these scenes enframe, we see what in a more traditional feature might be understood as "life flashing before the eyes." In this case, however, we more properly witness light flashing before our eyes. Portions of clear imagery emerge -- runs through the woods, low angle views of car trips, nights at the fair -- but the overall impression is one of childhood memory and its prelapsarian state of "untutored vision" .

<dd>These highly gestural films were shot in Regular 8mm, later transferred to 16mm. Brakhage, in the Canyon Cinema Catalog 7, describes the films as follows: "Portrait of a lady; fire and a mind's movement in remembering; three girls playing with a ball (hand painted); a childbirth song; the painted veil via moth-death; San Francisco; sea creatures; wedding source and substance; sitting around fires, windows, an insect, a lyre of rain scratches; verticals and shadows caught in glass traps; a travel song of scenes and horizontals; molds, paints and crystals."

<dd>Contents: Part I (1966/1978. col., si., 44 min.) -- Part II (1966/1978, col, si., 41 min.). The furthest that Brakhage came in extending the language of 8mm cinema was his editing of the 23rd Psalm Branch. The phenomenal and painstaking craftsmanship of this film reflects the intensity of the obsession with which its theme grasped his mind. In 1966, out of confusion about the Vietnam War and the American reaction to it, Brakhage began to meditate on the nature of war ... This fruit of his thoughts was the longest and most important of the Songs, an apocalypse of the imagination. 96 min. <b>vhs 999:2271</b></dd>

<h3>&#149;Sophie Calle and Greg Shephard</h3>
<dl>
<dt><b>Double-blind</b></dt>
<dd>"In her premiere video project, French conceptual artist Sophie Calle joins with Gregory Shephard to create a voyeuristic tour de force. Armed with camcorders, Calle and her collaborator/partner Shephard head West in his Cadillac convertible to produce and document a real-life narrative of their journey and their relationship. With America as the backdrop for this unconventional coast-to-coast road movie, Calle and Shephard each narrates and records a personal diary, presenting strikingly different versions of the narrative/relationship. Aiming their dueling camcorders, the protagonists chronicle the elusive landscapes of human relations, wrestling to reconcile self, sexuality, and desire. The viewer is challenged to reconsider the subjective and cultural roles imposed by gender, sexuality, power, and tradition. Throughout, Calle seeks to redefine through personal investigation the terms and parameters of subject/object, public/private, truth, fiction, and role-playing. The quasi-documentary style evokes the films of Chris Marker, to whom Double-Blind is dedicated."

<dt><b>Three Transitions</b></dt>
<dd>In three short exercises, Campus uses basic techniques of video technology and his own image to create succinct, almost philosophical metaphors for the psychology of the self. In the first "transition," he appears to stab himself in the back, climb through the rupture in his body, and emerge whole on the other side. In the second execise, Campus wipes his face with his hand and "erases" its surface--only to reveal another image of his face underneath. Finally in conclusion, he appears to burn the living image of his face (as if it were a photograph), leaving only blackness. 5 min. <b>Video/C 5153</b></dd>

<dt><b>Standish Lawder &amp; Stanley Cavell</b></dt>
<dd>A professor of art history and film, a photographer and an inventor, Standish Lawder made truly experimental films by seeing what a predetermined idea about content, structure, or technique will produce when carried out in shooting or printing. Stanley Cavell, philosopher and professor at Harvard, had just published The World Viewed, his first book on film. In this January 1973 episode of Screening Room, Lawder demonstrates the intricacies of his home-made optical printer and shows examples of what can be achieved with rephotographing film. Gardner, Lawder, and Cavell also discuss the intellectual and psychological implications of his manipulations. Their frank commentary carries on over Lawder's test print of Intolerance, which he had just received from the lab and had not yet viewed it himself. Lawder also screens Necrology, Color Film, and Corridor. 1973. 74 min. <b>DVD 5880</b></dd>

<dd>Director, Philomene Long. Performers: Aya, <b>Shirley Clarke</b>, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Allen Ginsberg, Jack Hirschman, Stuart Z. Perkoff, Frank T. Rios, Viva, Andy Warhol. A film that captures the magic of the Beat generation and their continuing legacy expands into a larger discussion of what it meant to be a poet in America when the ignoble spirit of McCarthyism was loose in the land. From Venice to North Beach to Greenwich Village, the Beats found answers in Buddhism, friendship, and the power of their words. Using an emotional tone which is exactly right and a lovely style of filmic poetry, the beats are immortalized here with heart and soul. 40 min. <b>Video/C 4674</b></dd>

<p>Crossroads: Conner presents the first underwater Atomic Bomb test at Bikini Atoll on July 25, 1946 as both fact and symbol of our age. The atomic detonation in the center of 90 Japanese and U.S. warships is seen as an event in itself, as theater, as sculpture. Looking for mushrooms: A dream of searching for magic mushrooms filmed in San Pedro Tenancingo, Mexico and San Francisco. Thousands of single-frame shots are combined with multiple exposures to create an array of semi-abstract images. An experimental tour-de-force edited in camera. <b>DVD 3995</b></p>

<dd>Shot in four days in 1983 at Playboy's photography studio in Munich, the film begins with the building of the set and follows through to the dismantling of the set at the end of the job. Farocki includes all phases of the photo shoot and shows the participation of the many people involved in making one photo. Though the Playboy photographer instructs the model to "give us your usual saucy look", Farocki strips the glamour and allure from the subject by focusing on the labor and orchestration behind it. 25 min. <b>DVD 6010</b></dd>

<dt><b>How to Live in the FRG (Leben BRD)</b></dt>
<dd>A film by Harun Farocki. Farocki's amazing dissection of modern life in Germany-- in a country he calls "a training camp in which techniques for living are practiced by the professionally living." Composed entirely of 32 short scenes taken from instructional and training classes, these films, sometimes hilarious, and at times ominous, show rehearsals of real life situations acted out in practice sessions for dealing with life in modern day Germany. 1990. 83 min. <b>Video/C 6635</b></dd>

<dt><b>I Thought I Was Seeing Convicts</b></dt>
<dd>An inquiry into means of surveillance and control at Corcoran State Prison, California. We see how the camera suddenly zooms in on a fight between two prisoners. The guard warns the prisoners through speakers, and then fires rubber bullets. When the fight continues they fire live ammunition. By placing the camera next to the rifleman Farocki emphasises the social relationship between the one who fires and the one who films; between the one with force and the one who takes shots. Because of this the images present a very oppressive and critical character. 2000. 25 min. <b>DVD X222</b></dd>

A look at the new control technologies, at personal identification devices, electronic ankle bracelets, and electronic tracking devices. ... These images are unedited and monotonous; as neither time nor space is compressed, they are particularly well-suited to conveying the state of inactivity into which prisoners are placed as a punitive measure. The surveillance cameras show the norm and reckon with deviations from it. 1993. 60 min. <b>DVD 9981</b></dd>

<dt><b>Bartos Family: The Father and His Three Sons</b></dt>
<dd>Having carefully collected home movies, from the early 20th century through the thirties and forties, Forgacs renders a lyrical portrait of the Bartos family in Budapest, Hungary. The small rituals and events of this bourgeois family provide a view of the bridging of an age and culture, creating a mirror that reflects the face of private and official history. The Hungarian Quisling government looted the rich family and WWII and later Communism eventually completely destroyed their wealth. 1988 60 min. <b>DVD 3201</b></dd>

Between 1921 and 1948 as one of Hungary's most influential clergymen, his archconservative personality and controversial ambivalence toward Jews left its mark on the history of the Hungarian Holocaust. Now he walks in his garden amongst the strands of his memories.... 2002. 57 min. <b>DVD 3211</b></dd>

<dd>Having carefully collected home movies filmed in Hungary, particularly from the thirties and forties, Forgacs explores the historical and the cultural via the private. In Bourgeois dictionary he examines the tragic fate of those who lie at the silent heart of books and films produced in the post-communist moment. "I wanted neither to be sentimental, nor to construct worlds only of those under repression and segregation. I don't know how I would behave in such circumstances .. the account is there, you have to face it ... I wanted the audience to be hurt, too." 1992. 49 min. <b>DVD 3204</b></dd>

<dt><b>The Danube Exodus: Two Danube Stories Filmed by Captain Andrasovits</b></dt>
<dd>Found footage pioneer Peter Forgacs combines music, newsreel images and narration from private diaries with extraordinary footage taken by the captain of a Danube cruise ship between 1938 and 1945. An intimate gripping journey into the world of refugees displace by war, Captain Andrasovits filmed Slovakian Jews desperate to escape the coming conflagration, travelling by way of the Danube River to the Black Sea and beyond, to Palestine. As the war continues he begins to ferry other refugees: Bessarabian Germans expelled by the Russians in 1940. Their evacuation and resettlement in Poland as WWII progresses is a haunting counterpoint to the fate of the Jewish refugees. 1998. 60 min. <b>DVD 3213</b></dd>

<dt><b>Dusi and Jen~o</b></dt>
<dd>Originally shot between 1936 and 1966 by Jen~o, a banker living in Budapest, the film shootings are of he and his wife and dog but it also presents the City of Budapest itself, in snow, fog and rain, with photography of sensual accuracy. In the midst of this peaceful landscape, Nazi troops, bombardments, flechees Crosses, and Jewish work camps cross the images of Jen~o. This film is a poem, which sets up a breathtaking memorial to the vanishing representatives of the Hungarian middle class. 1989. 45 min. <b>DVD 3202</b></dd>

<dt><b>Either - Or</b></dt>
<dd>Having carefully collected home movies, particularly from the thirties and forties, Forgacs renders lyrical portraits of bourgeois families, mostly from Budapest.

<dt><b>Free Fall</b></dt>
<dd>Beginning in 1938 through home movies taken by musician and businessman Gyorgy Pet~o, shows how this Hungarian Jewish family from the city of Szeged, suppressed the fearful signs of threatening evidences of forthcoming massacre. As the illusions of this Jewish Hungarian family are eroded step-by-step, their happy, banal moments are framed against a recitation of anti-Jewish laws in Hungary during the Nazi era and descriptions of the deportation of Hungarian Jews. 1996. 75 min. <b>DVD 3207</b></dd>

<dt><b>Kadar's Kiss</b></dt>
<dd>Gleaned from found footage and home movies and assembled by Peter Forgacs, this film presents an exploration of the terrain of "everyday erotics" during the post-WWII Communist regime in Hungary. Intercut with radio addresses by First Secretary Janos Kadar, speaking against individualsm and preaching the birth of a New Man and the advent of the socialist egalitarian era, its double speak and shameless ideological political perversion contradicts the everyday life behind the doors of private homes as Forgacs ironically explores this chapter of official and private histories. 1998. 45 min. <b>DVD 3209</b></dd>

<dt><b>The Land of Nothing</b></dt>
<dd>An amateur film journal sometimes contradicts the "official," so called "public history" from a private history view. During WWII, Ensign Laszlo Ratz of the Second Hungarian Army infantry, shot family films from 1938. His war film story begins with entrainment in June 1942, and follows through the long Ukrainian march of the Second Hungarian Army. On the roadside Ukraine people stare into the camera. Later it covers the devastating final clash with the Soviets at the Bloody Voronhez front. Ratz filmed until the eve of the catastrophe of the Hungarian Army at the river Don. 1996. 62 min. <b>DVD 3206</b></dd>

<dt><b>The Maelstrom: A Family Chronicle</b></dt>
<dd>Makes artful use of home movies shot in the Netherlands before and during WWII dealing with the extended Peereboom family. Information is conveyed through English subtitles and period sound, usually from radio broadcasts and a disturbing jazz score by Tibor Szemz~o. What we see is a Jewish family first living unknowingly in the shadow of the Holocaust and then trying to cope with it still unaware of what it will finally mean. Shots of the family cheerfully sewing and doing preparations for a trip to a "work camp," when their destination is in reality Auschwitz, adds a devastating dimension to the understanding of Hitler's "final solution." 1997. 60 min. <b>DVD 3215</b></dd>

<dd>Consists entirely of archival footage of family home movies and celebrations filmed in Europe during WWII juxtaposed with the grimmer realities of the war, offering visible evidence of the private aspects of WWII. The increasing persecution of the Jews and footage of concentration camps are included. A recurring event is the public racist punishment of two young lovers, an 18-yr. old German boy and a Polish girl, who are bound and humiliated, their hair shaved off and burnt as a National Socialist performance lesson to the children of a German-Polish village. 1994. 52 min. <b>DVD 3212</b></dd>

<dt><b>Miss Universe 1929: Lisl Goldarbeiter, A Queen in Wien</b></dt>
<dd>Amateur filmmaker Marci Tanzer began to photograph and film his beautiful cousin Lisl when he moved to Vienna from Szeged in the late 1920s. In 1929 she won the title of Miss Austria and later was voted the first Miss Universe. Her privileged life as a beauty queen and later a rich wife ended with the Nazi takeover of Austria, but the two of them eventually married.</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Lisl Goldarbeiter and Marci Tenczer -born in 1908- were cousins and knew each other since early childhood. The Goldarbeiters lived in Vienna and belonged to the Austrian wing of a large Austro-Hungarian Jewish family. The Tenczer's lived in Szeged, and formed the Hungarian wing. The family ties between Vienna and Szeged never ceased. Marci moved to Vienna in 1926, to study. The first anti-Semitic law in Europe, the Hungarian Numerous Clauses of 1922, made it impossible for Jews to enter a University in Hungary. Marci lived in the house of the Goldarbeiters and studied at the Technical University from 1926-1936. Marci secretly loved his cousin Lisl. He started to make films of her, her family and Vienna shortly after his arrival. He was very poor but succeeded in saving cash for his film hobby by walking the city, instead of taking the tram. In 1929, without telling anybody, Marci caused Lisl's entry into the world of beauty; and she became world famous." [<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0846784/plotsummary">IMDB</a>] 2006. 70 min.

Here the viewer travels with Baroness Jeszenszky, and her 8mm film diary from her Buda villa to the Castle in Tolna County.

<dt><b>Tractatus (Kozjatek)</b></dt>
<dd>Presents seven short video essays that refer to Wittgenstein's Tractatus logico-philosophicus with each essay relating to one of Wittgenstein's philosophical propositions. Home movies from early 20th century Europe are accompanied by voiceovers and written texts from Tracatus, and a somber, lyrical score. Scenes of bourgeois life are haunted by foreboding of the future. Drawing up the disjuntion between language and image, Hungarian filmmaker Peter Forgacs created a symbolic illustration of Wittgenstein's theories of logic, language, reality and representation. 1992. 35 min. <b>DVD 3214</b></dd>

<dl>
<dt><b>Children's Tapes</b></dt>
<dd>In this classic early video work, Fox constructs phenomenological dramas from the science of the everyday using fruit, a balanced spoon, a candle and other common items. Fox builds dramatic tension with an extreme economy of means while demonstrating basic physical phenomena. Focusing the camera close to his still-life objects, he constructs a series of elementary experiments that illustrate fundamental principles of physical science. The intimate scale, magnified view, and suspenseful unfolding of minute events in real time all serve to intensify the viewer's perceptions in these engaging mini-narratives. 1974.

<p>As co-founder of the Chicano art group ASCO, Gamboa developed such multi-media forms as the "no-movie" and the "fotonovela," which drew attention to the workings of mass culture. In the mid-1980s, working through cable access, Gamboa produced a series of "conceptual dramas" that explored both stereotypical and traditional notions about the Latino family. In these works, collected here for the first time, Gamboa combined the political influences of the Chicano Movement with the narrative excess of film noir, B-movies, and Mexican telenovelas. 113 min. <b>DVD 2786</b></p>

<dt><b>Performance/Audience/Mirror</b></dt>
<dd>Recorded at Video Free America in San Francisco, this video art work is a phenomenological inquiry into the audience/performer relationbship and the notion of subjectivity/objectivity. Graham stands in front of a mirrored wall facing a seated audience; he describes the audience's movements and what they signify. He then turns and describes himself and the audience in the mirror. First, a person in the audience sees himself 'subjectively', next he hears himself described 'objectively' in terms of the performer's perception. 1975. 23 min. <b>Video/C 5239</b></dd>

<dd>A speech-driven video art piece that self-consciously addresses the nature of a shared reality with the viewer. Around &amp; About is an eloquently concrete conjunction of interiors and closed openings which provides a percussive backdrop for Hill's struggle to break through to the viewer, functioning both on the level of intimate dialogue and universal plea. 1980.

<dd>Contents: Objects with destinations (1979, 3 min.) -- Windows(1978, 8 min.) -- Bathing (1977, 5 min.) -- Bits(1977, 3 min.) -- Mirror Road (1975-76, 7 min.). Early formalist works which explore the manipulation ofelectronic color and image density through the camera obscura and image processing devices. In Objects WithDestinations, ordinary objects move in staccato rhythm across the screen, washed with subtle hues. In Windows, the image of windows in a darkened room isdigitized, densely layered, and otherwise abstracted in a series of graphic compositions. In Bathing, Hill transforms the traditional image of a bathing figure by subtly integrating color video and digitized, re-scanned stills. Bits is an abbreviated study of minutiae, textures and patterns, in which Hill explores editing techniques and rhythm. In Mirror Road, Hill creates an increasingly abstracted harmony of landscapes in layered compositions of movement.

<dd>Contents: Electronic linguistic (1977, 4 min.) -- Sums &amp; differences (1978, 9 min.) -- Black/white/text (1980, 8 min.). In these early works, Hill explores the structural and organic relation of linguistics to electronic phenomena. In Electronic Linguistic, small electronic shapes on the screen move in a gradually accelerating rhythm. In Sums &amp; Differences, images of musical instruments and their corresponding sounds are sequentially switched at an increasingly rapid rate. Black/White/Text is a linguistic deconstruction that represents the syllabic structure of words as text on the screen.

<dl>
<dt><b>Kiyoko's Situation</b></dt>
<dd>Kiyoko's situation articulates the deeply embedded cultural roles of Japanese women through the parallel stories of two female artists, Kiyoko and Tani. In Idemitsu's narrative-within-a-narrative, "Kiyoko's situation" is played out on a television monitor within Tani's drama. Tani is paralyzed in her attempts to paint by her feeling that, as a single woman, she has failed in society's eyes. Kiyoko, a young mother viciously criticized by her husband and family for her fierce determination to paint, eventually compromises her art for "maternal duty." As Kiyoko complies with the family, Tani, isolated and despairing, is driven to suicide. Idemitsu's chillingly omniscient television monitor, which acts as the psychological "other," metaphorically and literally condemns Tani to death. In the final cruel irony, she hangs herself, using the television monitor as a jumping-off point. Performers: Rieko Suzuki, Sumi Ozawa, Michie Ikeda, Rokurou Abe, Masahiko Uchizawa, Koji Takahashi, Momoko Mimura.

A collection of experimental films by Takahiko Iimura, considered one of the most influential and important experimental filmmakers of our time. In an era of the explosion of Underground Film in the States, Iimura, almost alone in Tokyo, began making experimental film just reading the news from abroad without actually seeing them. His work explores a wide range of experiments from poetic cinema with Dadaist and Surrealist influence and Absurdist filmic play in the 1960's through more formal and conceptual investigations in the 1970's and the later. <b>DVD X292</b></dd>

<dt><b>Louis Aim&eacute; Augustin Le Prince: Leeds Bridge 1888</b></dt>
<dd>Writes Ken Jacobs: ""Louis-Aim&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;-Augustin Le Prince was the first person to create, in 1885, a single recording apparatus that photographed images in quick succession on George Eastman's new paper roll film. Le Prince applied for patents but the fix was in, leaving Edison and the Lumi&egrave;re Brothers to profit from his invention. He vanished under mysterious circumstances in 1890. Well, that's business, but I'm sure personal malice was not involved. In 1888 he made a number of short recordings. Here we see Leeds Bridge on a day like any other, its foot and carriage traffic as portentous or as casual as the crisscrossings of the stars. Looped, we Tom Tom some of its infinity of captured gesture." [<a href="http://eai.org/eai/title.htm?id=10763">Electronic Arts Intermix</a>] <b>DVD 7682</b></dd>

<dt><b>Tom, Tom The Piper's Son</b></dt>
<dd>This video release of the 1969 silent experimental film by Ken Jacobs, begins by presenting the entire eight-shot, 10-minute 1905 short film Tom, Tom, the Piper's Son, and then rephotographs it in detail. Segments of the original are run in slow motion, rerun in detail, and enlarged into close-ups and freeze frames. Jacobs photographs the screen, the projector the film is playing on, and at one point includes 10 minutes of blur as images slip off the sprocket holes. The entire film is an act of imaginative rediscovery of "the vivacious doings of persons long dead," as Jacobs once put it, as well as being an exploration of the nature of cinematic storytelling. A Tom Tom Chaser (2002, 11 min.), Jacobs' never before seen creative riff on the transformtion of his film from chemical to electronic form during the telecine process. 120 min.

<dt><b>Johan van der Keuken: The Complete Collection.</b><br></dt>
<dd>&#149;<b>Vol. 1, Disc 1</b> [I]. Contents: I [love] $ (1986, 140 min.) -- [2]. Beauty = Det schoonheid (1970, 21 min.) -- [3] Even stilte = A moment's silence = Un moment de silence (1960-63, 10 min.) Music by Willem Breuker and others. I [love] money: New York, Geneva, Hong Kong and Amsterdam are major hubs of the world's economy. Great amounts of money circulate there, and whereas poverty is ubiquitous in the streets of New York, Geneva carefully protects its wealth behind impeccable facades. No one is unaffected by the myth of the all-powerful Dollar: the under-privileged struggle to survive talking about their unattainable dream, while businessmen, from the safe distance of their offices, lay down the tenets of the financial philosophy. Beauty: The dream world of a fascist spy named Beauty who destroys himself by attempting to impose a rigid working order on the world. The recurring themes of van der Keuken's work -- time, violence, the perception of reality -- are explored here with exceptional intensity. A moment's silence: One of John van der Keuken's first independent projects produced on an extremely modest budget. The coming and going of street traffic in Amsterdam slows and finally the city is immobilized. In the silence, short live sequences introduce simple poetic observations of a peaceful urban landscape. <b>DVD 6638</b></dd>

Music by Willem Breuker and others. Eye above the well: Explores India's spiritual and economic condition, moving from the city to the countryside in the region of Kerala, as it focuses on the essence of that civilization. Captured without commentary by a gliding camera are a cacophony of distinctly nonwestern sights and sounds: the bustling city streets, the serene landscapes of the surrounding countryside, a family preparing for dinner, an elderly actor performing his mythological drama, a modest country moneylender traveling from village to village, young girls at their singing lessons. Lucebert, time and farewell: One of the greatest Dutch poets of the twentieth century, Lucebert was also a major painter who participated in the Cobra movement. This is van der Keuken's acclaimed triptych of three short films on Lucerbert produced in 1962, 1966, and 1994. Unanswered question: A didactic verse on the mechanic (or rather, organic) function of memory and therefore, also on cinema. On animal locomotion: An illustration of the human body in motion with music from the Dutch composer Willem Breuker. <b>DVD 6639</b></dd>

<dd>&#149;<b>Vol. 1, Disc 3</b> Contents: Face value (1991, 120 min.) -- Masque = The mask = Het masker (1989, 53 min.). Music by Willem Breuker and others. Face value: Rejecting linear narrative storytelling, the director offers an epic of humanity and cultural diversity through a cartography of faces, the reflection of an imaginary Europe, made up of London, Marseilles, Prague, and the Netherlands. Mask: During the celebrations of the bicentennial of the French Revolution, Johan van der Keuken made a film about the revolutionary ideas of equality, liberty, and fraternity. Rather than focusing on the festivities, he lingers on the crowds in the metro and on the platform. Among them is a homeless member of the poor class who is ignored by his more affluent countrymen. A cutting perspective on the contraditions that permeate French society. <b>DVD 6640</b></dd>

Summary Diary: Filmed in Cameroon, Morocco, and Holland, this first part of a triptych is dedicated to defining the relationship between poor countries (the developing Southern hemisphere) and rich countries (the industrialized North). White castle: The principal theme of this second part of the North-South triptych is the destruction that marks our existence, and the isolation and despair that are the bitter fruits of "the system." The film weaves itself through three locations: a Spanish island frequented by tourists, a community center in a ghetto of Columbus, Ohio and two factories in the Netherlands. Bert Schierbeek/ The door: An anthology of the work of Dutch poet Bert Schierbeek, inspired by the disappearance of his wife. Vietnam opera: In 1973, a group of Vietnamese actors has come to Amsterdam in the framework of a major demonstration in support of the liberation movement.

<dt><b>Standish Lawder &amp; Stanley Cavell</b></dt>
<dd>A professor of art history and film, a photographer and an inventor, Standish Lawder made truly experimental films by seeing what a predetermined idea about content, structure, or technique will produce when carried out in shooting or printing. Stanley Cavell, philosopher and professor at Harvard, had just published The World Viewed, his first book on film. In this January 1973 episode of Screening Room, Lawder demonstrates the intricacies of his home-made optical printer and shows examples of what can be achieved with rephotographing film. Gardner, Lawder, and Cavell also discuss the intellectual and psychological implications of his manipulations. Their frank commentary carries on over Lawder's test print of Intolerance, which he had just received from the lab and had not yet viewed it himself. Lawder also screens Necrology, Color Film, and Corridor. 1973. 74 min. <b>DVD 5880</b></dd>

<dd>Big Stick: Intercuts two Charlie Chaplin shorts centering on policemen with newsreel footage of police crowd control and street fighting. Levine questions the social implications of media by presenting this discomforting ragout as a political gesture. New left note: Incisively distills the domestic protest, social revolution, and increasing public disillusionment over a protracted Vietnam War that defined the atmosphere of late 60s American culture. With rapid intercutting, disorienting quick pans and looping, Levine approaches filmmaking as a tool for social change -- a visceral chronicle of creative expression and cultural consciousness.

<dt><b>A bient&ocirc;t, j'esp&egrave;re (Be Seeing You)</b></dt>
<dd>A film by Chris Marker. From 1967 to 1976 Chris Marker was a member of SLON (the "Company for the Launching of New Works"), which was based on the idea that cinema should not be thought of solely in terms of commerce. 1967 was also the year an important strike broke out at Rhodiaceta, a textile plant in Besancon, France. Chris Marker and members of SLON visited the city to document the strike and the lives and attitudes of the workers. The film's most important moments are composed of conversations with workers and their wives who believe the working class is at the mercy of a system that would like them to remain powerless. And so it was that their local demands grew to questions about the larger political system. Originally produced in 1968. 39 min. <b>Video/C 9871</b></dd>

<dd>Widely regarded as one of the greatest filmmakers of the 20th century, this is a homage to post-War Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky by his friend and colleague renowned French filmmaker Chris Marker.

<dt><b>La sixi&egrave;eme face du Pentagone (The Sixth Side of the Pentagon)</b>(1967)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Chris Marker and Francois Reichenbach. On October 21, 1967, over 100,000 protestors gathered in Washington, D.C., for the Mobilization to End the War in Vietnam. It was the largest protest gathering yet, and it brought together a wide cross-section of liberals, radicals, hippies, and Yippies. Che Guevara had been killed in Bolivia only two weeks previously, and, for many, it was the transition from simply marching against the war, to taking direct action to try to stop the 'American war machine.' From young men burning their draft cards, to the Yippies chanting "Out, demons, out!," to thousands of protestors rushing the steps of the Pentagon itself and some actually getting into the building, this is a remarkable time capsule and reminder of events from forty years ago, 1967-the turning point of opposition to a long and unpopular war. 26 min. <b>DVD 8639</b></dd>

<dd>Experimental filmmaker Bill Morrison created this non-narrative feature, which derives a large portion of its visual beauty from the physical nature of the film itself which has been set to an original symphonic score. Decasia is primarily compiled from a wealth of old and damaged footage, in which the scratches, scraped emulsion, bubbles, streaks, and decaying nitrate add an extra dimension of texture to this multimedia environmental performance piece. Special features: Audio interview with Bill Morrison and Michael Gordon on PRI's Studio 36 with Kurt Anderson. Jointly commissioned ... by the Basel Sinfonietta and the Europaischer Musikmonat 2001 ... Decasia was conceived as an environmental symphony with projections. Originally released theatrically in 2002. 67 min. <b>DVD 3595</b></dd>

<dt><b>Vital Statistics of a Citizen, Simply Obtained</b></dt>
<dd>This chilling tape probes the objectification of women in a technological society. At its core is a long, continuous shot that reveals the part-by-part measurement and evaluation of a woman by a white-coated male examiner and a chorus of three women assistants. The filmmaker asks: How do we come to see ourselves as objects? How do fragmentation and comparison assist in social control? The final sequences of this film which explores the socially dictated feminine self-image, presents re-framed government photos of women being measured, accompanied by a voiceover litany of "crimes against women."

<dt><b>Prisoner's Dilemma.</b></dt>
<dd>Serra here relies on "game theory" to generate a play-acting situation that criticizes the (television) medium while remaining within it. He directs and "art-star" studded cast in a morality play, a mock game of catch-22. The situation is one of forced, mutual betrayal; it is impossible to win without betraying your comrade or without betraying your own best interest.

<dd>Contents: Boomerang (1974, 10 min., col.) -- Television delivers people / by Richard Serra and Carlota Fay Schoolman (1973, 7 min., b&amp;w) -- Surprise attack (1973, 3 min., b&amp;w) -- Anxious automation (1971, 6 min., b&amp;w).Bommerang: Delves into the psychological aspects of video reproduction. Artist Nancy Holt's words are fed back to her over headphones with a slight delay built into the feedback, causing a dislocation between the action and the sound of speaking: a disjunction that makes her cripplingly aware of her expression. TV Delivers People: While canned Muzak plays, a continuous scrolling text denounces the corporate masquerade of commercial television to reveal the structure of profit that greases the wheels of the media industry. In Surprise Attack, a metal bar is tossed back and forth in Serra's hands while his voice, functioning as a paranoid metaphor, speculates on the nature and limits of self-defense. Anxious Automation involves time-space confusion. Two cameras zoom back and forth, both focused on Joan Jonas who is moving her arms over her head, resulting in a literal space jump and apparent time warp.

<dt><b>Flaming Creatures.</b></dt>
<dd>Sensual underground classic film which pushed the limits of its day while surviving attempts to censor its content, including a series of police raids, arrests, and court battles. "It may seem tame by today's standards, but it stretched the limits of its day. Campy and lavishly designed in its experimentalism, [Smith's] best know film, includes characters which cavort in a setting reminiscent of the court of Ali Baba, with a mood suggestive of the paintings of Heironymous Bosch. The film is a quasi-documentary of Androgynes and Transvestites in which flaccid penises and bouncing breasts are so ambiguously equated as to disarm any distinction between male and female. In Flaming Creatures, Smith manages to combine the ornate imagination of his youth with the realities of his adult fantasy." (from distributor's catalog) <b>Video/C 3258</b></dd>

Hysterical blindness is sight loss brought about by traumatic stress. The video delves into two histories: the history of hysteria and the Cambodian civil war, and speaks about the somatization of pain and loss. <b>Alexia</b>: An experimental video about word-blindness and metaphor, with accounts of Giambattista Vico's theory on the origin of language and Ludwig Wittgenstein's theory on aspect-blindness. Word-blindness is a condition that usually afflicts people who have suffered a stroke, causing them to lose the visual recognition of individual letters but perceive the entire word, or vice versa. <b>Amaurosis</b>: A documentary about Dat Nguyen, a blind guitarist living in Little Saigon, Orange County, California. Dat Nguyen was a "triple outcast": blind, Amerasian, and an impoverished orphan. The tape strives to present the life of one member from this unique community and promote his rich contributions. <b>Epilogue</b>: the palpable invisibility of life: Visualizes the unseen threads between mother and child, revealing how the ties that bind four generations of women become manifest when a great-grandmother's imploring words tp persevere, passed from granddaughter to great granddaugheter, compel a woman to continue her maternal line by ancient means. 2009. 72 min.</dd>

<dt><b>A Tale of Love</b></dt>
<dd>A film loosely inspired by the Tale of Kieu, an early 19th century Vietnamese poem in which a martyred woman sacrifies herself for the good of her family. This film, set in America, portrays the Vietnamese immigrant experience through Kieu, a writer who sends money to her family in Vietnam by working for a woman's magazine. As she works on an article about the legacy of the Tale of Kieu, she comes to understand how the poem resonates in her own life. In the end, overcoming the sorrows of love and exile is, for Kieu, to reinvent both herself and the 200-year-old poem. Director, producer, writer, editor, Trinh T.

<dt><b>Gerald Ford's America</b></dt>
<dd>Scrutinizes the "first one hundred days" of the Ford presidency. In Part 1 WIN (the title refers to the slogan "Whip Inflation Now"), the TVTV crew follows Ford on a goodwill tour of his old constituency in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Having promised to end the "national nightmare" of Vietnam and Watergate, Ford took office only to face inflation and a looming recession. Ironically contrasting political rhetoric with the reality of working and middle-class America, TVTV juxtaposes a main point of Ford's platform -- that Americans should curb their spending habits -- with a GOP fundraiser in which wealthy patrons bid extravagantly for a football once held by Ford. In Part 2 Chick to sheik, the filmmakers examine the assertion that political deal-making occurs at the social level, they take careful note of the high cost of entertaining: $10,000 for one diplomatic function. As an ironic footnote to history, the tape culminates in a party for the Shah of Iran at the Iranian Embassy, complete with birthday toasts to the soon-to-be-ousted ruler. [Part 1] Win (28 min.), 1975 -- [Part 2] Chic to sheik (28 min.), 1975. Produced by TVTV and the TV Lab at WNET/Thirteen; producer, David Loxton.

<dt><b>The Good Times are Killing Me</b></dt>
<dd>Filmed on location in Southwestern Louisiana in 1975, this documentary presents a portrait of Cajun culture. Focusing on the Cajuns' strong cultural identity, the filmmakers document the integral role that music plays in passing traditions from generation to generation. Looking at the events leading up to Mardi Gras, the tape visits women at a beauty parlor, the drag preparations of the "barber's son," and, finally, the pageantry of the celebration itself. At the heart of the tape is accordionist Nathan Abshire, whose jaunty stage manner belies a difficult and harsh life. Abshire is seen as representative of the Cajun culture, which has survived two hundred years of persecution and misunderstanding with its humor and idiosyncracies intact.

With a scathing economy, TVTV lays bare the corruption and hypocrisy of the Maharaj Ji and his entourage, showing the guru as he dispenses pseudo-mystical knowledge to his true believers, led by former antiwar activist Rennie Davis. TVTV's use of portable video equipment afforded them access to the guru's entourage and the duped devotees of the new religion, faded flower children whose yearning for order and meaning seem emblematic of the nation's disaffection and uncertainty in the Watergate and Vietnam era.

Using lightweight, 1/2-inch Portapak equipment, which allowed them greater mobility and spontaneity than the networks, the crew moved around the Convention floor with ease and speed. They came away with shrewd, sardonic portraits of the politicians, delegates and voters, providing an irreverent picture of the behind-the-scenes political maneuvering. TVTV's close coverage of the California delegation, as well as the successful battle to unseat Chicago mayor Richard Daley and his delegates, exemplifies the collective's verite methods.

<dt><b>Four Songs</b></dt>
<dd>Junkyard levitation -- Songs of innocence -- The space between the teeth -- Truth through mass individuation. In referring to his tapes as "songs", Viola emphasizes the relationship of musical structures and the poetics of Romanticism to his work. Junkyard Levitation is a visual pun on the concept of "mind over matter," as a man attempts to levitate while lying prone in a junkyard. In Songs of innocence, shifting light is charted through the passage of a day while images of children singing dissolve and reappear. Space between the teeth is based on the structure of acoustic phenomena and the dynamics of a man screaming at the end of a long dark corridor. Truth through mass individuation references Carl Jung. An Isolated figure is seen performing successively more aggressive actions. Dist. <a href="http://www.eai.org/eai/">Electronic Arts Intermix.</a> 1976. 33 min. <b>Video/C MM1057</b></dd>

Red Tape is a collection of short pieces that function thematically as a larger meta-work. In each of these performative, structuralist exercises, a specific function of perception or representation --as articulated through video technology-- becomes a metaphor for a perspective of the self. Here, Viola establishes themes that recur throughout his work, including cycles of light and dark and the metaphorical restructuring of the passing of time. Writes Viola, "A single figure appears in all the works as either the instigator or recipient of various actions performed on or initiated by nature, culminating in a ritualized cycle of death and renewal."

<dt><b>Andy Warhol's Screen Tests, 1963-1966</b></dt>
<dd>Directed by Andy Warhol; co-director, Ronald Tavel. An omnipresent feature of Andy Warhol's Factory from about 1963 to 1966 was a stationary 16-mm camera mounted on a tripod, before which anyone who entered the studio and exhibited a certain star potential was asked to sit for a screen test. The isolated sitters who had been instructed to stay as still as possible and not to blink, were shot in strong raking light, to reveal unwaveringly their psychological reactions to the intense scrutiny of being filmed. <b>DVD 4736</b></dd>

<dt><b>Drinnen und Draussen (Inside and Outside)</b>(West Germany, 1974)</dt>
<dd>A film set in the front room of a Berlin commune with a large shop window leading to the street outside. The film uses an actor and an actress, a pianist (visible playing the film's incidental music in the room next door) and occasional people on the street. <b>DVD X6265</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><b>Illusive crime</b>(UK, 1976)</dt>
<dd>Probably the most controversial of Woolley's films, because of an audio rape sequence with flashes of nudity that split critics and viewers (especially feminists) right down the middle--some saying it was exploitative, others saying it was essential to get the formalist message (that we are all voyeurs in the cinema, often viewing at the expense of women) across. ..." Cast: James Woolley, Amanda Reiss, Andrew McCulloch, and Colin Proctor. <b>DVD X6265</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><b>Kniephofstrasse</b>(West Germany, 1973)</dt>
<dd>This is Woolley's "most austerely structuralist and painterly" film. "Based around a fixed camera single wide shot of a West Berlin townscape filmed at different times of day and night, at different speeds and in different weathers" <b>DVD X6265</b></dd>
