<dt><b>Uncle Josh at the Moving Picture Show</b> (1902)</dt>
<dd>Director: Edwin S. Porter. Cast: Charles Manley. "Uncle Josh occupies a box at a vaudeville theatre, where a moving picture show is going on. First a dancer appears on the screen. Uncle Josh jumps to the stage and endeavors to make lover to her, but she flits away, and immediately there appears upon the screen the picture of an express train running at sixty miles an hour. Uncle Josh becomes panic-stricken, and fearing to be struck by the train, makes a dash for his box. He is no sooner seated than a country couple appear upon the screen, at a well. Before they pump the pail full of water they indulge in a love-making scene. Uncle Josh thinks he recognizes his own daughter, jumps upon the stage, removes his coat and prepares to chastise the lover, and grabbing the moving picture screen he hauls it down, and to his great surprise finds a kinetoscope operator in the rear. The operator is made furious by Uncle Josh interrupting his show." [IMDB] 2 min. <b>DVD X116; DVD 7983; DVD X1752; vhs Video/C 7046</b></dd>

<dt><b>Cohen's Advertising Scheme</b> (1904)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Edwin S. Porter. Cohen's advertising scheme: This is perhaps the earliest cinematic example of the Jewish stereotype known as the "scheming merchant," a familiar caricature from theater and literature. In this typical one-shot gag film Cohen, a Jewish shop owner, hits upon a new advertising scheme: tricking a passerby into buying a coat on which he hangs a large sign advertising his store on the back. 14 min. <b>DVD X2060; vhs 999:2340</b></dd>

<dt><b>The Whole Dam Family and the Dam Dog</b> (1905)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Edwin S. Porter. "The Whole Dam Family and The Dam Dog is a popular fad which has been widely advertised by lithographs and souvenir mailing cards, and has recently been made the subject of a sketch in a New York Vaudeville Theatre. The Edison Manufacturing Co., with their usual up-to-date methods, have illustrated this popular subject in a most novel and original way in Motion Pictures. The picture opens with a close view of the individual members of the family. Each goes through a very amusing performance. Mr. I.B. Dam is seized with a severe fit of sneezing. Herself relieves her mind through woman's sole weapon. Jimmy Dam shows how a cigarette should be smoked. Miss U.B. Dam is very proud of the marcel wave in her hair. Annie Dam, in a large picture hat, tries to look very shy and demure. Lizzie Dam chews gum in a most artistic manner. Baby Dam gives a sample of his ability at crying. A family group is seated at dinner, with the Dam Dog seated at the head of the table. Mr. I.B. Dam enters and kicks the Dam Dog out of the chair. The Dam Dog waits until the soup has been served, and then returns and drags the table cloth and all the dishes on to the floor. The final scene is most amusing. Different portions of the Dam Dog's body appear from all directions. They finally arrange themselves in shape, showing a dilapidated looking cur sitting up on his haunches. Presently his tail joins his body by piecemeal, the end having two tin cans tied to it. The tail and tin cans begin to wag in a most comical way. The picture has made the biggest kind of a hit, and is one of the best humorous pictures ever offered."

<dt><b>Cohen's Fire Sale</b>(1907)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Edwin S. Porter. "A very early silent short from film pioneer Edwin S. Porter. Based on popular vaudeville routines of the day, the title character is a made up in a rather grotesque, broadly stereotyped manner and the sketch itself could definitely be viewed as an offensive piece. A Jewish store owner sees his new shipment of hats picked up by the trash wagon and chases the vehicle down to recapture his merchandise. When the hats don't sell anyway, he sets his business on fire to collect the insurance money."

<dt><b>The Renunciation</b> (1909)</dt>
<dd>Directed by D.W. Griffith. Cast: Mary Pickford, Anthony O'Sullivan, James Kirkwood. D.W. Griffith's Renunciation is a comedy western, filmed in the wilds of Shadyside, New Jersey. Fascinated by a pair of handsome cowboys, the heroine flirts shamelessly with both men. It isn't long before the two old pals of the saddle are bitter enemies. As they prepare to square off in a knife battle, the girl breaks up the fight by introducing her real boyfriend, a limp-wristed "pansy" type. Astonished that the girl would choose a sissy-boy over them, the two cowpokes vow eternal friendship and swear off women for good (or, at least, for now). Mary Pickford, Billy Quirk and Harry Salter are starred in this one-reel trifle. 11 min <b>vhs 999:3378; vhs 999:595</b></dd>

<dt><b>Cohen Saves the Flag (Mabel Saves Her Darlings)</b> (1913)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Mack Sennett. Cast: Ford Sterling, Mabel Normand, Henry Lehrman. "'Cohen Saves the Flag' is a very early Keystone comedy, one of several starring Ford Sterling as a scruffy coward named Izzy Cohen. All of the instalments in the 'Cohen' series feature some humour based on Jewish stereotypes, which has dated badly; fortunately, these films also have clever storylines and non-ethnic slapstick gags, so (with the possible exception of 'Cohen Collects a Debt') these films are still funny in spite of some (arguably) anti-Semitic content. All of the other 'Cohen' shorts are set in the contemporary present; 'Cohen Saves the Flag' backdates Izzy Cohen to 1861 in order to put him in a Civil War setting."

<dt><b>How Men Propose</b>(1913)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Lois Weber. Cast: Chester Barnett, Margarita Fischer, Grace Darling, Phillips Smalley. "How Men Propose illustrates Lois Weber's interest in male-female relationships, even in this early comic short. Structured around repetition and reversal, the comedy shows its heroine entertaining multiple marriage proposals from different suitors, each unaware of the other. If at first the humor seems to revolve around the heroine?s fickleness, those assumptions are reversed in the final scene. There we learn she is a professional journalist studying how men propose and wisely exploiting the men's willingness to be fooled by her feminine charms. By keeping viewers unaware of the heroine's motives until the end, the film challenges expectations about conventional male and female behavior." 6 min. <b>DVD 645; vhs 999:1024</b></dd>

<dt><b>A Roman Scandal</b>(1919)</dt>
<dd>Director: Al Christie. Cast: Colleen Moore, Earle Rodney, Eddie Barry. Stage struck Colleen Moore - in an early role without her famous bob, but looking adorable nonetheless -- insists that she won't marry Earle Rodney because she is going to devote her life to the stage -- and the small-town stage at that, where the leading man shares his dressing room with a cow. This comedy is not short on laughs, but excels by virtue of Miss Moore's charming enthusiasm. The 'Roman spectacle' that they watch is excruciatingly funny in its cheapness. <b>DVD X6825</b></dd>

<dd>Directed by James Parrott. Cast: Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. "The Laurel &amp; Hardy Moving Co. have a challenging job on their hands (and backs): hauling a player piano up a monumental flight of stairs to Prof. von Schwarzenhoffen's house. Their task is complicated by a sassy nursemaid and, unbeknownst to them, the impatient Prof. von Schwarzenhoffen himself. But the biggest problem is the force of gravity, which repeatedly pulls the piano back down to the bottom of the stairs. Finally, the irate Professor explodes in fury to discover the "mechanical blunderbuss" in his home, not knowing it was a surprise birthday present from his wife."

Part of this confusion may have been because the Stooges still were not the same lovable team we have all come to know. Instead, they were essentially the vaudeville team of Ted Healy and His Stooges--with the obnoxious and totally untalented and unlikable Healy as the front man. In real life, Healy was an alcoholic and bitter man--leading to his being beaten to death in a bar fight shortly after the Stooges decided to quit the act."

<dt><b>I'm No Angel</b> (1933)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Wesley Ruggles. Cast: Mae West, Cary Grant, Edward Arnold, Gregory Ratoff. The bold Tira works as a dancing beauty and lion tamer at a fair. Out of an urgent need of money, she agrees to a risky new number: she'll put her head into the lion's mouth! With this attraction the circus makes it to New York and Tira can persue her dearest occupation: flirting with rich men. Among the guys she searches for the love of her life, from whom she only knows from a fortune-teller that he'll be rich and have black hair. When she finally meets him, she becomes a victim of intrigue. "West, more imposing than coquettish as Tira the Lion Tamer, wields physical presence like a boxer and sexuality like a gunslinger throughout the film. From her opening scene, where she's introduced to a carnival crowd as "the girl who discovered you don't need feet to be a dancer," until the end, when she gets her man (Cary Grant, 29 years old and looking about 14, as upstanding society fellow Jack Clayton), Tira owns the screen. It's not hard to imagine either why I'm No Angel, often considered the last film of pre-code Hollywood, was the breaking straw for the Hays Office, or why Depression-era audiences loved it so much. Tira violates conventions of race, class, and (of course) sex, and she goes entirely unpunished by the plot of the film. Instead, West, who took sole credit for the story, screenplay and dialogue, is careful to give herself the last laugh--the real currency of a film like this one--in every scene. In the climactic trial, she cross-examines much of her romantic history to prove, to a judge and jury with whom she flirts hilariously, that she's "no angel" but that she is, indisputably, a heroine. Here at SFist, we are hard pressed to think of a recent studio film in which a hypersexual female lead gets away with so much."

<dt><b>Watch the Birdie</b>(1935)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Lloyd French. Cast: Bob Hope. "Watch the Birdie is the title of this early short comedy starring Bob Hope and Arline Dinintz which finds the couple on a cruise ship with her younger sister and parents. Bob's character is a practical joker with a lot of those early gag toys like the telescope that leaves the black eye, a snake springing out of a lighter, several squirt gun gags and of course his camera that you can "watch the birdie" (as one shoots out at the subject). The camera has a dual function in which you have to see the film to see how it adds to the fun. It's old fashioned humor from a more simpler time that will undoubtedly bore most younger fans. Notice the level of dress with suits and dresses and hats even at leisure on a cruise ship in the day. Bob's character asks later in the film what some higher ups are doing in a board room, to which his fianc&eacute;e responds, "they're figuring out a way to solve the depression." He says, "oh, you mean they're going to give everybody money," and she astutely replies, "no, but they're going to make everybody forget that they haven't got it!" History might just be repeating itself today so go out and make it fun to smile for the camera." [<a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0157176/#comment">IMDB</a>] 18 min.

<dd>Directed by Richard Boleslawski.

A staid Connecticut town is scandalized when it discovers that the author of a sexually-explicit bestselling novel is actually a local girl. Based on an original story by Mary McCarthy. "Information in the MPAA/PCA Collection at the AMPAS Library reveals that Columbia first submitted the script to the PCA in Mar 1936. However, the PCA rejected the script because it violated several tenets of the Code. In a letter to Harry Cohn, PCA president Joseph I. Breen details the various elements in violation of the Code: The heroine, Theodora, exemplifies "evil made to appear attractive" after she breaks up two marriages; all the "decent" and "church-going" characters are "made to appear ridiculous, stupid and silly" when compared with their city counterparts, who "indulg[e] in extra-marital activities, drunkenness and debauchery, [and] are made to appear attractive." A second revised script was submitted to the PCA in Apr 1936 and was met with approval."

<dd>Director Harry Lachman. Cast: Fay Wray, Richard Dix, Victor Kilian, Franklin Pangborn. A comedy/drama about a silent-screen cowboy who can't quite adjust to talkies, the death of westerns or to playing a modern-day gangster. Then the desperate actor walks into a bank just as it's being robbed and gets into a shoot-out with the crooks and becomes a real-life hero. With his name in all the papers -- and Westerns once again a popular commodity -- the studio signs him up to a new contact, along with Gloria. Franklin Pangborn does one of his amusing turns in a bit part as a dialog coach. Features a host of doubles for many of the biggest stars of the day.

<dt><b>Christmas in Connecticut</b>(1945)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Peter Godfrey. Cast: Barbara Stanwyck, Dennis Morgan, Sydney Greenstreet, Reginald Gardiner, S. Z. Sakall, Robert Shayne. "Smart housekeeping" columnist Elizabeth Lane's publisher, Sydney Greenstreet, invites himself and a handsome war hero to her fictitious Connecticut home for Christmas. Lane quickly rounds up a cottage, husband, baby and cook before the guests arrive, but real trouble begins when 'married' Lane begins to fall in love with engaged navy man Jones. Notable is the film's "delightful focus on food. Everyone seems to be either eating or talking about food here, from Jeff and his pal detailing the meals they can't wait to eat once they get out of the hospital, to the rotund Yardley's total dismissal of the concept of diet while at the farm, to Felix arguing over cooking and use of the farm's kitchen with the cook, Nora (Una O'Connor: Cavalcade). Christmas in Connecticut is so unrepentant and downright brazen in its love of food that it seems practically sinful from our point of view today, when denying the sensuous pleasures of food is supposedly a virtue."

<dd>Directed by Harold S. Bucquet.

Pat Jamieson is a scientist working on a high-altitude oxygen mask for World War II fighter pilots. He has nowhere to conduct his research until he meets Jamie Rowan, a woman with a large empty country house. She has no hopes of marrying for love but Jamie wants to help the war effort and she likes Pat, so to satisfy the proprieties they agree on a business arrangement: a marriage of convenience and partnership. They happily work on oxygen mixes instead of honeymooning. But as the footing of their relationship begins warm up, Jamie is courted by another man and the old flame that broke Pat's heart is back in his life. It will take a sleepwalking ruse, dodging in and out of doors, and a working oxygen mask to get them together again. Based on the play by Philip Barry. 110 min. <b>DVD 7602</b></dd>

Orphaned Addie is left in the care of unethical travelling Bible salesman Moses Pray, who may or may not be her father.

They join forces as swindlers, working together so well that Addie is averse to breaking up the team -- which is one reason that she sabotages the romance between Moses and good-time gal Trixie. Later Moses runs afoul of a bootlegger and is nearly beaten to death by the criminal's twin-brother sheriff. Painfully pulling himself together, Moses gets Addie to her relatives, whereupon she adamantly refuses to leave his side.

<dd>Directed by Joel Zwick. Cast: Nia Vardalos, John Corbett, Lainie Kazan, Michael Constantine, Gia Carides, Louis Mandylor, Bess Meisler, Andrea Martin, Joey Fantone. Toula is a quiet, devoted daughter in a big, crazy Greek family. "Toula Portokalos ruefully comments that like all Greek women, she was put upon this earth for three purposes: to marry a Greek man, to have Greek children, and to feed everyone until the day she dies. When she defies two of these expectations by falling in love Ian Miller, a WASP vegetarian, neither the couple nor their families can quite comprehend the eating habits of the other's culture. At the wedding reception Toula's father, who specialized in finding the Greek root of any word, declares that "Miller" comes from the Greek word for apple, and "Portokalos" is based on the Greek word for oranges--and so "in the end we're all fruits.'"

Cast: Catherine O'Hara, Ed Begley, Jr., Eugene Levy, Harry Shearer, Christopher Moynihan, Christopher Guest, Jennifer Coolidge, Parker Posey, Michael McKean, Bob Balaban, John Michael Higgins, Fred Willard, Jane Lynch. It's about an indie movie called "Home for Purim," a somewhat inane drama about a dysfunctional Jewish family living in the South during World War II. But while the film is still in production, a reporter for an online entertainment site drops the word -- based on a brief visit to the set -- that one of the ensemble cast performers may be an Oscar contender. It goes on to chronicle how the Oscar buzz affects the director, additional cast members, writers, an agent, a publicist, and the hosts from an Hollywood entertainment-type television program. 86 min. <b>DVD 7294</b></dd>

<dt><b>[Foxx, Red] Fugg it!!! The Very Best of Red Foxx</b>[Sound recording]</dt>
<dd>Long before Eddie Murphy, Andrew Dice Clay, or Howard Stern raised the ire of censors and threatened the delicate sensibilities of mainstream American good taste, there was Redd Foxx, arguably the most notorious "blue" comic of his day. Prior to finding fame in the 1970s as the star of the popular sitcom Sanford and Son, Foxx found little but infamy throughout the first several decades of his performing career; salty and scatological, his material broke new ground with its point-blank riffs and brazen discussions of sex and color, and although his party albums were generally banned from white-owned record stores, the comedian's funky narrative style and raspy delivery proved highly influential on comic talents of all ethnic backgrounds. Contents: Introduction -- My ugly wife -- A poem -- Voting -- Roadrunner -- Paratrooper -- Drinking and driving -- Electric chair -- Fighting midgets -- Parking it in the park -- Cannibals -- Chick in the bar -- Oh George -- French girl -- You moved -- Almond joy -- Rich girl, poor girl -- Triplets -- Boss -- Boy -- Thanksgiving pussy -- Color matters -- KKK wizard -- Dressmakers -- Fugg soap -- Snot -- Licking ice cream -- Virgin -- Wahoo -- Nurse treatment -- Bras and shorts -- Manischevitz wine -- Sheep in the fence -- Crocodile hunting -- Chains -- That's my wife -- Tiger's lips -- Dairy queen -- Baldness -- Farmers' costume trek -- Meat and fish -- My dick -- Snake bite -- 500 legs and a cherry -- The preacher and the lion -- The preacher's wife -- Costume party I &amp; II -- Confucius I, III -- World war III -- Two fives for a ten -- Tarzan -- Redd Foxx international -- Mop bucket -- Pregnant man -- World war II -- A poem to women -- Confucius IV -- I love England -- Railroad track -- Early bird -- Pancho Villa -- Long Island duck -- LBJ -- Farmer's daughter -- Furniture business -- My front door is open -- Mary -- Lady on a bus -- I've been raped -- Drinkin' -- No lickety split -- Canary -- Brass nuts -- Screwing the boss -- Prejudice in the movies -- No clothes -- Newlyweds -- Raffle win -- The cop and the waitress -- Pussy face -- My dick II -- Teflon and vaseline -- Fukawi Indians -- Hobo in New York -- Elevator operator -- Congo -- In the bar -- Greek/French -- Horse manure to go -- Eyebrows -- Confucius II -- Little red riding hood -- Ham and eggs -- Mexican speed bump -- Black cats -- House of ill repute -- Closing. <b>Sound/D 243</b></dd>

Old men -- Soul food -- Children -- Hip to be square -- Backhanded in church -- Talkin' about men -- Hellen Hunt -- Everybody's crazy -- Good old days -- Friends -- Air plane trip -- White House lawn -- Fortune teller.

Billed as "The Funniest Woman in the World," she tackled topics too edgy for many other comics of the time, including racism. She got away with it courtesy of her persona: onstage she appeared to be a small, bedraggled woman in a housedress and a funny hat, a 1950's version of a "bag-lady" persona. <b>Sound/D 242</b></dd>
