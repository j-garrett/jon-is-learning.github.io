<dd>Contents: Introduction (2 min.) -- A Natural born gambler (1916, si. with English intertitles, 18 min.) -- Fish (si.,1916, 9 min.) -- Nobody (audio recording, 1906, 3 min.) Egbert Austin "Bert" Williams was one of the preeminent entertainers of the Vaudeville era and one of the most popular comedians for all audiences of his time. A key figure in the development of African-American entertainment, he was by far the best-selling black recording artist before 1920. He became the first black American to take a lead role on the Broadway stage, and did much to push back racial barriers during his career. <b>DVD X5041</b></dd>

<dt><b>A Natural Born Gambler</b> (1916)</dt>
<dd>Director: Bert Williams. "Our story centers upon the activities of a Negro fraternal organization, the Independent Order of Calcimine Artists of America. [Inside joke: "calcimine" is whitewash, and yet most of these black actors appear to have darkened their complexions with blackface makeup.] The group meets in the back of a saloon. Their leader, Brother Scott, is a lawyer who disapproves of gambling-- although, after breaking up a poker game, he doesn't object to appropriating others' winnings. Our protagonist is lodge member Bert Williams, described as a "walking delegate," who is clearly in arrears with both the saloon's barkeep, Hostetter Johnson, and with the lodge itself. Early on, he is compelled to remit the dues he owes (three dollars), which he does reluctantly. [Some prints of the film omit the next sequence: After leaving a meeting with his friend Limpy Jones, who is handicapped with gout and must ride on Bert's shoulders..."

Cast: Josephine Baker, Helene Hallier, Andre Luguet, Pepa Bonafe, Gretchikine, Madame Komakova, Ludovic, Lila Nikolska, Skibinne, Tiller's Follies Girls, Ruth Zackey and the Hoffmann Girls. Helene Hallier, an ambitious by innocent would-be young chorine, trumps a music hall publicity stunt to become the new Parisian nightclub sensation. The light story is only a pretext for La Revue des Revues' white-hot, non-stop procession of outrageously and scantily attired exotic dancers, showgirls, and acrobats including the Tiller's Follies Girls, Ruth Zackey and the Hoffman Girls, and danseuse russe Lila Nikolska. But it's Josephine Baker, "the high priestess of primitivism" who triumphs in two show stopping numbers. 103 min. <b>DVD 9107</b></dd>

<dt><b>Hallelujah</b> (1929)</dt>
<dd>Directed by King. Vidor. Cast: Daniels L. Haynes, Nina Mae McKinney, William Fountaine, Harry Gray, Fanny Belle DeKnight, Everett McGarrity, Victoria Spivey, Dixie Jubilee Singers. An all-Black cast film which depicts the life of a rural southern Black family written according to racist stereotypes prevalent in 1929. Themes show illiterate Black plantation life, singing, dancing and gambling, religious beliefs and practices, including a special baptism sequence, and the relationships between men and women in a "sinful environment". "Made when screen musicals were mainly backstage stories or all-star revues, "Hallelujah!" broke the mold. Director King Vidor, given the go-ahead only after pledging his salary to offset production costs, combines melodrama with work songs and spirituals...a sincere and sympathetic treatment of rural black life." 90 min. <b>DVD 4965; vhs 999:1432</b></dd>

<dt><b>The African Dodger</b> (1931)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Mort Blumenstock. Cast: Tom Howard, Joe Lyons, Edward Gargan. "In the early twentieth century, many American carnivals and fun fairs featured an "African Dodger". This was a Negro (usually genuine, sometimes a white man in blackface) who would stick his head through a hole and taunt the suckers, who paid a nickel for the privilege of throwing baseballs at the African Dodger. The dodger would (usually) pull his head out of the hole in time to avoid getting hit, but sometimes he wasn't fast enough. African Dodgers were so commonplace that some sadistic people would bring a hard (wooden or iron) ball into any carnival that came to town, knowing they'd have a chance to throw it at a black man's head and cause him serious injury." In this film comedian Tom Howard plays a man on a carnival midway who gets suckered into substituting for the African Dodger. 91 min. <b>DVD X2036; vhs 999:2637</b></dd>

<dt><b>Home of the Brave</b> (1949)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Mark Robson. Cast: Lloyd Bridges, James Edwards, Frank Lovejoy, Douglas Dick, Steve Brodie, Jeff Corey. "A paralyzed African-American war veteran Private Peter Moss (Edwards) begins to walk again only when he confronts his fear of forever being an "outsider." The film utilizes the recurrent theme of a diverse group of men being subjected to the horror of war and their individual reactions, in this case, the hell of jungle combat against the Japanese in WW II. The soldier's comrades include his lifelong white friend Finch (Bridges), whose death leaves him racked with guilt; redneck-bigot corporal (Brodie); and troubled Sergeant Mingo (Lovejoy). In the film's crucial scene, the doctor (Corey) forces Moss to overcome his paralysis by yelling a racial slur; from this point on, Moss will never again kowtow to prejudice." [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_of_the_Brave_(1949_film)">Wikipedia</a>] Based upon an original play by Arthur Laurents. 86 min. <b>DVD X5695; vhs 999:3670</b></dd>

When she names Pinky heiress to her estate, the community rises in resentment triggering a-sensational court trial.

It's too much to resist for Earl Slater, a bigoted ex-con slumming through life with a patronizing girlfriend and zero expectations. He agrees to be part of a bank job planned by former cop Burke. Until, that is, he finds out one of his partners will be a black man. Earl's desperate need for cash, however, leads him to reconsider. For this job only, he'll put his racism aside ... until moments away from the score, hatred erupts. In this film to obtain the edgy look desired by the director a rare filming technique was used: infrared photography. <b>DVD 2229</b></dd>

<dt><b>White Dog</b> (1988)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Samuel Fuller. Cast: Kristy McNichol, Paul Winfield, Burl Ives, Jameson Parker, Christa Fuller, Sam Fuller, Lynne Moody, Marshall Thompson. A German shepherd is adopted by an actress who learns that the dog has been trained to attack only African Americans. Now it's up to an animal trainer to try to change the vicious dog.
<p>""This is a thriller, and it's also a complete metaphor," said Sam Fuller of his controversial feature which went unreleased theatrically for ten years. Loosely based on a story by Romain Gary, White Dog concerns a dog trained to attack blacks. Paul Winfield portrays a trainer who takes on the task of deprogramming the animal on behalf of its new owner (Kristy McNichol). With frequent point-of-view shots from the dog's perspective, Fuller makes a case for his thesis, which is that racism is "a disease created by man" and that infecting the animal is itself a form of violence. The idea of a "white dog" is dehumanizing, but accusations of racism toward Fuller were perhaps derived from a misunderstanding of the film's content, as well as intent. In Gary's story, the dog is retrained to attack whites, perpetuating the cycle of racism; Fuller's version has Winfield (in a fine performance) attempting to cure the dog. Overlooking Fuller's history of anti-racist films, the NAACP urged a boycott, inspiring the studio to shelve the finished film." [<a href="http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/film/FN10045">Pacific Film Archives - Banned in the USA</a>] Based on the story by Romain Gary. Special features: Interviews with Jon Davison, Curtis Hanson and Sam Fuller's widow, Christa Lang-Fuller; interview with dog trainers Karl Lewis-Miller; rare photos from the films production; booklet featuring essays by critics J. Hoberman and Armond White. 90 min. <b>DVD X3145</b></p>

<dt><a name="McDaniel" id="McDaniel"><b>Hattie McDaniel</b> (June 10, 1895 &ndash; October 25, 1952)</a><br></dt>
<dt>"After working as early as the 1910s as a band vocalist, Hattie McDaniel debuted as a maid in The Golden West (1932). Her maid-mammy characters became steadily more assertive, showing up first in Judge Priest (1934) and becoming pronounced in Alice Adams (1935). In this one, directed by George Stevens and aided and abetted by star Katharine Hepburn, she makes it clear she has little use for her employers' pretentious status seeking. By The Mad Miss Manton (1938) she actually tells off her socialite employer Barbara Stanwyck and her snooty friends. This path extends into the greatest role of her career, Mammy in Gone with the Wind (1939). Here she is, in a number of ways, superior to most of the white folk surrounding her. From that point here roles unfortunately descended, with her characters becoming more and more menial. She played on the "Amos and Andy" and Eddie Cantor radio shows in the 1930s and 1940s; the title in her own radio show "Beulah" (1947-51), and the same part on TV ("Beulah" (1950)). Her part in Gone with the Wind (1939) won her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, the first black to win an Academy Award." [IMDB]<br>

<dt>Stepin Fetchit was the stage name of American comedian and film actor Lincoln Theodore Monroe Andrew Perry (May 30, 1902&ndash;November 19, 1985). His typical film persona and stage name have long been synonymous with the stereotype of the servile, shiftless, simple-minded black man in early 20th Century American film. There has been a more recent revisionist view that sees his film persona as ultimately subversive of the status quo. Perry parlayed the Fetchit persona into a successful film career, eventually becoming a millionaire, the first black actor in history to do so.

<dt><b>The African Dodger</b> (1931)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Mort Blumenstock. Cast: Tom Howard, Joe Lyons, Edward Gargan. "In the early twentieth century, many American carnivals and fun fairs featured an "African Dodger". This was a Negro (usually genuine, sometimes a white man in blackface) who would stick his head through a hole and taunt the suckers, who paid a nickel for the privilege of throwing baseballs at the African Dodger. The dodger would (usually) pull his head out of the hole in time to avoid getting hit, but sometimes he wasn't fast enough. African Dodgers were so commonplace that some sadistic people would bring a hard (wooden or iron) ball into any carnival that came to town, knowing they'd have a chance to throw it at a black man's head and cause him serious injury." In this film comedian Tom Howard plays a man on a carnival midway who gets suckered into substituting for the African Dodger. 91 min. <b>DVD X2036; vhs 999:2637</b></dd>

<dt><b>The Jazz Singer</b> (1927)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Alan Crosland. Cast: Al Jolson, May McAvoy, Warner Oland, William Demarest, Eugenie Besserer, Otto Lederer, Josef Rosenblatt. A melodramatic story of a Jewish cantor's son (Al Jolson) who aspires to be a jazz singer despite his father's objection and religious tradition. In motion picture history, this marks the first feature film to utilize synchronous sound. Jolson's songs include "Toot, toot, tootsie", "Blue skies", and "Mammy". 89 min. <b>DVD 8594; vhs 999:790</b>
<p>"Since its premiere in 1927, many jazz critcs have overlooked The Jazz Singer, America's pioneer talking picture, in the history of American jazz film. Despite its title, the talkie's account of Old World vs. New World tension and Jewish assimilation has little to do with the jazz sound made famous by such artists as Louis Armstrong and Jelly Roll Morton. Yet as crtic Krin Gabbard argues, the film's appropriation of the title jazz reflects the cultural understanding of "jazz" during the American Jazz Age. In the 1920s, jazz, referring in general to up-tempo music, represented the emotional release and freedom of a generation striving to break established social conventions. While African American contributions to jazz were largely overlooked in the rise of Paul Whiteman and Al jolson's fame, blackface minstrelsy of the age represented white Americans attempt to ventriloquize blacks associated with supposed freedom of Negro primitivisim. Using jazz to represent Raboniwitz's break from Old World tradition and featuring a finale in blackface minstrelsy, The Jazz Singer (as Gabbard argues) lays the foundation for cultural representations of jazz in American cinema."

<dt><b>Neighbors</b>(1920)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Buster Keaton and Eddie Cline. Keaton and his attractive neighbor pass love notes through holes in a fence because of their disapproving families. But even once the couple gets together, their union and upcoming marriage cause even more problems. Keaton swings from clotheslines by his toes, wiggles with his head in the ground like a human carrot, and has a hilarious inability to keep his pants up. The Neighbors also features racial attitudes that are beyond troubling. Like a number of Keaton productions, the hero ends up in black face, only this time he escapes in time to wash his face, leading to the arrest of an innocent African-American passing by. When Keaton is caught again and again ends up in black-face, he somehow manages to clean half his face and enters into a routine of being half-white (dignified and controlled) and half-black (he dances a jig). 18 min. <b>DVD 293</b></dd>

<dt><b>Whoopee!</b>(1930)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Thornton Freeland. Cast: Eddie Cantor, Ethel Shutta, Paul Gregory, Eleanor Hunt, John Rutherford, Spencer Charters. A musical sparked by Cantor's performance as a hyper-hypochondriac. Out West, Henry Williams (Cantor) helps Sally flee her wedding, unaware that she has left a note behind saying they've eloped. Features some of Busby Berkeley's most fanciful choreography. "As it facilitates intermarriage in The Jazz Singer, so blackface brings Whoopee!'s Indian and white lovers together. Henry, helping Sally escape her wedding to Sheriff Bob, hides in an oven. When the stove is lit, he explodes out in blackface. Like Whiteman's lion, Jolson's mammy, and the prototypical, exaggerated blackface mouth, the oven associates blackface with primitive orality. The disguise fools Sheriff Bob and encourages Sally to confess her love for Wanenis. Promoting anarchic violence against the forces of law and order, blackface also facilitates intermarriage in the low plot. Cantor sings "My Baby Just Cares for Me" in blackface and sings it again sans cork to Nurse Custer to end the film. Transforming Jew from frightened melancholic into trickster, blackface shifts the meaning of "cares for" from nursing to sex. When Sheriff Bob tries to wipe Henry clean, he leaves him with what look like Orthodox Jewish earlocks and beard." [Rogin, Michael.

<dd>Directed by Rudolf Ising. "...this is a subdued, one might even say sweet, tribute to black music and culture. A sort of animated CARMEN JONES, if you like. While the principal players being caricatured as crows might bring howls of "racism" now, one can easily forgive such a practice in this cartoon--indeed, it seems perfectly logical. One would expect crows, if they could talk, sing and dance, to put on a show such as this."

<dt><b>Scar of Shame</b> (1927)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Frank Peregini. The Colored Players Film Co. produced films during the 1920's, the golden years of silent films. "The prime achievement of the Colored Players was this film, shot with a sure feeling for editing and composition the film compares with the best Hollywood product of its time. The film's story examines caste and class within the black community telling of a love affair between a music student of good social standing and the daughter of a working-class drunkard. "Made by Hollywood technicians, The Scar of Shame is nevertheless the product of black consciousness, examining as it does caste and class within the black community. The 'hero' is a light-skinned, refined music student of good social standing who, very much against his better judment, falls in love and marries the dark sensual daughter of a working-class drunkard. Expressing profound and probably unconscious reservations about the possibility of black success while limiting that success to that black who is like the white in values and appearance..." -- excerpt from AFI program notes by Stephen Zito.

<dt><b>Ten Minutes to Live</b> (1932)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Oscar Micheaux. Cast: Laurence Chenault, A.B. Comathiere, Laura Bowman, Willor Lee Guilford, Tressie Mitchell. A mystery-musical built around a threatening note which gives the heroine only "ten minutes to live." The heroine sings and dances in a Harlem nightclub. Much nightclub business as the mystery unravels with song and dance numbers and a stand up comedy routine. A fine example of the film-making efforts from the pioneer African-American directors and production companies of the 1930's, who made films that were typically excluded from mainstream movie houses due to the prevailing attitudes of the time. 65 min. <b>DVD X47; DVD X4916; vhs 999:1217</b></dd>

<dd>Directed by Haile Gerima. Cast: Kofi Ghanaba, Oyafunmike Ogunlano, Alexandra Duah, Nick Medley, Mutabaruka, Afemo Omilami, Reginald Carter, Mzuri. Sankofa is an Akan word that means, "We must go back and reclaim our past so we can move forward; so we understand why and how we came to be who we are today." Written, directed and produced by Ethiopian-born filmmaker Haile Gerima, SANKOFA is a powerful film about Maafa-the African holocaust. Done from an African/African-American perspective, this story is a vastly different one from the generally distorted representations of African people that Hollywood gives us. This revolutionary feature film connects enslaved black people with their African past and culture. It empowers Black people on the screen by showing how African peoples' desire for freedom made them resist, fight back, and conspire against their enslavers, overseers and collective past through the vision on Mona, who visits her ancestral experience on a new world planation as Shola. We share the life she endures as a slave and experiences her growing consciousness and transformation [description from web site]. 1993. 125 min. <b>DVD X4821; vhs 999:1596</b></dd>
