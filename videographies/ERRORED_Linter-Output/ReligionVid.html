In the first of a six part series sweeping across four continents, Professor MacCulloch goes in search of Christianity's forgotten origins. He overturns the familiar story that it all began when the apostle Paul took Christianity from Jerusalem to Rome. Instead, he shows that the true origins of Christianity lie east, and at one point appeared to be poised to triumph in Asia. <B>DVD X3548</B>

<P><DD><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border=0> <B>Episode 2. Catholicism : The Unpredicatable Rise of Rome. </B> The second segment of this 6-part series explores the rise of the Roman Catholic Church.   Over one billion Christians look to Rome - that's more than half of all Christians on the planet. But how did a small Jewish sect from the backwoods of 1st century Palestine, which preached humility and the virtue of poverty, become the established religion of Western Europe - wealthy, powerful and expecting unfailing obedience from the faithful?  <B>DVD X3549</B>



<P><DD><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border=0>Episode 3. Orthodoxy: From Empire to Empire.
Today, Eastern Orthodox Christianity flourishes in the Balkans and Russia with over 150 million members worldwide. It's quite unlike Catholicism or Protestantism: worship is carefully choreographed, icons pull the faithful into a mystical union with Christ, and everywhere is a symbol of a fierce-looking bird - the double-headed eagle. In his third journey into the History of Christianity Diarmaid MacCulloch charts Orthodoxy's extraordinary fight for survival. <B>DVD X3550</B>

Reformation: The Individual Before God. </B> In the fourth part of his History of Christianity Diarmaid MacCulloch makes sense of the Reformation, and of how a faith based on obedience and authority gave birth to one based on individual conscience. He shows how Luther wrote hymns to teach people the message of the Bible, and how Ulrich Zwingli - a Swiss Reformer - encouraged followers to tear down statues of saints, allow married clergy and denied that communion bread and wine were the body and blood of Christ. <B>DVD X3551</B>


<P><DD><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border=0><B>Episode 5. Protestantism: The Evangelical Explosion.</B> Traces the growth of an exuberant expression of faith that has spread across the globe - Evangelical Protestantism. The Evangelical explosion has been driven by a concern for social justice and the claim that you could stand in a direct emotional relationship with God. It allowed the Protestant faith to burst its boundaries from its homeland in Europe. In America, it has become associated with conservative politics and its preachers have marketed Christianity with all the flair and swashbuckling enterprise of American commerce. In Africa it converted much of the continent by adapting to local traditions, and now it's expanding into Asia. <B>DVD X3552</B>


<P><DD><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border=0><B>Episode 6. God in the Dock.</B> In the last program in the series MacCulloch challenges the simplistic notion that faith in Christianity has steadily ebbed away before the relentless advance of science, reason and progress and shows instead how the tide of faith perversely flows back in. Despite the attacks of Newton, Voltaire, the French Revolutionaries and Darwin, Christianity has shown a remarkable resilience. The greatest damage to Christianity in fact was inflicted to its moral credibility by the two great wars of the 20th century and by its entanglement with Fascism and Nazism. And yet it is in crisis that the Church has rediscovered deep and enduring truths about itself.  <B>DVD X3553</B>

Everett Koop, as Surgeon General.  By the mid-80s, though, AIDS hits home even in fundamentalists circles and Koop splits with his former allies over the proper Christian response to this 'sign of God's judgement.'  Pat Robertson mobilizes an 'invisible army' to support his bid for the presidency.  Though dogged by televangelist scandals, the Robertson campaign sets the agenda for George Bush's victory over Michael Dukakis. Narrator: Cliff Robertson.

<dt><b>This Far by Faith, African-American Spiritual Journeys.</b> <p>

<DD><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><B>Episode one:</B> There is a river explores the evolution of African-American religious thought, from the beliefs and rituals Africans brought to America to the influence of Christian teachings imposed on slaves in the new world. It charts the growth of independent black churches and attempts by slaves and free blacks  to unify the black community. Through the lives of two nineteenth-century black leaders, Sojourner Truth and Denmark Vesey, we see how religion and belief in God provided hope in the face of desperation. c2003. 120 min. <B> DVD 3055</B>



<DD><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><B>Episode two:</B> God is a Negro focuses on the role of Henry McNeal Turner, whose efforts to create a sense of self-respect among African-Americans began in the political arena and shifted to the religious realm. His emphasis on a black nationalist philosophy and his rejection of white power alienated him from some leaders, but led to a greater role for the black church in African-American culture. Turner's philosophy and teachings encouraged his followers to  find God from within, raising their opinions about themselves and all black people.  c2003. 120 min.  <B>DVD 3055</B>

Dorsey, two men a generation apart but united by a vision to take the stark reality of the streets into the church, challenging Christianity to be true to its promise of acceptance. In Chicago, Thomas Dorsey pioneers a different direction for spiritual expression: gospel music. In San Francisco, the Reverend Cecil Williams strives to pull down barriers with his "come as you are" church. Through their efforts, Dorsey, Williams and others create a new faith and a new music.  c2003. 120 min.  <B>DVD 3055</B>

Faith gave black families a way of insulating themselves from the oppression of segregation in the 1940s and 1950s, and provided the seeds for opposition to Jim Crow. Many of the protests of the 1960s are shown from the perspective of Prathia Hall, an eminent black preacher who was born in 1940 and literally grew up with the movement. Hall is one of many voices in the film--voices of ordinary people who, through faith, risk their lives to challenge America to live up to its promise of equality. c2003. 120 min.  <B>DVD 3055</B>
