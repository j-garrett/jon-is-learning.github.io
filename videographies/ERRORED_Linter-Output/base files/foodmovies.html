<p><dt><b>The Big Swallow</b> (1901)<dd>Williamson's Kinematograph Co. "One of the earliest of all British fantasy films is entitled The Big Swallow. Made around 1901 by James Williamson, it shows a gentleman infuriated to find himself being photographed, who advances on the camera, opens his mouth as wide as the screen - and swallows both camera and operator whole. If cinema itself is a kind of consumption, hoovering up reality and feeding it to us in bite-sized chunks, then it seems strange that so little attention has been paid to the filming of the food process."

<p><dt><b>Christmas in Connecticut</b>(1945)<dd>Directed by Peter Godfrey. Cast:
Barbara Stanwyck, Dennis Morgan, Sydney Greenstreet, Reginald Gardiner, S. Z. Sakall, Robert Shayne. "Smart housekeeping" columnist Elizabeth Lane's publisher, Sydney Greenstreet, invites himself and a handsome war hero to her fictitious Connecticut home for Christmas. Lane quickly rounds up a cottage, husband, baby and cook before the guests arrive, but real trouble begins when 'married' Lane begins to fall in love with engaged navy man Jones. Notable is the film's "delightful focus on food. Everyone seems to be either eating or talking about food here, from Jeff and his pal detailing the meals they can't wait to eat once they get out of the hospital, to the rotund Yardley's total dismissal of the concept of diet while at the farm, to Felix arguing over cooking and use of the farm's kitchen with the cook, Nora (Una O'Connor: Cavalcade). Christmas in Connecticut is so unrepentant and downright brazen in its love of food that it seems practically sinful from our point of view today, when denying the sensuous pleasures of food is supposedly a virtue."

<dt><b> Eat Drink Man Woman  (Yinshi nan nu)</b> (Taiwan / USA,1994)<dd>Directed by Ang Lee. "This film by director Ang Lee looks at the relationship between a Chinese widower and his three daughters. The main character, Chef Chu, is one of Taiwan's most respected chefs. An early scene shows him rushing to his restaurant to deal with a crisis during a wedding banquet for the Governor's of Taiwan's son. Only Chu is able to avert disaster. But while food has brought him status in the outside world, it fails to gain him the respect of his three grown daughters. Each Sunday he prepares an elaborate dinner, only to watch his daughters pick dispiritedly at the food. Food is used to demonstrate the main themes of the film. Early on we learn the father has lost his taste for food, which symbolizes the fact that both father and daughters have lost their taste for life. Food is also used to illustrate the shift in values between generations - the opening scenes move from the father's extensive dinner preparations to one daughter's job at a fast food restaurant. But all turns out well in the end, as the father regains both his sense of taste and his passion for living, while his daughters all find love."

<dt><b>Felicia's Journey</b> (Canada / UK, 1996)<dd>Director, Atom Egoyan. Cast: Bob Hoskins, Elaine Cassidy, Arsinee Khanjian, Peter McDonald, Gerard McSorley. 
"Joseph... is a catering manager at a large factory where he is known only as Mr. Hilditch. He is passionate about his work, dedicated to providing people with good food prepared with care. Food is also important in his private life. Each night, the middle-aged bachelor cooks elaborate formal dinners for his solitary enjoyment, working from videotapes of a 1950s cooking show, meticulously adhering to the instructions of the glamorous French hostess. Using china, crystal and silver, he takes his meals in the formal dining room of his big house. Like his meals, Hilditch's home decor dates from the 1950s, as does the green Morris Minor he drives and the music he listens to." [from <a HREF="http://www.londonfoodfilmfiesta.co.uk/FILMMA~1/Felici~1.htm">londonfoodfiesta</a>] Hilditch befriends a young woman, Felicia, who has come to town searching for her boyfriend. She is attracted to the seemingly harmless and extremely helpful Hilditch, trusting him and entering his life, only to discover too late that she is not the first woman that he has taken in. 116 min.

The baker spies the rat, seizes a handful of dough, throws it at him, completely covering his body and sticking him fast to the barrel. The baker then begins making busts of different celebrities, such as Buffalo Bill, Admiral Schley, and others. It is marvelous to see how quickly a face is formed out of the pliable dough. Finally he makes a very comical Irishman with cocked hat, clay pipe, and Donegal whiskers. By one twist of the dough the Irishman's face is changed from a broad smile to an expression of disgust. Two Irish bakers now appear on the scene, seize the offender and dip him into a barrel of flour. When drawn out, he is completely covered with the white meal, but having filled his mouth with flour, he blows it into the eyes of the two bakers, who fall to the floor in a heap."<B> DVD 644; vhs 999:1021  </B>

<p><dt><b>How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman (Como Era Gostoso o Meu Franc&ecirc;s)</b> (Brazil, 1971) <dd>Directed Nelson Pereira dos Santos. In the coastal wilds of 16th-century Brazil, a French soldier is captured by a tribe of man-eating Indians. He strives to learn the ways of the tribe, hoping to figure out a way to avoid his prescribed fate of being the main course of a ceremonial dinner. "A Brazilian feature with modernist touches of the country's Cinea Novo movement (defined by Glauber Rochas' 1965 discussion of the "aesthetics of hunger"), this fictional yet ethnographically aspirational film steps back to the 1500s when the French and Portuguese battled over New World territory. When local Tupinamba Indians capture a French explorer, they set about preparing a ritualistic meal in which they will consume him, and thereby, according to legend, appropriate his strength. Cannibalism combats colonialism, although the historical accuracy of this practice within this tribe hasn't been verified. A charming work despite serious social and political themes."

Just north of London live Wendy, Andy, and their twenty-something twins, Natalie and Nicola. Wendy clerks in a shop, leads aerobics at a primary school, jokes like a vaudevillian, agrees to waitress at a friend's new restaurant and dotes on Andy, a cook who forever puts off home remodeling projects, and with a drunken friend, buys a broken down lunch wagon. Natalie, with short neat hair and a snappy, droll manner, is a plumber; she has a holiday planned in America, but little else. Last is Nicola, odd man out: a snarl, big glasses, cigarette, mussed hair, jittery fingers, bulimic, jobless, and unhappy.

<dt><b>The Adventurer </b>(1917)<dd>Director, Charlie Chaplin. "Chaplin plays an escaped convict  who  by rescuing rich people ends up mingling with a class of society he is unprepared for.  When served ice cream the Tramp acts according to experience and treats the glass bowl as he would a cone.  When the Tramp attempts to mimic his companion's proper use of the spoon it results in the ice cream's ending up down his pants, a mistake that literally (and humorously) cools off any of the lower class man's unspeakable desires."

"Sumptuous" doesn't do this film justice. Martin Scorsese's adaptation of Wharton's novel about 1870s high society and its discontents is so aesthetically stuffed, it's positively gushing, and that goes for the food, too, as the banquets brim with historically accurate cuisine. But it's the rigid social norms reflected in the precisely choreographed table manners that counter the seemingly joyous abundance and epitomize this story of agonized restraint."

 <p><dt><b>Alice Adams</b> (1935) <dd>Directed by George Stevens. Cast: Katharine Hepburn, Fred MacMurray, Fred Stone, Evelyn Venable, Hattie McDaniel. Social climber Alice tries to push her clodhopper family to the background and assumes airs to win the love of an amiable, wealthy young man. In this tender comedy of Americana and manners each must overcome the obstacles of their backgrounds for their love to flourish.<p>"The highlight of the film is the classic, tragically funny, disastrous dinner-party scene. The aspiring, pretentious Alice hopelessly wishes to rise up above the low-social prominence of her vulgar, poor family. To impress Arthur, her rich new suitor, she has planned a "stylish" dinner party at her own home - in the wilting humidity and heat - she fiercely wishes to make a good impression by having conned Arthur into believing that her folks are well-to-do. She has fictionalized her life to him and forced everyone in her family to pretend that they are something other than themselves."

<dt><b>Annie Hall</b> (1977)<dd>Directed by Woody Allen, Cast: Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Tony Roberts, Carol Kane, Paul Simon. A romantic and sensitive comedy revolving around the diverse and diverting relationships of two nervous New Yorkers, Alvie Singer and Annie Hall.<p><p>"...in the film's pivotal scene that comments upon the wide, alienating divide between their two families, [Alvie has] the opportunity to meet her [Annie's] WASP-ish Protestant family at Easter sharing a traditional ham dinner, a meal which he should be avoiding as a traditional Jew. At the table, he is so paranoid about her parents that he has a flash transformation, imagining that they see him as a bearded orthodox Hasidic rabbi - with a reddish beard, a black hat and coat. Alvy tells Mom Hall (Colleen Dewhurst) about the results of his fifteen years of analysis: "I'm making excellent progress. Pretty soon, when I lie down on his couch, I won't have to wear the lobster bib." Nobody laughs at Alvy's joke. It is clear that Annie's mother, father and bigoted Grammy Hall don't approve of him. <p>In a split-screen to illustrate the two incompatible worlds, Alvy's New York Jewish family is compared in a similar dinner scene to Annie's family. On the left third of the screen is the brightly lit, affluent, politely gracious, aloof and sober Hall family discussing subjects such as the Christmas play and the 4-H Club. On the right two-thirds of the screen is a darkly lit, sloppy and informal, noisily argumentative, competitively babbling, neurotic Singer family talking about illness (diabetes, heart disease) and unemployment."

"The best opening credits of the 1999 summer movie season belonged to this outrageous sequel, in which the titles flash while breads, meats, and produce are strategically placed in front of characters' naked physiques. This several-minute buffet of visual puns includes melons held in front of breasts, a male groin hidden by a salami, and a baked ham to mask the bum of cheeky Agent Powers (Mike Myers). Juvenile, certainly, but brilliantly styled and true to the tendency to analogize food with "naughty bit" body parts. Do I make you hungry, baby?"

He meets a fifteen-year-old waif and the friendship that develops allows the young man's passion for food to be assuaged by the girl's grandmother, the wielder of a magic wok.

Charlie is an overworked labourer at a film studio who helps a young woman find work even while his coworkers strike against his tyrannical boss. A satire of life at a silent movie studio, a thinly veiled satire of Mack Sennett's Keystone Company.  In one scene, Charlie is on a lunch break with fellow stagehands, but without a lunch. "One stagehand has spread out a great stack of sandwhiches before him, another has unwrapped the remains of a leg of beef, while another has brought a large bunch of green onions. In the midst of this cornucopia, Charlie sits wistfully, but with two empty slices of bread, trying to determine the best way to snitch a bite of beef from the end of the bone, or to steal a sandwhich from the pile, while avoiding the onions."

To count the days, #223 buys cans of pineapple (May's favorite) with 1 May expiration dates. When the day comes and May doesn't call, he gorges himself on 30 cans of pineapple, calls up (and gets rejected by) every girl he's known since grade school and gets completely wasted. He goes to a bar and decides to fall in love with the next woman he sees and that lucky woman turns out to be a mysterious, blonde wigged drug dealer (Brigitte Lin Ching-Hsia). #223 sees her across the bar and, with much confidence, tries to chat her up because he has the *perfect* opening line, 'Hello, do you like pineapple?'"

"A parody of the spate of contemporary black urban ghetto films distributed in the late eighties and early nineties. The Wayans brothers tackle the elements of these films that became distracting clich&eacute;s, such as the unhealthy, low-price food the characters eat. In one particularly extreme and repulsive scene (that also parodies 9-1/2 Weeks), the "crack mother" has a food fight/sexual encounter with her lover on her kitchen floor. They slather themselves with the refrigerator's contents, including huge bricks of orange cheddar cheese, packaged meat products, condiments, and beer."

In their hunt for a sex criminal known as the Necktie Murderer, the London police suspect an innocent man, who eludes them and proves his innocence by finding the real murderer. "Hitchcock's second-to-last film, generally regarded as limping through a routine: mistaken identity, a killer on the loose, and a female blonde. But adding to this story of a London sex killer is a little bit of spice in the form of food: Much of the film takes place in an outdoor market and in pubs, and the suspected killer (but not the actual one) is constantly avoiding his wife's inedible gourmet meals while he himself tries to find the "Necktie Murderer." And the body that incriminates the killer is stuffed in a sack of potatoes, and it's in a stack of them that a final wrestling match ensues. Sex, food, death-Hitch merely simplified things."

The Corleone Family nearly falls from power in America  but rises to observe the passage of rites from father to son.  There is a balance between family life and the ugly business of crime in which they are engaged. Throughout this saga, food and eating figure largely as both cultural signifiers and narrative devices.  One of the most-often quoted lines in the film is hitman Peter Clemenza's admonishion  to his colleague in crime, Rocco Lampone:   "Leave the gun. Take the cannoli."    Other examples abound:   Frankie Pentangeli (an old-time gangster) to Vito Corleone's son, Fredo:   "Hey, what's with the food around here?...A kid comes up to me in a white jacket, gives me a Ritz cracker, and uh, chopped liver, he says, 'Canapes.'

 <p><dt><b>The Gold Rush</b> (1925)<dd>Directed by Charlie Chaplin; Cast: Charlie Chaplin, Mack Swain, Tom Murray, Henry Bergman, Malcolm Waite, Georgia Hale. Classic Chaplin (the Little Tramp) prospects for gold, gets involved with a dance hall girl, and deals with a burly competitor during the Yukon gold rush. This is the 1942 re-release version with music and narration by Chaplin and intertitles deleted.<p> The Gold Rush features one of the most memorable food scenes in movie history: "Inside the cabin meanwhile, hungry and desperate, the Tramp and Big Jim celebrate "Thanksgiving Dinner," in a famous, classic feast/meal scene. The Tramp and Big Jim are reduced to starvation, so the Tramp resorts to boiling and cooking a tasty dinner for them. He chooses one of his boots as the object of their Thanksgiving dinner, taking on airs as a gourmet at a feast. He watches it cooking on the stove until perfectly simmered. He then carves the boot (splitting and cutting it like a filet), and offers the upper part to Big Jim. He pours water over it like gravy. He chews on the lower sole part, treating it like a delicacy, and he twirls the laces like spaghetti. He daintily sucks the nails, like they were the bones of a game bird, or small fishbones. Indifferent to his comrades plight, Black Larsen stumbles on the claim of Big Jim McKay," while the two of them still wait for relief. Because they have eaten his boot, and he only has rags for clothes, the Tramp must now sit with his foot in the oven to keep warm. When starvation strikes again, Jim suffers more "food" hallucinations, and crazily imagines the Tramp transformed into a giant, plump chicken, ripe for slaughter. He chases his appetizing friend with a gun and later with an axe. The panic-stricken Tramp defends himself with the shot-gun in a hand-to-hand struggle with Jim. A hungry passing bear wanders into the cabin and gets involved in the struggle. The Tramp aims and kills it as it runs off, solving their food problem."

 <p> <dt><b>Goodfellas</b> (1990)<dd> Directed by Martin Scorsese; starring Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Brocco, Paul Sorvino. <p> "Deeply disturbing images of food are not the only feature of contemporary cinema's cuisine. Meals, for instance, play an unusually dramatic part in many of Martin Scorsese's films. In Goodfellas, a brutal mafia killing is followed by an alarmingly normal Italian-style meal, served by the director's own mother, Catherine Scorsese. And one of the most sensuous and simultaneously menacing of all food images in modern cinema occurs during a prison scene, as the mafiosi prepare their ritual pasta sauce. The boss (Paul Sorvino), we learn in voice-over, while seeing a massive close-up of chubby fingers at work, 'had this wonderful system for doing the garlic. He used a razor and he used to slice it so thin that it used to liquefy in the pan.' Later, the central figure's drug-fuelled paranoia is signalled by his obsession with the meatballs and tomato sauce he's cooking as the FBI move in. 'Keep and eye on the sauce and watch the helicopters', is almost his last order before the Feds arrive. Throughout Goodfellas, the exacting domesticity of Italian cuisine serves to highlight the terrifying normality of these mobsters."

<dt><b>Hamam (The Turkish Bath)</b>(Italy / Turkey / Spain, 1997)<dd>Director, Ferzan Ozpetek.  Francesco, a successful designer from Rome, arrives in Istanbul to dispose of an inheritance left him by an aunt he never knew. Once there he discovers that the property is a hamam, a traditional Turkish steam bath.  Mehmet, the beautiful son of the hamam's custodian, ushers Francesco into the sultry world of the baths. Enlightened and unbound, Francesco decides to remain in Istanbul and restore the hamam.  "Exquisitely constructed with sensual imagery, mouthwatering meals and tantalizing rhythms, Hamam (Steam) proffers a view into the ethereal mecca that is Istanbul, interweaving the stories of two people who found it necessary to escape and re-invent their lives. ...Ozpetek is a sensitive director. He takes his time. He doesn't rush. He allows the natural rhythms to settle and pays particular attention to food."

<dt><b>The Immigrant </b>(1917)<dd>Director, Charlie Chaplin. "In The Immigrant, released June 17, 1917, the Tramparrives in the "land of liberty" on a boat full of immigrants, finds money, and then tries to eat in a restaurant. The first exchange in the restaurant revolves around the Tramp's confusion over the social convention of removing one's hat at the dinner table--something that is utterly lost when the waiter attempts to politely remind the Tramp of his impropriety. Their comic exchange is based upon a fundamental miscommunication: the Tramp is hungry and wants food, the waiter simply wants the Tramp to behave in a fashion befitting a public
dining room. Upon eventually receiving his class-marked serving of beans...the Tramp proceeds to eat them one by one until he succumbs to his hunger and begins to shovel the beans into his mouth. The gag is humorous precisely because the spectator intuits the irony of the Tramp's hunger in conflict with the restaurants middle class conventions. His attempts at genteel behavior are thus thwarted by his visceral needs; he is hungry, not attempting to fit into the social conventions of public food consumption."

more dramatic moments take place either in the kitchen or at the dinner table. In one classic scene,
the boyfriend of one of the daughters inadvertently insults his future mother-in-law when he agrees that
a dish she has prepared tastes too salty. To make matters worse, he proceeds to douse his food in soy
sauce. Most of the time food does not play that major a role, but it is nearly always present in the
background." [from Rhonda Parkinson's<a HREF="http://chinesefood.about.com/library/weekly/aa032400a.htm">Chinese Food in the Movies</a>] <B>DVD 3151; vhs 999:1042</B>

A bemused would-be poet gets himself entangled with an unctuous cemetery entrepreneur, a mom-obsessed mortician and other bizarre characters. "Not every treatment of cuisine on screen emphasizes the beauty of the food. The extremes twist our view of food and manage to disgust us. Take Richard Lester's fine adaptation of the Evelyn Waugh satire The Loved One. Not everything in the movie works equally well, but the wonderfully disgusting portrait of Mr. Joy Boy serving his obese mother an endless parade of food is a passionate cinema food treatise   delivered with the greatest of gourmand gracelessness.  Mr. Joy Boy dances around his mother with tiny temptations like whole roast turkeys and Rod Steiger has a field day as the mortician whose mother lays transfixed by television commercials coddled comfortably in the layers of her own fat. When Steiger dances in to his mother's comfortable bed dining position singing Momma's Little Joy Boy loves cookin, cookin, it's the height of gourmandize bad taste.

<dt><b> Moonstruck</b>(1987)<dd>Directed by Norman Jewison; Cast: Cher, Nicolas Cage, Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Gardenia, Danny Aiello. Loretta Castorini (Cher), a beautiful soon-to-be-wed Italian widow has the misfortune to meet--and fall hopelessly in love with--her fiancee's estranged brother in this sophisticated romantic comedy about the loves, jealousies, and entanglements facing an Italian-American family in Brooklyn. 103 min. <B>DVD X367 </B>


<p>
Moonstruck is a film that uses food and food sharing as the focal point for a great many scenes. Much of the action takes place in the Grand Ticino restaurant, the family grocery store, the bakery, the family's dining room, or the kitchen. Food is used as a means of conveying family relationships, ethnicity, and the changing moods of the characters. At one point, Rose (Dukakis), the family matriarch, confronts her doddering father-in-law at the dinner table: "Feed one more bite of my food to your dogs, old man, and I'll kick you to death!").  The climatic scene takes place in the large, Castorini family kitchen. With the extended family assembled, Loretta confronts her feckless fiancee (Aiello), and Ronnie (Cage) proposes to her. In the scene, food is used as a comic anchoring device that brings the family together, and drink serves as the introduction to a romantic and joyous finale.

<dt><b>My Big Fat Greek Wedding</b> (2002)<dd>Directed by Joel Zwick. Cast: Nia Vardalos, John Corbett, Lainie Kazan, Michael Constantine, Gia Carides, Louis Mandylor, Bess Meisler, Andrea Martin, Joey Fantone. Toula is a quiet, devoted daughter in a big, crazy Greek family. "Toula Portokalos ruefully comments that like all Greek women, she was put upon this earth for three purposes: to marry a Greek man, to have Greek children, and to feed everyone until the day she dies. When she defies two of these expectations by falling in love Ian Miller, a WASP vegetarian, neither the couple nor their families can quite comprehend the eating habits of the other's culture. At the wedding reception Toula's father, who specialized in finding the Greek root of any word, declares that "Miller" comes from the Greek word for apple, and "Portokalos" is based on the Greek word for oranges--and so "in the end we're all fruits.'"

<p><dt><b>Ordinary People</b> (1980)<dd>Directed by Robert Redford. Cast: Donald Sutherland, Mary Tyler Moore, Judd Hirsch, Timothy Hutton. The "ordinary" existence of an upper middle class family is shattered with the death of the elder son in a boating accident and the struggle of the younger son against suicide and guilt left by the drowning. <p>

"One of the most powerful examples of this 'dysfunctional family' dining experience is Ordinary People, a film which...includes scenes of food throughout. So many scenes take place in the dining room or the kitchen of the Jarett home that we begin to see these rooms as the 'heart' of the family organism in this film. And, by the end of the film, they will represent a broken heart."  [Boswell, Parley Ann. "Hungry in the Land of Plenty: Food in Hollywood Films."

<dt><b>Pay Day</b> (1922)<dd>Directed by Charles Chaplin. A humble working man is confused about the amount of his paycheck and how to keep it away from his wife. In one scene, a fellow worker  places his lunch on an elevator just as it comes back down. As soon as he lets go the elevator goes next to the hungry, lunch-less Charlie. Charlie takes the contents out which are a BIG loaf of bread and a sausage. He drills a hole in the bread and stuffs the sausage in. The loaf is too big so he takes a corkscrew and pulls out the sausage. He puts the bread down on the elevator and pulls the sausage off the corkscrew. The elevator goes down with the bread and the original owner of the sandwich takes it.     26 min. <b>DVD 235</b>

<dt><b>Playtime</b> (France / Italy, 1967)<dd>Directed by Jacques Tati. A group of American tourists arrive in Paris, only to find that the city is indistinguishable from any other big city. Endless comedies ensue however, when the path of Monsieur Hulot (Tati) crosses that of the group. "The last long sequence in the film involves the opening night of a restaurant at which everything goes wrong, and the more it goes wrong, the more the customers are able to relax and enjoy themselves. The sequence involves a multitude of running jokes, which simultaneously unfold at all distances from the camera; the only stable reference point is supplied by a waiter who rips his pants on the modern chairs and goes to hide behind a pillar. There he is implored by other waiters to lend them his clean towel, his untorn jacket, his shoes and his bowtie, until finally he is a complete mess, an exhibit of haberdashery mishaps."

"A hooker with a heart of gold but the table manners and palate sophistication of a six-year-old, this Cinderella story, like many, includes gourmandizing and dining etiquette as part of the female domestication process. Here, Vivian (Julia Roberts) learns that in the upper class, strawberries are served with champagne and meant to be savored, not devoured, and a business lunch may involve strange foods and copious utensils. Still, in this fairy tale that celebrates respectability while decrying wealthy pretension, Vivian's fumbles make her exceedingly sympathetic and almost worthy of the worship."

<dt><b>The Public Enemy</b>(1931)<dd>Directed by William A. Wellman. Cast: James Cagney, Jean Harlow, Edward Woods, Joan Blondell. Tom Powers (Cagney) begins his life of crime at an early age with his companion Matt Doyle. Powers' eventual  rise to a notorious prohibition  gangster is only darkened when a rival gang brutally murders his childhood friend. Powers tries to avenge Doyle's death but his efforts lead to a chilling and savage conclusion. 
"In one of the most vividly remembered and vicious scenes in film history, the breakfast scene in Tom's apartment the next morning, he walks sleepily to the breakfast table in his striped pajamas. He is in a foul mood, bored, grouchy and irritable after a demanding phone conversation with Nails Nathan. (Matt and Mamie can be heard dallying in bed in the adjoining room.) In contrast, Tom has grown tired of his relationship with moll girlfriend Kitty. At the table, she greets him without a smile. He asks her for a beer for breakfast and she talks back:
<p>
    <B>Tom</B>: Ain't you got a drink in the house?
    <BR><B>Kitty</B>: Well, not before breakfast, dear.
    <BR><B>Tom</B>: I didn't ask you for any lip. I asked you if you had a drink.
    <BR><B>Kitty</B>: I know, Tom, but I-I wish that...
    <BR><B>Tom</B>: There you go with that wishin' stuff again. I wish you was a wishing well, so that I could tie a bucket to ya and sink ya.
    <BR><B>Kitty</B>: (provokingly) Maybe you've found someone you like better.





<p>
He looks down, makes a nasty grimace, and then impulsively picks up a grapefruit half from his plate and contemptuously pushes it into her face to end their relationship. She looks down, physically and painfully hurt and emotionally embarrassed by his crudeness. It is one of the single-most cruel acts ever depicted in a film. His life of crime has made him cruel and hardened." [from <a HREF="http://www.filmsite.org/publ2.html">Tim Dirks' FilmSite</a>] 84 min. <b>DVD 3514; vhs 999:33</b>

The story of an Brooklyn store clerk who is an Italian American Saturday night disco king; he begins to question the narrowness of his perspective when he meets a girl who is shedding her origins for a more sophisticated lifestyle. <p>

"Tony Manera (Travolta) arrives home from his job at the paint store in time to primp before his mirror and have dinner with his family before he joins his friends for a night of dancing. Before he begins to eat, he dons a bib so that he won't drip spaghetti on his good shirt. We notice this gesture, but his family seems otherwise occupied; they are busy fighting with each other as they fill their plates with food. Tony's father is angry with everyone because he has lost his job, and Tony's mother has bought food too expensive for their budget. When Tony serves himself two pork chops, his father slaps him across the face. Before this meal is over, several members of Tony's family will have left the table in anger, and ultimately, several will either have slapped someone or will have been slapped."

"Julie Taymor's striking Shakespearean adaptation Titus is far from a food movie. While the bloodbath of revenge dominates the horrific vision, Taymor's imagination does conjure up some demented displays of food. The coronation feast is an sumptuously overripe  vision of excess. But the food highlight comes as Titus himself plays mad baker dancing around the table with the addled glee of a Pillsbury poster boy while serving a memorably disgusting concoction."

Tom Jones is an orphan raised by the village squire who grows up to be a handsome young man with a way with women. He loves the daughter of a neighboring landowner, and falls into many adventures in pursuit of her, including duels, bedroom romps and prison! <p>Features "one of the most memorable demonstrations of the link between food and sex ever committed to celluloid, giving new meaning to the term "human appetite." The famous, sex-drenched eating scene between Tom (Albert Finney) and, (all unknowingly) possibly his mother Mrs. Waters (Joyce Redman) begins naturally enough with big steaming pewter bowls of soup, whereat Mrs. Waters leans well over the table and lustily slurps big round spoonsful, breasts tumbling out of her bodice, with a more-than-come-hither look. Tom, nearly overcome, involuntarily rips a claw off the langouste he has in his hand and sucks happily on it. Drafts of ale, turkey, oysters, pears, and wine are then dispatched with loving attention."

<dt><b>Walkabout </b> (UK, 1982)<dd>Directed by Nicolas Roeg; Cast: Jenny Agutter, Lucien John [i.e, Luc Roeg], David Gumpilil [i.e., Gulpilil], John Meillon. Stranded in the Australian desert two city children, an English girl and her small brother, are rescued by an Aborigine boy who has journeyed into the outback on his "walkabout"--a tribal initiation into manhood. <P>

"Walkabout is about many things but one of its main themes for me is that of wastage. This is shown throughout the film. The aboriginal boy uses every part of the animals that he kills ? the meat for food, the sinews for cord, and even the fluids for the treatment of sunburn. By contrast, white man is shown to be very wasteful of the things he kills and sometimes he kills for no other purpose than sport. These conflicting approaches are shown in a non-didactic fashion, simply by cutting between the aboriginal boy preparing food and the white man?s methods, and it is left to the audience to make its own judgements. The way food is ?sanitized? in white culture is also explored. When the aboriginal boy serves up possum to the girl and boy, it still looks very much like a possum. By contrast, the steak that finally ends up on the dinner plates of white suburban houses looks far removed from the cows that it originally was."

<p><dt><b>When Harry Met Sally</b>(1989)<dd>Directed by Rob Reiner. Cast: Billy Crystal, Meg Ryan, Carrie Fisher, Bruno Kirby.  "Reiner's hopelessly romantic comedy about a man (Billy Crystal) and woman (Meg Ryan) who can't stop running into each other and assessing their compatibility or lack thereof. Lots of dining and food-related events bring them into contact, including a deli where Sally famously fakes an orgasm, which not only relieves their denied sexual tension but endears her to a neighboring patron (played by director Reiner's mom)."
