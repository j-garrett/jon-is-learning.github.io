Documentary about Unit 731, Japan's secret World War II biological and chemical weapons facility in the Chinese town of Harbin where biological weapons were developed during the Japanese Occupation.

The second half, using almost the exact same footage, describes Unit 731 from the Japanese revisionist perspective which is largely supported by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in Japan. Although its cruel experiments on living people produced thousands of casualties, this activity is still denied by a number of Japanese historians and politicians. A film by James T. Hong.  2007.  <B>DVD X351</B>

China's women have always been under pressure: from men, from family, from work.

It's a slow, difficult process, and it is changing China.

<DD><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border=0><B>Freedom and Justice.</B> This fourth segment looks at freedom in China examining such questions as: How free are the Chinese people? How free to worship as they please? To learn the truth from the media? To hear the truth from the Communist Party and the government? How can people with a grievance negotiate with the state? Also looks at popular grievances: forced evictions, government cover-up of the AIDS problem, corruption and land grabbing. There were 87,000 officially-recognized cases of public disorder in 2005. The courts frequently refuse to take on sensitive cases, forcing ordinary people to petition the government -- a frustratingly ineffectual process. The cameras go inside a "Re-education through Labor" camp to which women are committed without trial for up to four years for drugs, sex or property offences -- or for petitioning.

<B>Part 1: Getting Rich: The Quest for Wealth in China</B><DD>By embracing private enterprise, China has achieved the most rapid economic advance in history. But how much of its success is founded on the abuse and exploitation of workers? This program examines the rise of China’s upper class, looking at new philosophies and business tactics that have created millionaires and billionaires in a once-collectivist society. Viewers are introduced to Zuo Zongshen, owner of the Zongshen Industrial Group and one of the richest men in China—as well as two of his factory employees, among the estimated 100 million Chinese who have left rural villages for low-wage urban jobs. Also studied: the nation’s alarming rise in workplace injuries and its booming dot-com industry. A Discovery Channel Production.
