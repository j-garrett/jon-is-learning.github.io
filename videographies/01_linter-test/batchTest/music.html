audiences in the issues of the 1960s and 70s. This biographical

followed his own vision, challenging himself and his listeners.

<p>In 1966, CBC Television invited some of North America's greatest
blues performers to gather in a studio in Toronto. The artists were
recorded together and individually in sessions that lasted three
days. The result was originally televised as part of the CBC
"Festival" series. Most of these artists are gone now, but 30 years
later, the session video tapes have been found, restored and
re-edited. Host, Canadian blues star, Colin James takes us on a

<dt><b>Bluesland: A Portrait in American Music.</b></dt>
<dd>This video explores the blues-- with all its poetic irony and
sly humor, its eroticism and timeless power. It traces its roots
from the beginning of the 20th Century through the Mississippi
Delta to Louisiana, Texas, Kansas City and Chicago. Features Son
House, Leadbelly, Big Bill Broonzy, Bessie Smith, Count Basie,
Louis Jordan, Jimmy Rushing, T-Bone Walker, Big Joe Turner, Sonny
Boy Williamson, Muddy Waters, Dinah Washington, Louis Armstrong,
Duke Ellington, Chuck Berry and many others.</dd>
</dl>
<p>"In a dizzying 85 minutes, Bluesland barnstorms through a
century of blues, south and north, stopping briefly along the way
to tip a musical hat to legendary heros, heroines and their
progeny--from Charley Patton to Muddy Waters, from Jelly Roll
Morton to Ellington, from T-Bone Walker to the Stones. While some
attempt is made to provide a social and cultural context for the
music, Bluesland revels most in the blues as a hugely influencial
show biz phenomenon. Despite its tendency toward the perfunctory,
it's a consistently high-spirited romp, presented through a
collection of terrific archival photos and clips, and an
entertainly slick narrative." (Review by G. Handman from

fascinating sampler of seminal rural and urban blues
styles--interviews and performances captured in their entirety, in
the manner of an ethnographic field recording. The primitive drive

Technicolor.</b></dt>
<dd>Crossroads traces the blues which changed the sound of rock and
roll, from the Mississippi Delta to Chicago to the UK, where this
earthy rich sound inspired a host of young British musicians bored

Richards and Bill Wyman of the Rolling Stones and Jeff Beck tell
how their hits introduced American rock fans to their own
indigenous blues masters, like Howlin' Wolf and John Lee Hooker.
Blues in Technicolor takes viewers on a trip into the psychedelic
rock world of the late 60's and early 70's. Using interviews with
the Byrds, Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane and Pink Floyd, this
film shows how a bohemian folk culture based in San Francisco set
off an international explosion of musical experimentation and
eclecticism--much of it drug-inspired. <b>Video/C 4160</b></dd>

of the Depression new dances, the Lindy Hop and Swing, caught on at
the dance halls of New York even as the jobless lined the streets
and drought ruined Midwest farms. Jazz, during 1929 through 1935,
lifted the nation's spirit. Record sales boomed while Armstrong
became a major entertainer as singer, trumpeter, band leader, radio
and film performer. Ellington's elegance, compositions, brilliant
band films and recordings created a huge following in America and
abroad. This segment also visits the careers of Fletcher Henderson,
Benny Goodman, Billy Rose, Chick Webb, Fats Waller, Art Tatum and

hailed as the "King of Swing" and becomes the first white
bandleader to hire black musicians. He has a host or rivals among
them, Chick Webb, Tommy Dorsey, Jimmie Lunceford, Glen Miller and
Artie Shaw. Louis Armstrong heads a big band of his own, while Duke
Ellington continues his independent course, but great black artists
still can't eat or sleep in many of the hotels where they perform.
Billie Holiday emerges from a childhood of tragedy to begin her

Young. Young migrates to Kansas City, where a vibrant music scene
is prospering with musicians such as trumpeter Harry "Sweets"
Edison and drummers Jo Jones and Chick Webb. Out of this ferment
emerges pianist Count Basie, who forms a band that epitomizes the
Kansas City sound. Billie Holiday cuts recordings while other women
musicians, including pianist Mary Lou Williams and singer Ella

WWII in 1941, swing becomes a symbol of democracy and entertainers
like Dave Brubeck, Glenn Miller and Artie Shaw take their music to
the armed forces overseas. In New York Billie Holiday is unofficial
queen despite a growing addiction to narcotics. Duke Ellington,
assisted by the gifted young arranger, Billy Strayhorn, brings his
music to ever-greater heights. After dark a small underground of
gifted young musicians led by the trumpet virtuoso Dizzy Gillespie
and saxophonists Charlie Parker and Ben Webster begin to develop a
new fast and intricate way of playing, developing a new music
called bebop. Meanwhile in 1945, black soldiers return home to the
same racism they fought against, and a growing unrest sets the
seeds for future rebellions. <b>DVD 494</b></dd>

Ellington keeps his band together, while Louis Armstrong puts
together a small group, the "All-Stars." Promoter Norman Granz
insists on equal treatment for every member of his integrated
troupes on his Jazz at the Philharmonic Tours. Meanwhile, bebop
musicians Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker are creating some of
the most inventive jazz ever played but a devastating narcotics
plague sweeps through the jazz community, ruining lives and
changing the dynamics of performance. And a number of great
performers including Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, Gerry Mulligan,

condemns the government for its failure to act on racism in Little
Rock, Ark. Drummer Art Blakely and others attempt to win back

jazz fragments into the avant-garde and many divided schools of
thought. Many jazz musicians like Dexter Gordon are forced to leave
America in search of work while others use the music as a form of
social protest: Max Roach, Charles Mingus, and Archie Shepp make
overtly political musical statements. John Coltrane appeals to a
broad audience before his untimely death. Saxophonist Stan Getz
helps boost a craze for bossa nova music, but in the early 1970s
jazz founders Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington pass away. Miles
Davis leads a movement of jazz musicians who incorporate elements
of rock and soul into their music and "fusion" wins listeners. By
the mid-1980's jazz begins to bounce back led by Wynton Marsalis
and a new generation of musicians. Now as it approaches its
centennial, jazz is still alive, still changing and still swinging.

<dt><b>Jazz: Rhythms of Freedom</b></dt>
<dd>A history of jazz, the unique American musical art form rooted
in slave songs, which originated in New Orleans in the early 1910s.
From New Orleans Dixieland, the music spawned a variety of
subgenres; big band-style swing in the 1930s and 1940s, bebop in
the mid-1940s, Latin jazz fusions in the 1950s to the freedom music
of the 1960s. Jazz, which began in America giving voice to the
disenfranchized, has spread around the world to become a way of
liberation through music, its aesthetics being adapted to its
varied environments and giving rise to many distinctive styles.

canceling the concert might trigger a riot. The mayor relented and
then persuaded PBS station WGHB to broadcast the event in an effort

of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and delivered an electrifying

<dt><b>[Brown, James] The Night James Brown Saved Boston</b></dt>
<dd>In the days following the assassination of Dr Martin Luther
King, America's cities burnt with rage as riots and mass
destruction of property broke out. On the 5th April 1968, James
Brown performed at the Garden. The decision was taken to televise
the concert for all to see, with the goal of not only keeping
people in their homes but also giving the Mayor the opportunity to
present a message of peace and unity. This documentary looks back
at this moment in rock history, looking at the politics behind the
scenes, the money issues and the various personalities involved.
The remainder of the film goes on to look at the significance of
Brown generally thereafter; who he threw his name behind
politically, the power he had to influence the African American
community. Contents: Trouble in paradise -- Mr. Brown and Dr. King
-- Welcome to Boston -- It was a very bad year -- Two arrogant men
-- Mr. Dynamite keeps Boston from exploding -- Find James Brown --

<dt><b>Blacking Up: Hip-hop's Remix of Race and Identity</b></dt>
<dd>This documentary examines the popularity of hip-hop among
America's white youth and asks whether white identification is
rooted in admiration and a desire to transcend race or if it is
merely a new chapter in the long continuum of stereotyping, mimicry
and cultural appropriation. Does it reflect a new face of racial
understanding in white America or does it reinforce an ugly
history? Against the unique backdrop of american popular music, the
film explores racial identity in the United States. The film draws
parallels between the white hip-hop fan and previous incarnations
of white appropriation from blackface performer Al Jolson to
mainstream artists like Elvis Presley, the Rolling Stones and
Eminem. It interweaves portraits of white hip-hop artists and fans
with insightful commentary by African American cultural critics.

La Soul began reusing portions of previously recorded music for

<dt><b>DJ QBert's Wave Twisters</b></dt>
<dd>Plot: A crew of heroes, cleverly disguised as a team of oral
hygenists, is determined to save the lost arts of Hip Hop
(B-boying, Graffiti, MCing, and of course, Skratching) from total
extinction. The lost arts are being oppressed throughout
inner-space by lord Ook and his evil minions the Chinheads. The
dental commander and his team, armed with the ancient relic known
as the Wave Twister (the only weapon powerful enough to defeat the
enemies), travel to the far ends of inner-space for a final
confrontation with the sinister army of oppressors. Technique: An
animated adventure cartoon synched scratch for scratch with DJ
QBert's turntable masterpiece of the same title. This movie gives
visual expression to QBert's narrative while pioneering the concept
of visual scratching, sampling from a wide variety of techniques
(from traditional cell animation to 3D to live action to photo
collage), and defining a unique visual style analogous to the
supercharged cutting and scratching of a turntable DJ. Special
features: Commentary track with creators; Film-to-animatic
comparisons; Behind-the-scenes featurette; Theatrical trailers for

<dt><b>Saz</b></dt>
<dd>This provocative documentary goes behind the ghetto walls of
Ramlah to look at a year in the life of budding Palestinian hip-hop
star Sameh Zakout a.k.a. Saz. Growing up in a Jewish neighborhood
as a third generation of a moderate family, Saz has had to learn to
balance their traditional viewpoints with his strong feelings of
insult and rage for the injustices his people have suffered. He
does this through music, using it as a starting point for
discussion with Israeli and Arab youth who have grown further apart
since the recent Intifada. For Saz, music is a place where people
who disagree can come together. It takes him to the clubs and
neighborhoods of Tel Aviv, Haifa, and London. The film also looks
at his relationship with his aging grandfather, a refugee of the
1948 war, whose conversations reveal their differing ideologies.

<b>Renegades</b>. Part 2: <b>In the Groove</b>. Summary:
<i>Renegades</i> travels southern backroads to New Orleans, Memphis
and Nashville then north to Chicago, interviewing Little Richard,
Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, pioneer disk jockey Hoss
Allen and producers Dave Bartholomew, Sam Phillips and Phil and
Marshall Chess along the way. These renegades of the 50's reveal
how they borrowed from rhythm and blues, country, gospel and jazz
to create a whole new sound--rock n roll. <i>In the Groove</i>
reports on the years between Elvis and the Beatles, when the hit
single became an intricately crafted work of art and producers,
songwriters and musicians created studio magic. In interviews with
Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, Ben E. King, Brian Wilson, Carole
King, Sonny Bono and Dick Dale among others, this film recounts the
era of sweet soul and girl groups when a new rock genius
reigned--the producer. <b>Video/C 4158</b></dd>

<i>Shakespeares in the Alley</i> looks at the towering influences
of Bob Dylan and the Beatles on rock and roll and "folk rock". This
film includes footage of performances by Dylan and the Beatles and
interviews with Beatles producer George Martin, Dylan musician Al
Kooper, Peter Yarrow of Peter, Paul and Mary, Roger McGuinn and
David Crosby of the Byrds and poet Allen Ginsberg. <b>Respect</b>
chronicles the transformation of black gospel music into a defining
sound for all Americans. On hand to tell the tale are Berry Gordy,
Ray Charles, Martha Reeves, Mary Wilson, Booker T. and the MG's,
Wilson Pickett, Maxine Powell of the Motown "Charm School", and

<b>Crossroads.</b>. Part 2: <b>Blues in Technicolor</b>.
<i>Crossroads</i> traces the blues which changed the sound of rock
and roll, from the Mississippi Delta to Chicago to the UK, where
this earthy rich sound inspired a host of young British musicians
bored with the pop music of the day. Eric Clapton, John Mayall,
Keith Richards and Bill Wyman of the Rolling Stones and Jeff Beck
tell how their hits introduced American rock fans to their own
indigenous blues masters, like Howlin' Wolf and John Lee Hooker.
<i>Blues in Technicolor</i> takes viewers on a trip into the
psychedelic rock world of the late 60's and early 70's. Using
interviews with the Byrds, Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane and
Pink Floyd, this film shows how a bohemian folk culture based in
San Francisco set off an international explosion of musical
experimentation and eclecticism--much of it drug-inspired.

York, Detroit and Berlin with the Door's Ray Manzarek and producer
Paul Rothchild, Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, David Bowie, Alice Cooper and
Kiss' Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. In <i>Make it Funky</i> soul
music stretches to create a rock n' roll revolution in rhythm and
attitude in the '70's. Innovators James Brown, Sly and the Family
Stone, George Clinton and bass players Larry Graham and Bootsy
Collins take viewers on a tour of funk as the music becomes bolder
and more expressive of the realities of black life. Filmed in New

two late 70's musical innovations: punk and reggae. In New York,
members of Blondie, Talking Heads, Television and the Ramones tell
how they inadvertently created the cynical, urban sound that became
punk rock. In London, punk takes off with the Sex Pistols, and
members of the Wailers and the Clash) recall how Jamaican reggae
crossed international boundaries, deeply influencing punk and pop
rock. <i>The Perfect Beat</i> begins at a time when megastars like
Bruce Springsteen, and Metallica filled arenas around the world and
moves on to chronicle the rise of a new musical form: rap. From
Grandmaster Flash to Run-DMC, from De La Soul to British innovators
New Order to the Beastie Boys, the program traces the evolution of
this new sound in the 80's and early 90's. Film shows how
superstars like Madonna and Prince folded rap, techno and house,
into their music, and how MTV ultimately embraced it. <b>Video/C

<dt><b>Rockin' the Wall</b></dt>
<dd>When the Berlin Wall went up in 1960, it became the worldwide
symbol of communist oppression. While the Wall kept people in, it
could not keep Western influences like rock music out. Through
Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, rock music penetrated the
Iron Curtain with messages of freedom and rebellion. This film
presents the history of the Berlin Wall through the experiences of
well-known rock musicians and those who lived behind the wall.
Among the rock musicians featured are Robby Krieger (The Doors),
Mark Stein and Vinny Martell (Vanilla Fudge), Rudy Sarzo (Quiet
Riot), David Paich (Toto), Jimmy Haslip (Yellowjackets), and the
group Mother's Finest who played in East Berlin just weeks before
the Wall fell. People who lived behind the Iron Curtain in several
countries describe what their lives were like and how rock music
provided them an important lifeline and inspiration, giving them
hope and exposing the short-comings of the communist system. The
film includes historical footage of the famous speeches at the
Berlin Wall by Presidents Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy, as well
as interviews with former government officials and with European
rocker Leslie Mandoki who recalls being visited by former Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev to discuss the power of music. Based on
the book Seven events that made America, America by Larry
Schweikart. Directed by Marc Leif. Dist.: <a href=

<dt><b>Sympathy for the Devil (aka One Plus One</b> (1968)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Jean-Luc Godard Using both documentary and staged
sequences, this film alternates between an inside look at the
Rolling Stone's recording process and reflections on contemporary
politics and aesthetics. One half of the film focuses on the
recording of the song "Sympathy for the devil" by the Rolling
Stones while the other half of the film presents a series of
sequences dealing with issues like black power, pornography, racism
and Marxism. These sequences provide a chance for Godard to inject
political commentary and musings on the nature of cinema and serve
as counterpoint to the direct presentation of the creative process
seen in the Stones' studio sessions. Special DVD features: One plus
one (director's cut, 97 min.) ; Original theatrical trailer ;
Voices, 1968 documentary about Jean-Luc Godard (43 min.) ; Stills

<dt><b>Heavy Metal in Baghdad; Heavy Metal in Istanbul</b></dt>
<dd>Heavy Metal in Baghdad: A documentary that follows the Iraqi
heavy metal band Acrassicauda (Latin for a deadly black scorpion
native to Iraq) from the fall of Saddam Hussein to their escape
from Iraq. Playing heavy metal in a Muslim country has always been
difficult, but after Saddam's regime was toppled, there was a brief
moment for the band in which real freedom seemed possible. Then
from 2003-2006, Iraq disintegrated around Acrassicauda while they
struggled to stay together and stay alive. Their story echoes the
hopes of an entire generation of young Iraqis. Heavy metal in
Istanbul: This documentary picks up where Heavy Metal In Baghdad
ends, with the Iraqi heavy metal band Acrassicauda reunited in
Istanbul. The band enters a completely new world, facing
international media coverage and taking on United Nations
resettlement processes. With the support of the filmmakers and fans
all over the world, the band faces the future with guarded but
increasing optimism and, as always, unwavering dedication to metal.

their lives. They were not supposed to dance in the former GDR ...
but they did. They met on the streets, trailored their own jogging
suits and painted their shirts with graffiti, imitating the moves
from movies, they trained in front of the mirror and on the
streets. At first isolated by society, breakdance evolved into an
important youth culture symbol in the former East Germany.

rock and roll. We discover the genre's roots in the streetwise
bohemianism of the Velvet Underground, the deliberate ugliness of
Iggy Pop and the campy amateurism of the New York Dolls. We follow
the meteoric rise of "punk" and its fall in England. Shortlived
though the punk movement was, it opened rock up to a new wave of
rock artists. Performers: Malcolm McLaren (Sex Pistols), Velvet

New York, members of Blondie, Talking Heads, Television and the
Ramones tell how they inadvertently created the cynical, urban
sound that became punk rock. In London, punk takes off with the Sex
Pistols, and members of the Wailers and the Clash) recall how
Jamaican reggae crossed international boundaries, deeply
influencing punk and pop rock. <i>The Perfect Beat</i> begins at a
time when megastars like Bruce Springsteen, and Metallica filled
arenas around the world and moves on to chronicle the rise of a new
musical form: rap. From Grandmaster Flash to Run-DMC, from De La
Soul to British innovators New Order to the Beastie Boys, the
program traces the evolution of this new sound in the 80's and
early 90's. Film shows how superstars like Madonna and Prince
folded rap, techno and house, into their music, and how MTV
ultimately embraced it. <b>Video/C 4162</b></dd>

<dt><b>A Riot of My Own.</b> (The Rebels)</dt>
<dd>With the worlds "I am an anarchist" Londoner Johnny Rotten
began a full-blown counterculture of protest and self-expression; a
cry against crushing youth unemployment and a voice for the
disenfranchised. This film examines a new kind of music, a new
social critique and a new form of free speech. Featured are the
bands, the Sex Pistols, The Clash, and the Damned who turned the
rebellious tension of rock and roll back on itself -- and blew it
up. 1998. 47 min. <b>Video/C 7447</b></dd>

<dd>Contents: Garageland -- London's burning -- White riot -- White
man in Hammersmith Palais -- USA -- Safe European home -- Complete
control -- Stay free -- I fought the law -- Rudie can't fail. In
this mixture of concert film and social documentary about the class
system as it exists in the British Commonwealth, the rock group The
Clash performs many of their hit songs while lashing out against
this oppression. The mood is one of disillusion and political
failure in England, as an increasing number of unemployed and
aimless youths see little or no chance of excitement or purpose.
The film features numerous live concert performances of The Clash
as well as offstage and informal performance footage. 1980. 127

<dt><b>Taqwacore: The Birth of Punk Islam</b></dt>
<dd>Taqwacore chronicles the nascent Muslim punk rock movement in
America. It was inspired by the work of Michael Knight, a convert
to Islam who wrote the novel The Taqwacores (a term combining the
Muslim concept of God consciousness with hardcore punk). The film
follows Knight and a variety of young Muslim musicians on tour
through the U.S. before bringing their music to Lahore, breaking
taboos along the way-- from staging a lesbian thrash act at an
Islamic convention to stomping on the American flag, or as Knight
explains, giving the finger to both sides. Taqwacore charts their
attempts to navigate the gap between their cultures and their
countries, their religion and their individuality. Written and
directed by Omar Majeed. 2009. 82 min. <b>DVD X4426</b></dd>

<dt><b>Westway to the World</b></dt>
<dd>The Clash were the band who made Punk real, they were the last
great British rock 'n roll band. Blasting away from the London Punk
scene of the late 1970's, The Clash explored and expanded musical
boundaries like no other act before. In 1981 The Clash played in
front of a screaming full house as their fifth album stood in the
top 5 of American charts. A little over a year later they were no
more. Presented here is the only full, unexpurgated story of the
rock band as told by the members of the band. Special features:
"Clash on Broadway," previously unseen U.S. footage from the band's
personal collection filmed in 1982 when The Clash went to New York;
exclusive unseen interview footage; photo gallery; discography. 107

(1893-1927).</b> Part 1: New York City's turn of the century
musical theater embodied the hope that America offered to millions
of immigrants. The story of legendary producer Florenz Ziegfeld
introduces the era's key figures: songwriter Irving Berlin,
comedienne-singer Fanny Brice and comic Bert Williams -- America's
first "crossover" artists -- and brash song-and-dance man George M.
Cohan, Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II unleased Broadway's
potential with the groundbreaking Show Boat. <b>DVD 3077</b></dd>

2: Prohibition and jazz, along with newly-won freedoms for women,
proved to be fertile ground for musical comedy. Marilyn Miller, the
Marx Brothers, and Al Jolson rocketed to stardom, as songwriter
teams like George and Ira Gershwin, Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle,
and Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart wrote the music that seduced
the nation with New York City's syncopated rhythm. But Broadway's
Jazz Age suffered a one-two punch with the "talking picture" and
the stock market crash. <b>DVD 3077</b></dd>

(1930-1942).</b> Part 3: In the Depression, a musical theater
dichotomy emerged: shows like Cole Porter's Anything goes offered
glamour as an escape, while others -- like Of Thee I sing and The
cradle will rock -- dealt with the era's political concerns.
Rodgers and Hart returned to New York to create new shows, stars
like Ethel Merman and Ethel Waters became top box office draws, and
George Gershwin created his epic folk opera, Porgy and Bess. The
advent of World War II prompted Irving Berlin to write one of his
biggest hits, This is the Army. <b>DVD 3078</b></dd>

what a beautiful mornin' (1943-1960).</b> Part 4: Beginning with
Oklahoma! in 1943, the partnership of Richard Rodgers and Oscar
Hammerstein II set a new standard for storytelling on Broadway.
With On the town, Leonard Bernstein, Betty Comden, Adolph Green,
and Jerome Robbins musicalized wartime New York and Irving Berlin
and Ethel Merman triumphed with Annie get your gun. Shows like Kiss
me, Kate, Guys and dolls, and My fair lady offered sophisticated
literary adaptations, and the Ed Sullivan show brought a television
spot-light to Broadway. With the death of Oscar Hammerstein II in
1960 after the Sound of music, the curtain lowered on a golden age.

the late 50s and early 60s, Broadway continued producing enduring
hits, including the groundbreaking West Side story choreographed by
Jerome Robbins with music by Leonard Bernstein. But in the era of
rock &amp; roll and tumultuous social change, Broadway reinvented
itself and established new traditions. The conceptual theater of
John Kander &amp; Fred Ebb's Cabaret, as directed by Hal Prince,
was followed by the rock musical Hair and the urban angst of
Stephen Sondheim's Company. Bob Fosse showcased sexy cynicism in
Chicago, and Michael Bennett created the blockbuster A chorus line.
With Prince and Sondheim's production of Sweeney Todd, the musical
reached unexpected heights in style and material. <b>DVD

Part 6: As producer David Merrick conquered Broadway with 42nd
Street, and producer Cameron Mackintosh and composer Andrew Lloyd
Webber redefined Broadway, the business of show business took
center-stage. Sondheim's Sunday in the park with George moved from
a workshop Off-Broadway, while Jerry Herman's La cage aux folles
broke new ground in its portrayal of gay romance. Julie Taymor
re-imagined Disney's The lion king, composer Jonathan Larson scored
a bittersweet triumph with Rent, and the old-fashioned musical was
reborn in Mel Brooks' The Producers. The creation of Wicked, the
biggest hit of 2004, highlights the challenges of producing on
Broadway in the 21st century. <b>DVD 3079</b></dd>

minister searches the unfamiliar back alleys and shanty towns of
Johannesburg for his son, Absalom. But Kumalo's unwavering faith is
put to the test when he finds Absalom in jail facing a capital
murder charge. Courage, dignity and sacrifice fall prey to the
whirlwind of racist hypocrisy and hollow justice in Absalom's
trial. Absalom's reunion and reconciliation with this father, his
jailhouse marriage to his pregnant sweetheart, and his heroic
determination to tell the truth set the stage for a tragic climax.

<dd>In a prolific career that spanned seven decades, Richard
Rodgers wrote over 900 songs for more than 70 shows -- a body of
work unmatched by any other theatrial composer in American history.
His celebrated partnerships with lyricists Lorenz Hart and Oscar
Hammerstein II produced some of the most beloved musicals of all
time, but unknown to most, the man behind the music was dark and
solitary -- in complete contrast with the music he created. This
biography of the composer is enriched by interviews with his

technology's ability to make the unaudible audible. The sound
system was designed with the limitation that only sounds that arose
during the performance were to be used -- in other words, the
performers would not make any actions to generate sounds
deliberately, but rather would use technological means to discover
sounds in the air "as through with a net." ... This archival video

<dd>A film by Mira Erdevicki. "Vera Bila does everything in a big
way. Her body is oversized. Her dark hair billows untidily. Her
temperament is fiery. She chain smokes. She belts out songs with
gusto in a hoarse, earthy voice. In fact, this singer from the
Romany tradition is on her way to being a cabaret star in Europe.
Surrounded by the husband she adores, and a loyal entourage of
amateur Gypsy musicians who began as manual laborers, she tours the
capitals of Europe in a caravanthat frequently breaks down. Here is
a portrait of a Gypsy diva who is viewed with indifference and
suspicion in herown country, even as she gains acclaim
elsewhere.The age-old discrimination against Gypsies has shaped
Bila's character. She must constantly battle for acceptance. "Ising
about the troubles I have. I just put everything into my songs.
Sometimes when I sing I cry..." [from <a href=

<dt><b>We Have No War-Songs: Gypsies: the Professional Amateurs of

<dd>Since their appearance in Europe first recorded in the 14th
century, the Gypsies have always struggled for the freedom to live
their own lives in their own way. They have been persecuted,
tortured, expelled and killed, and yet remain unique as the only
nation of people that have never written or sung war songs. Filmed
at the seven day gathering of thousands of Gypsies from all over
the World in Saintes Maires de-la Mer in the South of France, this
film celebrates the unique nature of the Gypsy people and poses
questions of tolerance and individuality in today's increasingly
materialistic and nationalistic world. In English and French with

<dt><b>Whose Song Is This?</b></dt>
<dd>Recounts the filmmaker's search for the true origins of a folk
song claimed by citizens of various Balkan Peninsula countries to
be their own. In her search for the true origins of the melody, the
filmmaker travels to Turkey, Greece, Macedonia, Albania, Bosnia,
Serbia and Bulgaria. The trip is filled with humor, suspense,
tragedy and surprise as each country's citizens passionately claim
the song to be their own and can even furnish elaborate histories
for its orgins. The tune emerges again and again in different
forms: as a love song, a religious hymn, a revolutionary anthem,
and even a military march. The powerful emotions and stubborn
nationalism raised by one song seem at times comical and
othertimes, eerily telling. In a region beseiged by ethnic hatred
and war, what begins as a light-hearted investigation ends as a
sociological and historical exploration of the deep
misunderstandings between the people of the Balkans. Directed by

<dt><b>A Chinese Cracker: The Making of The Peony Pavilion in
Shanghai, New York and Paris.</b></dt>
<dd>Written by 16th-century Chinese playwright Tang Xianzu, The
Peony Pavilion is a 19-hour epic opera in 57 episodes that tells a

their monumental effort of staging the entire production, an event

by the Chinese government and the project's inherent difficulties,

Coverage of rehearsals, set construction, and costume preparation
is combined with interviews with Chen Shi-Zheng and his musical
director Zhou Ming, who place this masterpiece in its historical
and cultural context. Written and directed by Derek Bailey; China
and United States sequences directed by Bill Shebar. c2000. 53 min.

the warden and then wrecking the marriage and career of a police

ring. She abandons the corporal who in a fit of jealous rage stabs

Place/Publisher [Halle/Saale, Germany] : Arthaus Musik, Cast: Franz
Grundheber (Moses), Thomas Moser (Aron), Ildiko Raimondi, Janina
Baechle, Peter Jelosits, Morten Frank Larsen, Georg Tichy, ; Chorus
and Orchestra of the Vienna State Opera ; Slovak Philharmonic
Chorus ; Daniele Gatti, conductor. Perfomed by the Vienna State
Opera in 2006. This work represents Schoenberg's finest attempt at
meshing his philosophical ideas with his artistry. The libretto
reflects his own voice, and his own approach to the original
biblical text. Schoenberg's main point lies in the relationship
between Moses and Aron, and the question of which one of these two
is better suited to leading the Jewish people to their ultimate
goal. Schoenberg is willing to distort the text, and even
fabricate, in order to bring this point across. By showing us the
faults in Aron, Schoenberg highlights the greatness, and the
inhumanity, of Moses. 134 min. <b>DVD 9711</b></dd>

<dt><b>A Chinese Cracker: The Making of The Peony Pavilion in
Shanghai, New York and Paris.</b></dt>
<dd>Written by 16th-century Chinese playwright Tang Xianzu, The
Peony Pavilion is a 19-hour epic opera in 57 episodes that tells a
story of youth and love triumphing over death. This program follows

director Zhou Ming, who place this masterpiece in its historical

<dt><b>The Overture.</b></dt>
<dd>Based on the life of Luang Pradit Pairoh (Sorn Silapabanleng)
the most revered traditional Thai music master who lived during the
reigns of Kings Rama V to VIII. The movie traces the life of Sorn,
who picked up the ra-nad ek (Thai xylophone) mallets as a small
child and played all his life. The backdrop to Sorn's life tale is
the story of Thailand's classical music from its golden age during
the reign of King Rama V to near extinction after the end of the
absolute monarchy when the government banned it as uncivilised in
the 1930s. The film shifts back and forth from the time when Sorn
was a young man, playing in a xylophone duel with the intense Kun
In, to the 1940s, when Thailand was under Japanese occupation and
Sorn's playing would provide some inspiration to the oppressed
citizenry of the time. A film by Itthisoontorn Vichailak. 2004. 104
