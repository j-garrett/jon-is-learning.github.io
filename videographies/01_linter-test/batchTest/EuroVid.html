<dd>This program delves into Kahn's origins and formative years and
the launch of his Archive of the Planet project. Topics include
Kahn's Jewish ancestry and Alsacian upbringing; his early success
in finance; his admiration of Japanese art and customs; the
development of autochrome photography by the Lumi&egrave;re
brothers; Marguerite Mespoulet's colorful documentation of
Ireland's vanishing Celtic traditions; and Kahn's expedition to
Cornwall and London with August Leon. 50 min. <b>DVD X5707</b></dd>

<dd>In 1908, Albert Kahn and his chauffeur embarked on a global
trek to observe and absorb other cultures -- an early "prototype'
of the many photographic missions Kahn would fund over the years.
this program illustrates that formative round-the-world trip as
well as the 1913 journey undertaken by photographer St&eacute;phane
Passet to China, Mongolia and India. Viewers will encounter
startling images of early 20th century Manhattan, San Francisco,
Tokyo and Beijing, as well as views of nascent Rio de Janeiro and
burgeoning Buenos Aires. Scenes from Tsarist Siberia, the Mongolian
steppes, a Varanasi teeming with worshippers, and a
camel-and-elephant caravan on the Khyber Pass reaffirm the
spectacular value of Kahn's grand project. 52 min. <b>DVD

<dd>Poverty, emigration, declining birth rates, and ethnic
divisions weakened many European countries as the 20th century
began. From France to the Balkans, leaders prescribed nationalism
and military buildup as the only solutions. This program studies
the continent's march to war as depicted in the photographic record
commissioned by French banker Albert Kahn. Early color images and
film footage explore a range of themes -- including contrasts
between urbanization and rural life in France, Germany and
Scandinavia, the decline of the Ottoman Empire and its impact in
Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece and Macedonia; and the grittiness of
everyday life in Europe. kahn's pacifism is also a topic. 51 min.

<dd>As World War I engulfed his country, Albert Kahn struck a deal
with the French army: his team of photographers would capture
images and footage that helped the war effort in exchange for
direct access to militarized zones. A century later, this program
presents the results -- revealing the life and environment of the
French soldier as recorded in Kahn's Archive of the Planet. The
visual details of trench warfare and all its misery are combined
with pictures from towns, hospitals , and barracks a few miles from
the front -- evoking the humanity of the ordinary fighting man as
well as the appalling devastation wrought by the era's instruments
of death. 52 min. <b>DVD X5710</b></dd>

<dd>In addition to documenting the Great War, Albert Kahn's team of
photographers recorded the impact of the conflict on French
civilian ife. This program explores both the propaganda value and
the genuine emotional power in images of the war-torn French
populace. French and Belgian refugees, ruined churches, and farms
tended by women and the elderly are a few of the subjects rendered
in exquisite and moving detail. Soissons smolders after a German
retreat; Reims and its shattered cathedral hover on the edge of
total destruction; and the Alsace region, Kahn's birthplace,
regains its French identity. 52 min. <b>DVD X5711</b></dd>

are among the few photographers allowed inside the Hall of Mirrors
for the treaty signing -- an example of Kahn's uncanny talent for
documenting change. This program focuses on Kahn's pictorial record
of the war's aftermath and the challenges of securing a true peace
across Europe. Zeppelin-borne aerial footage conveys the scope of
the destruction, while grave-digging and burial scenes evoke the
staggering number of combatants killed. Other events and subjects
include the influx of foreign workers that filled France's labor
void; the French occupation of the Rhineland; German breadlines and
Paris dance-halls; and war monuments in London and Verdun. 52 min.

<dd>No sooner had Europe declared an end to its Great War than the
seeds of new conflict were sewn -- in the dismemberment of the
Ottoman Empire. With typical global awareness, photography
archivist Albert Khan chose to document the historic changes
occurring in the colonial Middle East. This program traces his
team's expeditions into Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine as
Western powers redrew the map of the region. The French takeover of
Syria, the Balfour Declaration, and Turkey&rsquo;s war with Greece
come to life in Kahn&rsquo;s street-level films and autochromes--
which also serve as reminders that Jerusalem, like many other
Middle East locations, suffered greatly during World War I. 52 min.

<dd>From 1914 through much of the 1920's, Albert Kahn's
photographic team was hard at work in Asia, amassing culturally and
historically vital images. This program recounts journeys through
Indochina and greater Asia in which the Kahn team opened up a world
most Europeans had never dreamed of. Viewers discover Vietnam
through its beggars, Tet celebrants and elegantly dressed Mandarin
administrators; Cambodia, through its dancers and the imposing
Angkor City complex; Japan, through rapidly Westernizing homes,
dress and hairstyles; and India, through pictures of the maharajahs
and other authorities rendered powerless by British rule. 51 min.

<dd>As they built an unsurpassed visual archive of world culture,
Albert Kahn and his photographers turned their attention to widely
divergent locations. This program follows the maritime odyssey of
Lucien Le Saint, circa 1922, as he captured on film the daily lives
of Newfoundland cod fisherman, as well as expeditions into
northwestern Africa. Images from Morocco and Tunisia focus on
occupying French soldiers, the prostitutes they patronized, and
larger changes in those societies, while pictures taken in Dahomey
(now Benin) shed light on the symbiotic relationship between
Catholocism and the Vodun religion. Viewers also learn about the
Colonial Exhibition of 1931, Kahn's financial collapse, and the
fate of his archive after his death in 1940. 51 min. <b>DVD

<dt><b>The Anti-Americans: A Hate/Love Relationship</b></dt>
<dd>Why does Europe hate us? It's a question that comes to mind for
many Americans when they see polls proclaiming that one out of two
Europeans sees America as playing a negative role in the world. A
whimsical, yet serious look at the estrangement between Europeans
and Americans, this documentary travels to Ireland, France, Poland
and Great Britain to examine the thesis that each country responds
to American culture and society in a unique way. Originally
broadcast as a segment of the PBS series America at a Crossroads.

<dt><b>Boomtime, 1948.</b> <i>(People's Century, 1997.)</i></dt>
<dd>After World War II, the USA enjoyed unparalleled prosperity
while Europe and much of the rest of the world suffered from
devastation, lack of food and other necessities, and unemployment.
The American Marshall Plan assisted Europe greatly in its recovery
from the war and helped Europeans learn the 'American way' of doing
things. Europeans began changing their economy by themselves and
became consumers as well as producers. This prosperity lasted until
1973, when the certainty of cheap oil and a world dominated by the
West was over. It was the beginning of the end of the greatest boom
of the century. 56 min. <b>Video/C 6444</b></dd>

Defining "European" is one of the main challenges facing the
European Union Parliament. This program outlines the history of the
governing body and assesses the actions it has taken to shape and
organize the EU. Shedding light on electoral and procedural methods
adopted by the Parliament, the film documents political fanfare and
maneuvering accompanying the eastward expansion of the union with
the entry of Bulgaria and Romania. The program also shows how these
developments influence the path to comprehensive immigration laws
--and how foreign workers, illegal immigrants, and asylum seekers
are affected. Several members of the EU Parliament are interviewed.

Labor Market.</b> With a low birth rate and an aging workforce, the
European Union needs immigrants--but how temporary or permanent
their status should be is a matter of debate. This film examines
existing and proposed guest worker programs, in addition to other
EU measures, designed to address the results of globalization and
shifting demographics. Focusing not only on the EU's tremendous
economic advances but also on regions afflicted by poverty, the
film looks at immigrant education, ambition, and self-employment,
while sifting through issues such as worker job security and the
growth of sex industries. <b>DVD 9164</b></dd>

opportunity for those who smuggle cheap, easily exploited workers
across international borders. But how does the loathsome mechanism
of human trafficking actually occur, and what are EU authorities
doing to fight it? This program investigates by recording the
experiences of human trafficking victims and evaluating the work of
the EU government in the battle against 21st-century slavery.
Corruption, prostitution, victim protection and repatriation, and
the creation of FRONTEX--the agency responsible for European border
patrol--are all highlighted, while members of the European
Parliament and other officials discuss what must be done to improve
anti-smuggling efforts. <b>DVD 9165</b></dd>

program wrestles with questions of identity --racial, cultural, and
sexual--resulting from the startling new diversity of European
society. Depicting daily life in immigrant communities on the
Continent and in Great Britain, the film features observations from
African, Asian, and Middle Eastern transplants. Each offers his or
her personal take on learning a new language, eating unfamiliar
foods, adapting to foreign attitudes toward women and gays, and
other dilemmas. In addition, European MP Wolf Klinz puts forward
his belief that immigrants should be required to learn the language
of their adopted country. <b>DVD 9166</b></dd>

reports on European initiatives intended to improve conditions in
Africa and the Middle East and thus reduce the number of

rights, fair trade, the global war on poverty, the role of the
private sector, and the frustrations of young unemployed
foreigners, the program uses Morocco as a specific case study and
also outlines the significance of the Middle East peace process.

Seventy million soldiers from more than twenty countries marched

The first part of this documentary shows the brickmakers of
Zehdenick, a small town in Brandenburg, and their grim living and
working conditions. Made less than 2 years before the fall of the
Berlin Wall, it was banned by the East German authorities and only

documentary was made in the same town after the wall came down. It
begins with a retrospective to the earlier film, namely the
conversation with the brickmakers which had to be cut from
'Brandenburg Bricks'. The inhabitants feel that their future is
uncertain. The political parties fighting for their attention in
the coming election of March 1990 are utterly incomprehensible to

"Die Republikaner," which represents the neo-fascists new strategy

von Hapsburg was crowned in 1273, the Hapsburg dynasty did not
firmly establish itself until Frederick III passed the crown to his
son, Maximilian I, in 1493. This program traces the roots of the
struggle, showing how the Hapsburg dynasty eventually established
itself, both in Austria and Spain, shaping the course of European

between the Hapsburgs and the Hollenzollerns. Frederick the Great's
rule embodied the Enlightenment as he granted equality to all
citizens and established public education. But Maria Theresa's
claim to the throne was not widely accepted. The ensuing Seven
Years War was a pivotal struggle that firmly established Maria
Theresa on the throne, where she ruled for forty years, followed by
her son, Joseph II. <b>Video/C 5932</b></dd>

inevitable results of this conflict. It shows how demands for
greater freedom, combined with Metternich's resignation, eventually
resulted in greater oppression. In examining the revolution of
1848, the program shows the resulting policy of security over

documentary films and four shorts created by the noted German

peace): This documentary and fiction film was a cooperative writing
effort by five different German writers and/or directors, one of
the most noted being the 1972 Nobel prize winner Heinrich Boll.
Boll was specifically responsible for three fictive episodes at the
end of the film that promote an anti-nuclear, pro-peace message
("Space Talk," "Atom Bunker," and "Kill Your Sister"). Documentary
footage of Chancellors Helmut Kohl and Helmut Schmidt in action,
along with various European and American leaders highlight the
urgent issues of the day. Der Kandidat (The Candidate): This
political documentary puts together clips from newsreels, archives,
and television to review the controversial career of Franz Josef
Strauss who was running for Chancellor of West Germany at the time
this documentary was made. Strauss founded the Christian Socialist
Union and had a long political history as a parliamentarian (1949),
Special Minister (1952), and by 1955 was Minister of Defense. His
career began to unravel when a series of scandals hit the presses
that involved him in kickbacks and abuses of power. Strauss was
forced to resign his post as Defense Minister in the early 1960s.

<dd>When the Berlin Wall fell in November 1989, excitement and joy
were shared by an entire people. In East Germany the transition
into a free market economy, however, proved to be diffuclut. When
jobs suddenly became sparse, women were the ones who were pushed
off the market and of the more than 4 million women who were
employed in East Germany before the wall fell, only 59% are still
employed today. Some now call women the great losers of the East
German revolution. Yet, interviews with these very women show a

<dt><b>Rockin' the Wall</b></dt>
<dd>When the Berlin Wall went up in 1960, it became the worldwide
symbol of communist oppression. While the Wall kept people in, it
could not keep Western influences like rock music out. Through
Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, rock music penetrated the
Iron Curtain with messages of freedom and rebellion. This film
presents the history of the Berlin Wall through the experiences of
well-known rock musicians and those who lived behind the wall.
Among the rock musicians featured are Robby Krieger (The Doors),
Mark Stein and Vinny Martell (Vanilla Fudge), Rudy Sarzo (Quiet
Riot), David Paich (Toto), Jimmy Haslip (Yellowjackets), and the
group Mother's Finest who played in East Berlin just weeks before
the Wall fell. People who lived behind the Iron Curtain in several
countries describe what their lives were like and how rock music
provided them an important lifeline and inspiration, giving them
hope and exposing the short-comings of the communist system. The
film includes historical footage of the famous speeches at the
Berlin Wall by Presidents Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy, as well
as interviews with former government officials and with European
rocker Leslie Mandoki who recalls being visited by former Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev to discuss the power of music. Based on
the book Seven events that made America, America by Larry

<dd>The history of West Berlin from the end of the Second World War
to the days following the building of the Wall on August 13, 1961,
from the perspective of the leaders of the German Democratic
Republic. From a communist perspective the Eastern section of
Berlin was portrayed as a city of peace, while the West was
portrayed as the source of constant disruptions. West Berlin could
only be resisted by forcefully isolating it by the creation of the
wall which would secure the possibility of peace in Europe. First
released as a motion picture in East Germany in 1962. 80 min.

Thus the Party leadership celebrated the achievemnt of the tight

But the further individuals are removed from the processes of
production, the more useless they become from an economic

<dt><b>Acts of Faith: Jewish Civilization in Spain</b></dt>
<dd>Many Latinos in the American Southwest wear amulets and perform
certain practices different from their fellow Latino Catholics--and
are discovering only now, to their amazement, that they are
descended from Jews who chose conversion rather than death at the
time of the great expulsion from Spain in 1492. This film looks at
remnants of what was once the great Jewish civilization in Spain:
the artifacts, which were Christianized or destroyed; and the
people, many of whom continued to practice elements of the religion
and folklore of Judaism and for most of whom the memory of
Jewishness has been extinguished. 1995. 50 min. <b>Video/C

educated men and women take up arms in an ideological bid to
overthrow their democratic governments; and it shows why some fail,
while others are more successful in attaining their goals. It also
shows why highly motivated and intelligent terrorists are so
difficult for police to catch, and underscores the inevitable
temptations for government to bend or break the law in order to
bring the culprits to justice. Looks at terrorist activities in
Italy, Northern Ireland and Spain. c1995. 52 min. <b>Video/C

<dd>This documentary traces the descendants of Spanish Jews who

<dt><b>The Moroccan Labyrinth (Laberinto Marroqui)</b></dt>
<dd>In 1898 Spain focused its colonial aims on northern Morocco,
establishing a Spanish Protectorate in 1912. From 1920 to 1926,
Spanish military attempts to conquer the territory were resisted by
the guerrilla forces of Rif leader Abd el-Krim. The film reveals
how this colonial conflict served as the prologue to the Spanish
Civil War, with losses in the African war undermining the monarchy
and politically emboldening the "African militarists," including
generals such as Francisco Franco, who in 1936 launched a revolt
against the Spanish Republic. Ironically, in order to escape famine
and poverty, thousands of Moroccans enlisted in the Spanish
Falangist movement and found themselves fighting for their former
enemies in Spain against Republican forces. Directed by Julio

1981, Spanish government officials secretly formed the GAL, an
organization whose purpose was to attack ETA using similar methods
of violence and terror. After a pivotal meeting with President
Francois Mitterrand, Spain received the support it needed when
France agreed to assist the GAL in their operations. Concentrating
on the French Basque country --a sanctuary for many of ETA's
members-- GAL actions were directed by Spanish government
officials, deploying hired mercenaries to carry out bombings,
kidnappings and assassinations with the compliance and assistance
of the French police. Through interviews with government officials,
judicial officials and prosecutors, journalists, and the families
of victims - and incorporating rare archival footage --the director
conducts a methodical investigation into the Anti-Terrorist

Beginnings (Pt.1): Introduces the world of the prehistoric Britons,
beginning in Skara Brae, 5,000 years ago, in a world of the
embryonic village. Succeeding generations remained largely
indigenous, trading with but not dominated by the Celts. Conquest
(Pt.2): After the victory of William the Conqueror and the Norman
Conquest, Britain ceased to look north and turned its face south,
becoming part of an Anglo-Norman empire that in time, overshadowed

Dynasty (Pt.3): The great Norman dynasty tears itself apart as
cousins fight over who should be king. Out of their bloody struggle
emerges a new dynasty as well as three of the most famous kings:
Henry II, Richard I and John. At the heart of this medieval history
lies the relationship between church and state, most notably
represented by Thomas Becket and Henry II. Nations (Pt.4): In the
13th century, the people of Britain found their voice: proud and
nationalistic, developed as a response to the subjugation in the
campaigns of Edward I to extend his authority over Wales, Scotland,
and Ireland. Out of this attempted hegemony arose the first written
expression of nationalism. <b>DVD X436; vhs Video/C 8480</b></dd>

out of the Black Death that decimated the British population.
Councilors and courtiers run the kings government and work with a
parliament of members of the rising gentry class. The end of
feudalism and the advent of the printing press lay the groundwork
for the Reformation and later, the Industrial Revolution. Burning
convictions (Pt.6.): Seeking a divorce, Henry VIII breaks away from
the Pope and declares himself the head of the church in England.
This is ultimately the story of three women, Anne Boleyn, Mary I
and Elizabeth who along with Thomases Cranmer and Cromwell, bribed,
tortured and cajoled a nation largely at peace with its Catholic

ascended to the throne in 1625, he brought with him a firm belief
in the divine right of kings putting him at odds with the

<dd>A "documentary" portrait of the capital which can variously be
described as an "essay" or a "journal." Images of London in 1992
are accompanied by an unnamed fictional narrator and Keiller's
imaginary protagonist Robinson. The latter is attempting to
research the city's artistic past and support alternative paths
that the city's history might have taken. The film is made up of
three "expeditions" and other mini-journeys on foot into a London
that few tourists will ever see. The paths taken are inspired by
literary-historical concerns but contemporary political events
intrude. The two reflect on how political decisions might impact
upon the city's future. Written, directed and photographed by

Drawing on case studies, archival footage, and interviews, this
documentary examines controversial changes in immigration policy in
the European Union since the Geneva Refugee Convention of 1951 and
their effects on present-day refugees and asylum-seekers. Five
decades after the Convention, the European immigration system is on
the verge of collapse as a flood of people fleeing persecution and

<dd>Peter Ekwiri, a Ugandan, is only one of many people whose
applications for asylum in the E.U. have been denied. And like many
other blacks from Africa considered "undesirable" by European
governments such as Sweden and Germany, he was forcibly deported,
but not to his home country. This program uses Ekwiri's case as a
springboard to reveal a corrupt system in which E.U. police and
immigration authorities clandestinely pay Ghana to act as a
transfer point, in reality a dumping ground, for black deportees.
And life in Ghana usually means years of imprisonment and an
obscure death. The program also investigates other similar cases
while exploring the statistical implications of European racial
bias against black Africans. <b>DVD 6069</b></dd>

<dd>The Roma have an exotic image: musicians, actors, artists, and
sometimes beggars. Europeans called them 'Gypsies' because they
thought they came from Egypt. But Romani people have lived in
Europe for over a thousand years, and they originally came from
India, not Egypt. Roma communities in Europe have been subjected to
centuries of persecution and racism. They are one of the most
excluded groups in the world. They are denied the chance to work,
proper housing, healthcare and their children refused a decent
education. A new initiative - the Decade of Roma Inclusion - was
launched in 2005 in a concerted attempt to help break the desperate
cycle of poverty in which so many Roma live. Directed by Di Tatham.

<dt><b>We Have No War-Songs: Gypsies: the Professional Amateurs of
Life.</b></dt>
<dd>Since their appearance in Europe first recorded in the 14th
century, the Gypsies have always struggled for the freedom to live
their own lives in their own way. They have been persecuted,
tortured, expelled and killed, and yet remain unique as the only
nation of people that have never written or sung war songs. Filmed
at the seven day gathering of thousands of Gypsies from all over
the World in Saintes Maires de-la Mer in the South of France, this
film celebrates the unique nature of the Gypsy people and poses
questions of tolerance and individuality in today's increasingly
materialistic and nationalistic world. A documentary by Izzy
Abrahami and Erga Netzc. 1995. 53 min. <b>Video/C 6338</b></dd>
