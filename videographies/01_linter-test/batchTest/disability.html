<dt><b>Annie Dearest: The Real Miracle Worker</b></dt>
<dd>Conceived by deaf lesbian performance artist and playwright
Terry Galloway, 'Annie Dearest' is a video parody of The Miracle
Worker. Galloway and her creative team take about 9 minutes to
demolish the myth of the sainted relationship between Helen Keller
and teacher Annie Sullivan; a myth that Galloway feels has inspired
but intimidated generations of deaf and hard of hearing children
who were force-fed The Miracle Worker. This short parody takes a
humorous look at how Keller may have been taught by a not so
patient Sullivan. The 2 minute apologia that follows is a satire of
another sort. Featuring the lip-reading video creator and her
signing stand-in, it offers a critique in the guise of
contriteness-addressing the outrage the video frequently inspires.

his life anything but. Teaming up with veteran documentary maker
and friend Lyell Davies, Rick explores the impact that brain injury
has had on himself and other survivors and reveals helpful

<dd>Muslims, blacks, gays, people with disabilities, and immigrants
of every ethnicity and color: they and many other groups have stood
in the spotlight glare of intolerance, easy targets for every sort
of discrimination and violence. What makes people prone to
irrational hate, and what steps can individuals and society take to
eradicate it? In this program, psychology professors Susan Fiske
and Mahzarin Banaji share their insights and experiences. A pro-gay
Baptist minister who formerly took a biblical stance against
homosexuality and an ex-imperial wizard of the Ku Klux Klan who now
speaks out for tolerance also offer their views. Contents: Defining

<dt><b>The Red Chapel (Det r&oslash;de kapel)</b></dt>
<dd>A one-of-a-kind documentary that reveals the injustices of
North Korea with a hilariously dark wit ... a trio of Danish
comedians, who call themselves "The Red Chapel", pretend to be
regime sympathizers and mount an absurd variety show in Pyongyang.
This stunt is led by the acerbic director Mads Br&uuml;gger, and
assisted by two Danish performers of Korean descent: bulky,
tattooed, guitar-banging hipster Simon Jul, and his spiky-haired
cohort Jacob Nossell, who has cerebral palsy and occasionally uses
a wheelchair. Constantly shadowed by their guide, Mrs. Pak, they
fake allegiance to Kim Jong-il and hope for "One Korea." Only Jacob
is allowed to speak his mind. Suffering from cerebral palsy, his
halting speech is impossible to translate, so he insults his
socialist hosts and receives smiles in return ... an
unconventional, hilarious and damning peek into a totalitarian
nightmare. Directed by Mads Br&uuml;gger. 2009. 88 min. <b>DVD

the childhood and education of Laurent Clerc, a pioneer of deaf
education, is described. When he was twelve, after being deprived
of the opportunity to attend school, he went with his uncle on a
week long journey to the National Institute for Deaf-Mutes in
Paris. It was here that Laurent Clerc spent the next twenty years
and met a young deaf man, Jean Massieu. "I knew that I would learn

examines the life and work of Jean Massieu. Describes Massieu's
frustrated pleas to his father to be allowed to attend school, the
kindness of a stranger that lead to his early education in Bordeau
under the abbe Sicard and several dramatic examples of Massieu's
decades-long friendship with and loyalty to the abbe Sicard. Jean
Massieu was not only a friend and mentor of Laurent Clerc, but he
was also "the first deaf teacher ever and a symbol worldwide of
what a deaf man could achieve through education." c1993. 29 min.

Abbe Roch-Ambroise Sicard, the teacher of Jean Massieu. As the
successor to the Abbe de l'Epee, Sicard, along with Massieu,
presented a petition to the French National Assembly and obtained a
permanent home for the school--Saint-Jacques. Sicard eagerly
continued the tradition of public demonstrations and exhibits
started by the Abbe de l'Epee. In 1815 Sicard undertook a
demonstration tour to London with Massieu, Clerc, and another
students. According to Clerc "thus it was that I first came to meet

of the false education of deaf people. Focus is upon oralism, the
concept that the only proper route for educating deaf students is
oral instruction. A central figure in the oralist controversy is
Jacob Rodrigue Pereire. He claimed to have a secret method for
teaching deaf children to speak. This episode is "a record of the
efforts of hearing people to supplant the language of the deaf with
their language, to replace signs with speech." 33 min. <b>Video/C

Abbe de L'Epee, and the beginning of world wide education for deaf
people. The chance encounter between Abbe de L'Epee and two deaf
sisters launched him on his career with deaf students and inspired
the abbe to begin his school. What is remarkable is that this
occurred in an age when the majority view was that deaf people had
no abstract ideas, no memory and, of course, no language.
"Fortunately, Eppe's independence of spirit kept him from adopting
the prevailing views uncritically." 28 min. <b>Video/C 3133</b></p>

around two men, Jean-Marc Itard and Baron Joseph Marie De Gerando,
who expended great time and energy in futile efforts to transform
deaf students into pseudo-hearing students. There were,
fortunately, outspoken critics of these efforts...men such as
Ferdinand Berthier and Roch-Ambroise Bebian. In the end, both Itard
and De Gerando learned the lessons of their failed experiments. 40

on events that lead to the founding of education for deaf students
in the United States. Thomas Gallaudet, encouraged by Mason
Cogswell to learn the European methods of educating deaf students,
enrolls at Saint-Jacques. It is here that Gallaudet convinces
Laurent Clerc to accompany him to Hartford to assist in founding a
school for the deaf in the United States. "You will be a living

the efforts of Gallaudet and Clerc to establish the American
Asylum, recruit students and seek funding for the school and its
programs. These efforts involved extensive travel and public
lectures not only to solicit funds but also to recruit students so
the school would flourish. Within a dozen years of its founding the
school was receiving students from half the states in the Union.

Sophia Fowler Gallaudet. Alice Cogswell was the deaf daughter of
Mason Cogswell, and the source of the motivation of this pioneer
educator; Julia Brace was the first educated deaf-blind person in
America; Eliza Boardman, a student at the American Asylum, married
Laurent Clerc, in what was the first deaf marriage in America;

to eradicate and eliminate the language and society of the deaf
that had been nurtured at the American Asylum in Hartford. Horace
Mann and Samuel Gridley Howe, self-proclaimed social reformers,
squandered time, effort and money on the surface appearance of oral
language rather than on the true bedrock of intellectual
development. "Powerful hearing people want to replace our language,
to educate us in a foreign tongue, to disperse our gatherings, to
ban our marriages." 18 min. <b>Video/C 3139</b></p>

opposed viewpoints concerning signed and oral languages between
Alexander Graham Bell and Laurent Clerc. Bell was a firm believer
in oralism while Clerc favored a deaf community and sign language.
Clerc believed that the overriding purpose of education was
personal fulfillment, while for Bell it was integration of deaf
persons with the hearing majority. 37 min. <b>Video/C 3140</b></p>

the series is reported from the perspective of Harlan Lane
concerning his views on the current situation for deaf persons. He
believes that the congress held by the Pereire Society in 1880 in
Milan was "the single most critical event which released a tidal
wave or oralism which resulted in the submersion of sign language
and signing communities. He feels the dominance of oralism and the
supression of signing have resulted in the limited educational
achievement of today's deaf men and women, 80% of whom, in America,
are engaged in manual or unskilled labor." 24 min. <b>Video/C

The introductory tape to The Blindness Series, aletheia presents an
indexing of categories investigating different aspects of blindness
as metaphor. <b>Operculum</b>: The artist visits with seven
cosmetic surgeons specializing in blepharoplasty (cosmetic eyelid
creasing surgery) for initial consultation sessions. The doctors
demonstrate different reshaping options and comment upon the
prevalence and success rates for different Asian nationalities.
<b>Kor&eacute;</b>: By focusing on the blindfold, kore explores the
eye as purveyor of desire, sexual fear, and the fantasy of
blindness. <b>Ocularis</b> : eye surrogates: This video highlights
several narratives concerning video surveillance -- not to
reiterate the conventional privacy argument but rather to engage

min.) <b>Ekleipsis</b>: Inspired by a New York Times article about
a group of hysterically blind Cambodian women in Long Beach,
California, known as the largest group of such people in the world.
Hysterical blindness is sight loss brought about by traumatic
stress. The video delves into two histories: the history of
hysteria and the Cambodian civil war, and speaks about the
somatization of pain and loss. <b>Alexia</b>: An experimental video
about word-blindness and metaphor, with accounts of Giambattista
Vico's theory on the origin of language and Ludwig Wittgenstein's
theory on aspect-blindness. Word-blindness is a condition that
usually afflicts people who have suffered a stroke, causing them to
lose the visual recognition of individual letters but perceive the
entire word, or vice versa. <b>Amaurosis</b>: A documentary about
Dat Nguyen, a blind guitarist living in Little Saigon, Orange
County, California. Dat Nguyen was a "triple outcast": blind,
Amerasian, and an impoverished orphan. The tape strives to present
the life of one member from this unique community and promote his
rich contributions. <b>Epilogue</b>: the palpable invisibility of
life: Visualizes the unseen threads between mother and child,
revealing how the ties that bind four generations of women become
manifest when a great-grandmother's imploring words to persevere,
passed from granddaughter to great granddaugheter, compel a woman
to continue her maternal line by ancient means. 2009. 72 min.</dd>

Liedtke, Rowan Thrope, Kareena Oates, Tom Hodgson, Jose Maria
Alves, Robin Dingemans and Eddie Nixon. The work of the dance
troupe DV8 Physical Theatre is about taking risks -- both physical
and aesthetic. It is about personal politics, about breaking down
barriers between dance and theatre and, above all, about
communicating ideas and feelings clearly and unpretentiously. The
company tells stories through extended naturalistic movement in a
radical yet accessible way, rejecting the traditional conventions
of ballet and modern dance. The Cost of Living highlights the
troupe in a story about two dancers, Eddie, a tough confrontational
guy and David, a legless dancer who is determined not to let his
disability or society's prejudices get him down. 2004. 35 min.

<dt><b>Shameless: The Art of Disability</b></dt>
<dd>What does it mean to be disabled and how does it shape an
artist's work? This documentary explores what is known as the
disability art movement, following five artists--including a
painter, a writer, an actor, a theater director, and a filmmaker,
all of whom happen to have physical disabilities--through their
creative work. Intense group discussions of artistic and personal
goals are also recorded. Dispelling the myth of tragic disability,
the film depicts its subjects as, first and foremost, creative
people. The result is a profound look at, and celebration of, the
act of making art--viewed through the lens of disability and the
rejection of its stereotypes. Dist.: <a href=
