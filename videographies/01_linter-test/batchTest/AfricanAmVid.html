"10" height="10"> <b>The Downward Spiral.</b> Episode one opens in
the 1620s with the introduction of 11 men of African descent and
mixed ethnicity into slavery in New Amsterdam. Working side by side
with white indentured servants, these men labored to lay the
foundations of the Dutch colony that would later become New York.
There were no laws defining the limitations imposed on slaves at
this point in time. Enslaved people, such as Anthony d'Angola,
Emmanuel Driggus, and Frances Driggus could bring suits to court,
earn wages, and marry. But in the span of a hundred years,
everything changed. By the early 18th century, the trade of African
slaves in America was expanding to accommodate an agricultural
economy growing in the hands of ambitious planters. After the
violent Stono Rebellion many colonies adopted strict "black codes"
transforming the social system into one of legal racial oppression.
<b>DVD 3918</b></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10"> <b>Liberty in the Air.</b> Episode 2. From the
1740s to the 1830s, the institution of slavery continued to support
economic development. As the slave population reproduced, American
planters became less dependent on the African slave trade. Ensuing
generations of slaves developed a unique culture that blended
elements of African and American life. Episode two follows the
paths of several African Americans, including Thomas Jefferson's
slave Jupiter, Colonel Tye, Elizabeth Freeman, David Walker, and
Mariah Stewart, as they respond to the increasingly restrictive
system of slavery. At the core of this episode is the Revolutionary
War, an event which reveals the contradictions of a nation seeking
independence while simultaneously denying freedom to its black
citizens. <b>DVD 3919</b></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10"> <b>Seeds of Destruction.</b> One by one the
Northern states, led by Vermont in 1777, adopted laws to abolish
and phase out slavery. Simultaneously, slavery in the Southern
United States entered the period of its greatest expansion. Episode
three, which starts at the beginning of the 1800s, examines
slavery's increasing divisiveness in America as the nation develops
westward and cotton replaces tobacco as the country's most valuable
crop. The episode weaves national events through the personal
histories of three African American slaves -- Harriet Jacobs,
Solomon Northup and Louis Hughes -- who not only managed to escape
bondage, but also exposed the horrific realities of the slave
experience in autobiographical narratives. These and other stories
of physical, psychological, and sexual exploitation fed the fires
of a reinvigorated abolitionist movement. With a diverse membership
comprised of men and women, blacks and whites, and led by figures
including Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, and Amy Post,
abolitionist sentiment gathered strength in the North, contributing
to the widening fissure and imminent break-up of the nation. <b>DVD

"10" height="10"> <b>The Challenge of Freedom.</b> Looks at Civil
War and Reconstruction through the experiences of South Carolina
slave Robert Smalls. It chronicles Smalls' daring escape to
freedom, his military service, and his tenure as a congressman
after the war. As the events of Smalls' life unfold, the
complexities of this period in American history are revealed. The
episode shows the transformation of the war from a struggle for
union to a battle over slavery. It examines the black contribution
to the war effort and traces the gains and losses of newly freed
African Americans during Reconstruction. The 13th amendment
abolished slavery in 1865, the 14th and 15th amendments guaranteed
black civil rights, and the Freedmen's Bureau offered aid to former
slaves throughout the 1870s. Yet simultaneously, the formation of
militant groups, such as the Ku Klux Klan threatened the future of
racial equality and segregation laws began to appear across the
country. Slavery's eradication had not brought an end to black
oppression. <b>DVD 3921</b></dd>
<dt><b>A Son of Africa.</b></dt>
<dd>A docudrama based on the book, The Interesting Narrative of the
Life of Oloudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vaasa the African, which was
the first influential slave autobiography. When it was published in
1789, it fueled a growing anti-slavery movement in the U.S. and
England. This production employs dramatic reconstruction, archival
material and interviews with scholars. Equiano's narrative begins
in the West African village where he was kidnapped into slavery in
1756. He was shipped to a Virginia plantation and then later sold
again to a British naval officer. Here he learned to read and
write, became a skilled trader, eventually bought his freedom and
married into English society where he became a leading
abolitionist. 1996. 28 min. <b>DVD 3053; also VHS Video/C 4464</b>

<dt><b>Unchained Memories: Readings From the Slave
Narratives</b></dt>
<dd>When the Civil War ended in 1865, more than 4 million slaves
were set free. By the late 1930's, 100,000 former slaves were still
alive. In the midst of the Great Depression, journalists and
writers traveled the country to record the memories of the last
generation of African-Americans born into bondage. Over 2,000
interviews were transcribed as spoken, in the vernacular of the
time, to form a unique historical record. Presented here are
dramatic readings from these narratives, bringing to life the pride

<dt><b>Up From Slavery</b></dt>
<dd>A seven part series documenting the history of slavery in
America from colonial times to after the Civil War. America was
founded upon the idea that all men are created equal and endowed by
their creator with the inalienable rights of life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness. The nation would pay a bloody cost for
denying that right to more than twelve percent of its population.
But when slavery was first brought to America's shores, this war,
and even the nation it tore apart, was centuries in the future.
With incredibly detailed historical reenactments, expert commentary
and the stories of slavery told through first-hand accounts, this
is an epic struggle 400 years in the making. Contents: Pt. 1 1619

<dt><b>The "New Negro" Arts Movement</b> (Art: Transatlantic
Modernism)</dt>
<dd>Between WWI and WWII nearly 2 million blacks migrated to Harlem
making it an exciting and culturally rich neighborhood. Although
there was still much bigotry directed towards blacks it was the
first time that America saw the potential for major art to come out
of a great black community. Here Professor Corn shows numerous
examples of African-Americans being "in vogue" in the 20's -- one
example is famed dancer Josephine Baker, whose high moment of fame
in Paris -- "Revue Negre" made her a symbol of the "new woman."

<dd>Before and during the Second World War Jewish scholars who
escaped Nazi Germany and immigrated to the U.S. faced anti-Semitism
at major universities and a public distrust of foreigners, so a
significant number secured teaching positions at historically Black
colleges in the South. In many cases they formed lasting
relationships with their students and had an important impact on
the communities in which they lived. This is a story of two
cultures, each sharing a burden of oppression, brought together by

<dd>Documentary film, using a combination of interviews with
participants, still photographs, and testimony from the trial,
about the Port Chicago mutiny. The mutiny trial followed the worst
home-front disaster of WWII, the deaths of 320 men in a munitions
explosion at Port Chicago. The seamen loading the munitions were
black and the officers in charge were white. Afterwards, the seamen
who had not been working at the time of the explosion refused to
return to loading munitions under the same conditions. Fifty were
charged, not with disobeying an order, but with mutiny, a crime
punishable by death. Narrator: Danny Glover. Interviews: Joseph
Small (found guilty of mutiny), Robert Routh (injured in initial
explosion), Percy Robinson (returned to work), Gerald Veltmann
(defense attorney). Based on the book by Robert L. Allen, "Port
