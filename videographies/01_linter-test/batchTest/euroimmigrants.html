<dt><b>Salut cousin!</b> (France | Algeria | Belgium | Luxembourg,
2000)</dt>
<dd>Director, Merzak Allouache. Cast: Gad Elmaleh, Mess Hattou,
Magaly Berdy, Ann-Gisel Glass. Alilo arrives in Paris, met by his
hip cousin Mok. Alilo is to pick up a suitcase of dresses to
smuggle back to Algiers for resale. He's lost the dressmaker's
address and his boss is gone for five days, so he stays in the
Moskova neighborhood of the 18th arrondissement with Mok. Mok makes
rap music of Jean de La Fontaine's fables, invents fabrications of
his own, is in debt to his bookie, and in love with a punk rocker.
Alilo's old-country sweetness, in contrast with Mok's big-city
neuroses, gets the attention of Fatoumata, a lovely African
neighbor. Once Alilo gets the dresses, he must return to Algiers,
but it seems he's only started to live: is there any way he can
stay? 98 min. <b>DVD X4758; vhs 999:3096</b></dd>

that has become more and more difficult to cope with as the years
go by. He is a divorced father who forces himself to stay close to

off and that financial difficulties make even more intense. He is
going through a delicate period in his life and, recently,
everything seems to make him feel useless: a failure. He wants to
escape from it all and set up his own restaurant. However, it
appears to be an unreachable dream given his meager, irregular
salary that is not anywhere near enough to supply what he needs to
realize his ambition. But he can still dream and talk about it with
his family in particular. A family that gradually gives its support
to this project, which comes to symbolize the means to a better
life. Thanks to its ingeniousness and hard work, this dream soon
becomes a reality...or almost." [IMDB] 180 min. <b>DVD

gypsies, dancing and playing music. After an opening dance, a
quartet of beer-drinkers gargles the Volga Boatman song, then
another group hauling on a rope sings it (we finally see that the
other end of the rope is anchored by a very small dog). A
trench-coated bomber sneaks into the palace, where we see
Rice-Puddin', the mad monk, cheating at a jigsaw puzzle. He spies
the activity in the gypsy camp and orders a henchman to fetch the
gypsy girl. The villagers revolt as a result, sending The Mad Monk
scrambling on his horse; they stuff a bomb into his pants just as
he turns his horse into a helicopter, and it explodes." [<a href=
