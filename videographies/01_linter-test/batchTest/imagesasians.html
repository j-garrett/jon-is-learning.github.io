<dt><b>Bad Day at Black Rock</b> (1954)</dt>
<dd>Directed by John Sturges. Cast: Spencer Tracy, Robert Ryan,
Anne Francis, Dean Jagger, Walter Brennan, John Ericson, Ernest
Borgnine, Lee Marvin, Russell Collins, Walter Sande. "Bad Day at
Black Rock is both a tightly-written, suspenseful, dramatic action
film (with film noirish qualities) and a western. On the surface,
this American film classic is concerned with the themes of
individual integrity, group conformity and complacency, and civic
responsibility. It can also be seen as a powerful, allegorical
indictment of the Hollywood blacklist, created during the climate
of suspicion and fear of the 1950s McCarthy era. The message of
director John Sturges' taut and influential film can be interpreted
with different levels of meaning, but predominantly as the tense
portrayal of a one-armed stranger who intrusively has arrived in a
half-forgotten desert town filled with ruffians. Over a twenty-four
hour period, he finds himself unwelcome and facing several ominous
characters, animosity, collective guilt, hypocrisy, and bigotry.
The film builds suspense by withholding information about the
visitor's mysterious mission, and by creating a who-dun-it mystery
regarding the hostile town's secret. Eventually, he learns the
town's dark secret, and fulfills the promise he made to present a
posthumous Congressional Medal of Honor for heroism to the farming
father of a Japanese wartime buddy who had saved his life in World
War II on the battlefields of Italy." [<a href=

<dt><b>Bonanza</b></dt>
<dd>1960's television western program. Cast: Dan Blocker, Michael
Landon, Lorne Greene, Pernell Roberts. For MRC holdings, <a href=

videography</a>
<p>A regular character of the series is the cook Hop Sing, played
by veteran actor Victor Sen Yung. "Hop Sing was the Cartwright
family's cook on the US television series Bonanza which ran on the
NBC network from 1959-73. Victor Sen Yung played the Chinese
immigrant. Although the character may have promoted some
Chinese-American stereotypes, such as his being a servant (an
economic niche also shared by African Americans in the American
South), he is not commonly cited as an offensive use of Asian
characters. The Chinese were historically marginalized in the labor
market of the American west into niches where they would not
compete with Caucasians. Marlo Thomas was also cast as a Chinese in
one episode, and other prominent Chinese Americans would also be
cast on Bonanza. During the western's fourteen year run, just two
episodes centred around the character. The first dealt with Hop
Sing saving Little Joe from a false murder charge via the ancient
science of fingerprinting or (as Hop Sing referenced) "chops". The
second episode, written by Michael Landon, dealt with Caucasian
biases against Asians in the 1880s, when Hop Sing fell in love with
a white woman." [<a href=

Sessue Hayakawa. "Richard Hardy, a hardworking stockbroker, labors
overtime to keep up with the ruinous bills incurred by his
beautiful but irresponsible wife Edith, a venal, spoiled socialite
who is impervious to his pleas for fiscal restraint. Acting on what
she believes to be an insider information, she impulsively
embezzles $10,000 from the Red Cross charity she chairs for a stock
tip. When she finds the money has been lost, she desperately turns
to a Japanese ivory trader with whom she has been thoughtlessly
flirting and persuades him to replace the money in exchange for an
assignation. When her husband's long-awaited business deal finally
materializes, she desperately tries to withdraw from their
agreement by replacing the money. Angered and disappointed with her
resistance to his advances, he uses a branding device to mark her
shoulder as his property. Feeling violated, Edith shoots him in the
shoulder and leaves. In order to protect his wife's reputation,
Richard confesses to the crime and faces trial for attempted

<dt><b>Charlotte Sometimes</b> (2002)</dt>
<dd>Director, Eric Byler. Cast: Jacqueline Kim, Michael Idemoto,
Eugenia Yuan, Matt Westmore, Shizuko Hoshi, Kimberly-Rose Wolter.
Shot on video in and around Los Angeles's bohemian Silver Lake
district, Eric Byler's "Charlotte Sometimes" is a small, subtle
character study about a young Asian-American, Michael (Michael
Idemoto), who by day repairs cars and by night manages a small
apartment building that belongs to his aunt. Michael, a young
mechanic, is forced to choose between a daring tryst with an
alluring stranger (Jacqueline Kim) and the habitual comfort of his
bittersweet obsession, his beautiful young roommate. "Like almost
every domestic drama with an Asian connection, ''Charlotte
Sometimes'' has been compared to the work of Yasujiro Ozu, the
Japanese master of emotional understatement. But ''Charlotte
Sometimes'' seems closer in spirit to the work of the French
filmmaker Eric Rohmer, sharing his fascination with courtship
rituals among the young and the paradoxes of desire." [Kehr, Dave.

<dt><b>Go For Broke!</b> (1951)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Robert Pirosh. Cast: Van Johnson, Gianna Maria
Canale, Warner Anderson, Lane Nakano, Henry Nakamura, George Miki,
Henry Oyasato. "Go for broke" was the combat slogan of one of World
War II's most unusual fighting teams. The 442nd Regiment, comprised
of Nisei--loyal Americans of Japanese ancestry--exhibits heroism
far beyond the call of duty, overcoming the Nazis as well as the
extreme prejudice of the white Americans who cannot accept "Japs"
on their side. In this historically based drama a bigoted
lieutenant rides the Nisei hard in basic training, creating
enormous hostility-- but also resulting in a highly-disciplined
fighting force that proves to be a major factor in the liberation
of Italy and France. <b>DVD 2879; vhs 999:1150</b></dd>

<dt><b>Hollywood Party</b>(1937)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Roy Rowland. A short music and comedy review. "The
film's main drawback, however, is the premise--a group of white
actors dressing up and acting like "Chinamen" (comedian Charley
Chase is particularly embarrassing doing an awful Fu Manchu/Charlie
Chan impersonation), including everyone from the band to the
waiters. Leon Errol does his patented drunk routine but it doesn't
seem to really have anything to do with the movie--it just involves
him and a waiter for a minute or two and then they're gone--and a
quartet of black singers does a clever "hum" of "Chinatown My
Chinatown". Even for the "unenlightened" 1930s, this short really
pours on the stereotypes about Asians, especially Chinese."

<dd>Director, J. Walter Rubens. Cast: Anna May Wong, Elizabeth
Allan, Edmund Gwenn, John Loder, Ralph Richardson. "In her final
British star vehicle, Anna May Wong plays a Chinese princess who
follows her new husband Gerrit, a young Englishman from a wealthy
shipping family, back to 19th century Bristol. The husband's
conservative family is scandalized by the arrival of his bride,
whose sensational clothing and make-up stands in stark contrast to
the restrained Victorian setting. They refuse to accept the
stranger, preferring that Gerrit rekindle his courtship of Nettie,
a local girl. Cultural differences come between the young couple
when the husband rejects his wife's religious faith and confesses
his love for Nettie. This film is notable for its frank depiction
and implicit critique of the fetishizing of Asian women." [from

<dt><b>Picadilly</b> (1929)</dt>
<dd>Direced by E.A. Dupont. Cast: Anna Mae Wong, Jameson Thomas,
Gilda Gray, Charles Laughton, Cyril Ritchard, Hannah Jones. "Just
before making his talkie directorial debut with Atlantic, director
E.A. DuPont dashed off the silent "backstage" drama Piccadilly. By
the time the film was released in 1929, talking pictures had taken
a firm hold of the British film industry, obliging DuPont to
reshoot much of the picture with dialogue. American screen
favorites Anna May Wong and Gilda Gray (the girl who popularized
the "shimmy dance") head the cast, the former as Shosho, a
dishwasher in the London nightclub where the latter, cast as dancer
Mabel Greenfield, performs nightly. Jealous of Mabel's dancing
partner Victor Smiles (Cyril Ritchard), club owner Wilmot (Jameson
Thomas) fires Victor, whereupon business drops off dramatically. In
desperation, Wilmot takes Shosho out of the kitchen and puts her on
stage, where she scores a big success. Feeling threatened by
Shosho, Mabel heads to her rival's apartment with blood in her eye.
A shot rings out, Shosho falls dead, and Mabel is accused of
murder. But during the trial, it turns out that Shosho was done in
by her Chinese sweetheart Jim (Kim Ho Chang). In his first feature
film appearance, Charles Laughton performs an outrageous bit as a
rowdy night club patron; also seen in a minuscule role is young Ray
Milland. The talkie version of Piccadilly wasn't released in the
U.S. until 1932." (Hal Erickson, <a href=

<dt><b>The Tong Man</b> (1919)</dt>

<p>"Seeking creative control over his films, Japanese American
actor Sessue Hayakawa established Haworth Pictures in 1918. (See
also The Dragon Painter, December 4.) The first year out, he
produced and starred in The Tong Man, a somewhat incendiary
melodrama set in San Francisco's Chinatown. The story concerns a
Tong hatchetman who refuses to murder his sweetheart's father. All
manner of criminal activity-murder, extortion, drug dealing,
kidnapping-transpires in this action-packed version of Romeo and
Juliet whose delicate heroine is played by Helen Jerome Eddy, an
obviously Anglo actress. The Tong Man's mismanagement of cultural
imagery is ironically undercut by the subtle but daring possibility
that a non-white leading man could win the love of a Caucasian
actress. Nevertheless, the questionable depiction of Chinese
culture caused an uproar in the community; an injunction against
the film's exhibition was sought by San Francisco's Six Companies,
and denied." [<a href=

<dt><b>Hollywood Chinese: the Chinese in American Feature
Films</b></dt>
<dd>Documents the representation and involvement of the Chinese in
American cinema from the silent era to the 21st century. While
celebrating their contributions to American filmmaking a haunting
and telling undercurrent of racism and stereotypes weaves its way
in, suggestive of the difficulties that Chinese men and women found
working in Hollywood -- particularly in the early years. As a
historical footnote, Dong also makes film history by rediscovering
and editing in footage from what is alleged to be the first
Asian-American film ever made: the 1916 "The Curse of Quon Gwon,"
directed by Marion Wong.
