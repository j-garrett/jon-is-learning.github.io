<dt><b>The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the
World</b></dt>

<dt><b>Black Gold</b></dt>
<dd>After oil, coffee is the most actively traded commodity in the
world with $80 billion in retail sales. But for every $3 cup of
coffee, a coffee farmer receives only 3 cents. Most of the money
goes to the middlemen, especially the four giant conglomerates
which control the coffee market. Tracing the path of the coffee
consumed each day to the farmers who produce the beans, Black Gold
asks us to 'wake up and smell the coffee', to face the unjust
conditions under which our favorite drink is produced and to decide
what we can do about it. In particular, It follows Tadesse Meskela
as he tries to get a living wage for the 70,000 Ethiopian coffee
farmers he represents. Filmed, directed, and produced by Marc
Francis &amp; Nick Francis. 2006. 78 min. <b>DVD 6628</b>

time, all around the world people are resisting those policies,
demanding a re-regulation of trade and finance - and, far from the
old institutions of power, they're starting to forge a very
different future. Communities are coming together to re-build more

<dt><b>Elite Globalization vs People's Globalization</b></dt>
<dd>Kevin Danaher speaks of two types of globalization. Elite
globalization features money values, violence, and the "God is on
our side" mentality. It is driven by big corporations seeking to
maximize their profits at the expense of human needs. People's
globalization is a grassroots movement espousing life values,

people who are working to improve lives by creating opportunities
for education for children who are often left to fend for
themselves. Among them are Sompop Jantraka, who has started a
school for young Thai girls with the goal of saving them from
entering into prostitution, and Dina Abdel Wahab who has started
schools in Egypt for the nation's often-neglected children with
disabilities. In Calcutta, Inderjit Khurana has set out to bring
education to children who beg in the train stations -- setting up a
school right on the railway platforms.</dd>

"10" height="10"> <b>The Food Machine.</b> Discusses the farm
crisis in the United States in which small farms are being bought
by large corporations. This pattern has been transplanted to
underdeveloped countries, such as the Sudan resulting in increased
food costs and a destabilizing of the rural population. <b>DVD X993

<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10"> <b>The Avoidable Famine.</b> Examines the impact
of changes in traditional farming methods on the economy of Sudan.
When the Sudan was a colony of Great Britain, the best farm land
was used to grow cotton but a drop in cotton prices in the 1970's
dictated a return to traditional food crops, which made the Sudan
self-sufficient in food. Then the International Monetary Fund
insisted that the nation return to growing cotton as a condition
for making loans to the Sudan. Cotton prices remained low and the
nation was forced to import grain from the U.S.--thus pushing the
Sudan deeper into debt while the people starved. <b>DVD X994

rapid industrial expansion in Brazil and the need for land reform.
Brazil's "economic miracle" of the 1970's was supposed to "trickle
down" to the poorest segments of the population but only the top
10% of the population benefitted from the economic policy, while
the gap between rich and poor grew. The resulting huge debt has
caused an even greater emphasis on the export of food, causing
shortages and higher prices in Brazil. <b>DVD X995 [preservation

international trade of agricultural products effects underdeveloped
nations. The U.S., as the world's dominant producer of
cerealgrains, is an important player in the global trade of food.
Grain exports are seen in the U.S. as a good way of eliminating
agricultural surpluses but food aid can prevent poor nations from
becoming self-sufficient because the government of those nations
has no incentive to develop policies to increase food production.

every person can afford basic nutrition and government developed
programs assure high standards of health, education and birth
control. Bangladesh, however, is heavily dependent on foreign aid,
most of which is used to support the urban middle class while the

<dd>A documentary made in response to the corporate media's
portrayal of anarchists since the anti-corporate globalization

capitalism: the exploitation in moments of crisis of vulnerable

jolted by catastrophic events such as war or natural disasters,
they are often subjected to totally unregulated 'free market'
remedies that benefit corporations at public expense. This film
traces the doctrine's beginnings in the radical theories of Milton
Friedman and it's subsequent implementation in the past 40 years in
countries as disparate as Augusto Pinochet's Chile, Boris Yeltsin's
Russia, Margaret Thatcher's Great Britain, and most recently
through the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. Directed by Mat

<dt><b>The Yes Men</b></dt>
<dd>A comedic documentary which follows The Yes Men, a small group
of prankster activists, as they gain world-wide notoriety for
impersonating the World Trade Organization on television and at
business conferences around the world. The film begins when two
members of The Yes Men, Andy and Mike, set up a website that mimics
the World Trade Organization's --and it's mistaken for the real
thing. They play along with the ruse and soon find themselves
invited to important functions as WTO representatives. Delighted to
represent the organization they politically oppose, Andy and Mike
don thrift-store suits and set out to shock unwitting audiences
with darkly comic satire that highlights the worst aspects of
global free trade. Directed by Chris Smith, Dan Ollman, Sarah
Price. 2003. 82 min. <b>DVD X19</b></dd>
<dt><b>The Yes Men Fix the World</b></dt>
<dd>"The film consists of a several pranks on major corporations
and governmental agencies that are performed by Andy Bichlbaum and
Mike Bonanno (in real life Jacques Servin &amp; Igor Vamos) who
fancy themselves serious anti-globalization activists. The two pose
as executives from Exxon, Dow Chemical, Halliburton and the H.U.D.
They give faux corporate interviews pretending to be DOW executives
in which they supposedly announce setting up a $12 billion fund for
the victims of the 1984 Bhopal disaster that killed 1,773 people.
The BBC fell for this prank and aired the faux interview. This
caused DOW's stock plummet. Our mindless heroes celebrate their
power, but fail to realize that most of DOW's stock is held by
pension funds; in other words, regular working class retirees. The
dynamic duo conveniently found a few such victims who claimed to
enjoy the hoax and its impact on DOW's stock. " [<a href=

point where disparities are so wide that we finally find the
political will to take action? Conversely, will the disparities
themselves grow so wide as to discourage action, by fostering
resignation among the losers and indifference among the winners?

educators, librarians, homeschoolers and parents who are taking the
lead in introducing the Internet to students. As an example of
"real time" instruction it follows the Polar Bridge Expedition of
1988 in which students daily tracked the experiences and successes

only through learning the changing habits of people that Web
development can be traced. As more people join cyberspace
communities, the more important it will be to know what type of

<p>"Banned in the UK. The film McDonald's does not want you to see!
McDonald's spends $1.8 billion a year on advertising. At the same

attempt at censorship turned into a public relations disaster.
McLibel is the dramatic and inspiring story of how two ordinary but

corporations. It is also a highly informative examination of the
global food business, addressing issues such as the manipulation of
children through glossy advertising, the promotion of an unhealthy
diet, the exploitation of workers, the environmental damage caused
by agribusiness, and the cruelty inflicted on animals in the

<dt><b>The Real Dirt on Farmer John</b></dt>
<dd>The Peterson family farm is located in Caledonia, 75 miles
outside Chicago. Like many farms, it thrived for decades and
expanded in the 1960s to survive. As John Peterson approached his
college years, his father unexpectedly died, leaving him in charge.
Thus, John became a farmer, albeit a strange farmer, with one foot
in the counterculture and the other in rich organic soil. The film
explores the Rockwellian experience of growing up on a Midwestern
farm, the calamitous failure of family farms in the age of
corporate farming, and the rise of organic gardening and Community
Supported Agriculture. Special features: "Bitter Harvest"

<dt><b>Marketing the Message</b></dt>
<dd>Husband and wife filmmakers Joe and Kate Bly take a road trip
from Washington D.C. to Orlando, Florida, surveying ways in which
Christian evangelism is stepping up its campaign [to convert
non-believers] and rebrand itself to fit within mainstream pop
culture. Along the way they find a Christian skateboarding tour,
hip accessories for teens, a preaching wrestler, NASCAR fans
distributing racing Bibles and the Holy Land Experience -- a Bible
themed amusement park -- pushing the envelope of faith-based
entertainment. The debate is joined by commercial marketers,
pastors and plain folks. 2006. 26 min. DVD 8761</dd>
<dt><b>Maxed Out: Nothing is Priceless</b></dt>
<dd>Takes a journey deep inside the American style of debt, where
things seem fine as long as the minimum monthly payment arrives on
time. Posits that most people are getting in trouble because the
banks and credit card companies are setting their customers up to
fail. Why? The more credit they give us, the more credit we need.
When we inevitably fall behind, they can charge the huge late fees
and the over-limit fees and the stratospheric interest rates that
drive their profits. Shocking and incisive, the film paints a
picture of a national nighmare, which is all too real for most.

<dd>The average American family today carries 10 credit cards.
Credit card debt and personal bankruptcies are now at an all time
high. With no legal limit on the amount of interest or fees that

last year alone. Frontline and the New York times join forces to

pervasive, so lucrative, and so powerful. Originally broadcast as a

<dt><b>Shop 'til You Drop: The Crisis of Consumerism</b></dt>
<dd>Are we too materialistic? Are we willfully trashing the planet
in our pursuit of things? And what's the source of all this
frenetic consumer energy and desire anyway? This fast-paced tour of
the ecological and psychological terrain of American consumer

depletion -- the slow, steady erosion of both natural resources and
basic human values. In the end, Shop 'Til You Drop helps us make

of consumerism and our never-ending pursuit of happiness. Directed

<dd>In September 2008 the American economy was on the verge of

high-profile interviews with key players Ken Lewis (Bank of

<dd>Meet Michael Ruppert, a different kind of American. A former
Los Angeles police officer turned independent reporter, he
predicted the current financial crisis in his self-published
newsletter, From the Wilderness, at a time when most Wall Street
and Washington analysts were still in denial. He is now warning of
a new meltdown, one rooted in oil, economics and covert U.S.
policies leading towards unprecedented global disaster. Is he a
prophet who can clearly see America's terrifying future or a
conspiracy theorist fueled by fear and paranoia? And if Ruppert is
right, can this slide into catastrophe be stopped? Based on a book

<dt><b>Blood and Oil</b></dt>

concerns about oil have been at the core of American foreign policy
for more than 60 years -- rendering our contemporary energy and
military policies virtually indistinguishable. Based on the book
Blood and oil by Michael T. Klare. Directed by Jeremy Earp. c2008.

<dt><b>A Crude Awakening: The Oil Crash</b></dt>
<dd>A documentary film that debunks the conventional wisdom that
oil production will continue to climb, and instead stares bleakly
at a planet facing economic meltdown and conflict over its most
valuable resource. "Our civilization's addiction to oil puts it on
a collision course with disaster .. the film visits with the
world's top experts and comes to a startling but logical
conclusion--our industrial society, built of cheap and readily
available oil, must be competely re-imagined and overhauled. The
world's oil supplies are peaking and the crisis of global shortage
looms, we are running out of oil and we don't have a plan."
Contents: Precious and non-renewable -- We use it for everything!
-- From boom to bust -- A magnet for war -- The numbers don't add
up -- Peaking out -- An insatiable demand -- The end of the
American Dream -- Technology to the rescue? -- Life after the peak.

<dt><b>A Crude Impact</b></dt>
<dd>As the worldwide dependence on oil continues to grow, what does
it mean for our world? Journeying from the West African Delta to
the Amazon rainforest, from Washington to Shanghai, from early man
to the unknown future, Crude Impact unravels the complex
entanglement of a fierce devotion to oil with the fate of
indigenous cultures, human rights, our global economy and the
planet itself. Fueled by discovery, outrage, humor and ultimately

<dd>Explores the inextricable economic and environmental
connections between farmers in Latin America, coffee drinkers in
the U.S., and the fate of migratory songbirds throughout the
Americas. Part 1 of the film examines the background and global
intricacy of the "coffee crisis," an ongoing situation that has
been described as a "humanitarian catastrophe." To illustrate, we
meet coffee growers in the rainforest of southern Costa Rica, whose
lives vividly exemplify the unjust effects of global market
mechanisms that keep coffee growers' prices down even as the retail
prices for coffee increase in the U.S. Part two examines a variety
of simple but effective solutions to the coffee crisis and explains
the rationale behind and the importance of fair trade coffee.

<dt><b>May Justice Be Done</b></dt>
<dd>By any standard Argentina was a very rich country until the
1970s, with competitive industries, modern agriculture, and a
prosperous middle class, but by 2001, 21 out of 36 million people
were living below the poverty level. This documentary traces the
roots of the crisis back to the irresponsible lending policies of
the international lending financial institutions. Instead of
renegotiating the external debt through official channels via the
Central Bank, government officials arranged deals directly with
seven banks. Eschewing the laws of the market they claimed to
champion, government officials assigned interest rates for bond
investment that were far higher than the true market value. The
result was the destruction of local industry, as credit became
inaccessible and the export market suffered from unfavorable terms
of trade. The inevitable default came in 2001 as a quarter of the
population was reeling from rampant unemployment and the
neo-liberals' destruction of the social safety net. A film by

<dt><b>Red Capitalism.</b></dt>
<dd>An economic revolution is turning China into the world's
largest economy. The birthplace of Chinese capitalism is Shenzhen
which has exploded from a farming village to an industrial center
of 3 million people.This film shows how Western corporations are
moving factories to Shenzhen to profit from cheap labor and join
one of the world's largest consumer markets. There are 58,000 joint
venture corporations - from Proctor &amp; Gamble to Volkswagen -
for an annual economic growth of ten percent. So desirable is it to
work in Shenzhen that the city must be patrolled to keep out the
teeming hopefuls. Scientists are working as clerks, and teachers on
assembly lines because they earn more doing menial work here. This
Mecca of free enterprise has its seamy side. Crime and prostitution
abound. Yet from Avon salesladies to manic millionaires, its
inhabitants exhibit boundless enthusiasm for the future. 1994. 60

the Chinese countryside have left for the city. 1. A factory at
Xiaolan Town, Zhongshan, Guangdong Province: Many young people from
farming communities leave home to find work in factories. 2. Yiwu

geographic location gives this city an opportunity to connect the
"world factory" to the "world market;" and local farmers' lands.
Some of them have engaged in the wholesale business, and find
themselves to be nouveaux riches, with lifestyles nothing like that
of their farming past. 3. A college town in Shanghai: In the past,
it was the promise of a good education that motivated young people
to leave their land; now, the situation has changed. 4. Another way
to change one's destiny: Join the military. 5. A village in
Luoyang, Henan Province: All young farmers have left to work in the
cities, leaving only children, women, and the elderly. Young people

<dt><b>The Other Side of Outsourcing</b></dt>
<dd>What happens when the demands of the global economy with all of
its excess baggage of Westernizing forces collides with the deeply
held traditions of an age-old culture like India's? Pulitzer
Prize-winning journalist Thomas L. Friedman heads to the heart of
the conflict and examines how this clash of cultures is affecting
the everyday lives of Indian workers, many of them young people,
who are caught in the middle. Learn how this noble, proud society
is coping with a struggle unlike any it's ever faced: balancing the
desire to benefit from the opportunities offered by the new world
market with internal efforts to protect their cultural heritage
from the eroding influence of American values. 2004. 50 min. <b>DVD

<dt><b>Shipbreakers</b></dt>
<dd>Welcome to Alang, India, the site of a gargantuan scrap yard
where ocean-going ships come to die. Forty thousand Indians live
and work here, dismembering and scavenging the hulks of 400 vessels
every year. This documentary chronicles the daily lives of the
people who work here, the barefoot men who take apart giant
mountains of steel by hand, piece by piece, as they spend months
toiling sun-up to sun-down destroying ship after ship. It is the
world's most unregulated industry. Ship owners rarely bother to
abide by the UN Base Convention, which bans shipments of
transboundary waste. One worker a day, on average, dies on the job,
from gas explosions, falls or from tons of falling steel. Still one
in four will contract cancers caused by asbestos, PCBs or other
toxic substances. 2005. 46 min. <b>DVD 5647</b></dd>

<dt><b>Advertising Missionaries</b></dt>
<dd>In Papua New Guinea, where over three quarters of the
population cannot be reached by the regular advertising mediums of
television, radio or print, "the market" must be developed by other
means. Small theater groups travel the remote highlands performing

<dt><b>Awakening</b></dt>
<dd>Documents the social and economic empowerment of women in
Afghanistan and India whose roles have traditionally been
restricted by their cultures. Awakened to new possibilities through
education and access to micro-loans these women are redefining
their roles in society. In Bihar, India's poorest state, Sister
Mary Lobo organizes village women into groups where they learn to
save small sums and invest their capital as a group. In
Afghanistan, the nation's first woman-led micro-finance institution
believes the nation's long-term success is dependent on women's
economic freedom. What is emerging in both societies is a new
economic system based on alternative values such as sharing and
collaboration, where people band together to become more
self-sufficient. c2005. 48 min. <b>DVD 618</b>1</dd>
<dt><b>Behind the Labels</b></dt>
<dd>Lured by false promises and driven by desperation, thousands of
Chinese and Filipina women pay high fees to work in garment
factories on the pacific island of Saipan, the only U.S. territory
exempt from labor and immigration laws. The clothing they sew,
bearing the "Made in the USA" label, is shipped duty and quota-free
to the U.S for sale by The GAP, J. Crew, Polo and other retailers.
Powerful hidden camera footage, along with the garment workers'
personal stories, offers a rare glimpse into indentured labor and
the workings of the global sweatshop where 14 hour shifts, payless
paydays, and lock-downs are routine. A production of the Witness
Project which uses video technology to investigate human rights
abuses. 2001. 46 min. <b>DVD 3261</b></dd>

<dt><b>The Digital Dump: Exporting Re-use and Abuse to
Africa</b></dt>
<dd>Exposes the ugly underbelly of what is thought to be an
escalating global trade in toxic, obsolete, discarded computers and
other e-scrap collected in North America and Europe and sent to
developing countries by waste brokers and so-called recyclers. In
Lagos, while there is a legitimate robust market and ability to
repair and refurbish old electronic equipment including computers,
monitors, TVs and cell phones, the local experts complain that of
the estimated 500 40-foot containers shipped to Lagos each month,
as much as 75% of the imports are "junk" and are not economically
repairable or marketable. Consequently, this e-waste, which is
legally a hazardous waste is being discarded and routinely burned
in what the environmentalists call yet "another" cyber-age
nightmare now landing on the shores of developing countries. 2004.

1984, which granted the concession to the company. The film asks:

<dt><b>Turkey's Tigers: Integrating Islam and Corporate
Culture</b></dt>
<dd>For years, Turkey has been run by a stridently secular business
and political elite, while its devout Muslim citizens have been
pushed to the political and economic fringes. But now, even the
most committed Muslims are embracing Western-style capitalism and
commerce-- and are ascending in Turkish society at the ballot box
and in big business. "Turkey's Tigers" captures this modern,
unexpected face of Islam unseen in American media. Director, Jon
Alpert [and] Matthew O'Neill ; writer, Jon Alpert. Originally
broadcast as an episode of the television program: Wide Angle.
