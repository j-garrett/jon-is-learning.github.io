<dt><b>Brave New World, The Cold War</b> (<i>People's
Century</i>)</dt>
<dd>Just over fifty years ago, Soviet and American troops met at
the River Elbe and rejoiced at the defeat of Nazi Germany but their
optimism was short lived. This film tracks the building tensions
between these two superpowers, from the post-war world of the late
1940s through the early 1960s, as the hope for peace swiftly
disintegrated into a "cold" war. Here eyewitnesses recall the
meeting on the Elbe, the impact of Stalin, Churchill and
Khrushchev, propaganda wars between the two nations, the Berlin
blockade, the Hungarian uprising and the installation of the Berlin
Wall. 1998. 56 min <b>Video/C 5552</b></dd>

the Iron Curtain, conservative Americans at all levels of society
worried about communist infiltration--especially in the movie
industry, since that medium plays a huge role in shaping public
perceptions and attitudes. This program reveals a time of
McCarthyism and career-ending blacklists, a time when freedom of

Abolition. Among the HUAC's critics shown: Presidents Roosevelt and
Truman, civil rights leader Rev. Wyatt T. Walker, Congressmen James

the 50s by CBS, though not television's first public affairs

Murrow, it was the first public affairs show to use its own film
footage instead of newsreel; no interviews were rehearsed and it
pioneered the use of field producers, who supervised the filming on
location. Its first show on Nov. 18, 1951 marked the first
commercial coast-to-coast television broadcast. c1985. 112 min.

once boasted many of Minneapolis' most lavish homes. When the
freeway tore through these two communities, the character of these
neighborhoods was changed forever. 1991. 10 min. <b>Video/C

transgression -- 2. The Uncharted landscape. In vol. 5, six movies
explore the not-so-golden years of the late fifties and early
sixties. White and Chicano gangs in working class L.A. call a truce
in Gang Boy. Robert's downward spiral in The Dropout includes a
stint in the malt shop waiting on his one-time peers and The
Terrible truth is that nice girls get hooked on "horse". Vol. 6 is
a rare visual record of the changing face of urban and rural
America, the blank slate upon which fantasies of growth and
prosperity were enacted. In the Suburbs celebrates the swingin'
white suburban dream (a paradise for advertisers), and in American
Harvest the exploitation of our bountiful natural resources
culminates in...a Chevrolet. <b>Compu/D 347</b></dd>

learn to be true to their sex in the inflexible fifties. The Home
Economics story points out that "cooking is practically applied
chemistry," and dinette doubles as darkroom when Mike's
photographer wife solves those pesky two-career problems by
quitting her job. Vol. 8 documents the growth of mass advertising
and its migration from movie theaters to television. These sweet
and subtle precursors to the infomercial include the journey of an
animated drop of gasoline through the fuel-efficient 1935 Chevrolet
and "RFD Greenwich Village," a suburban oasis where the modern
villager relaxes in mod duds of all-cotton corduroy. <b>Compu/D

pioneered the use of field producers, who supervised the filming on

<dt><b>Sex, Censorship and the Silver Screen: The 1950s and
'60s</b></dt>
<dd>After World War II, the wholesomeness of American movies faced
a tidal wave of change--from outside, as a growing number of
provocative foreign films made their way to the U.S., and from
within, as car culture flowered and drive-in theaters sprang up
across the country. This program documents the period, from the
birth of art house cinema to the ascent of boundary-busting
American actresses such as Ingrid Bergman, Brigitte Bardot, Sophia
Loren, Marilyn Monroe and directors like Marlon Brando and Stanley
Kubrick. Studying the shifting moral standards that Hollywood,
Italian cinema, and the French New Wave signaled--and which the
Catholic Legion of Decency resisted tooth and nail. The 1952
Supreme Court decision granting First Amendment protection to
motion pictures is also highlighted. Dist.: <a href=

<dt><b>Coming Apart: Picture This.</b> <i>(Century: Events that
Shaped the World; 10.)</i></dt>
<dd>In the late 1940's, while the Soviet Union and the U.S. eyed
each other over the Iron Curtain, conservative Americans at all
levels of society worried about communist infiltration--especially
in the movie industry, since that medium plays a huge role in
shaping public perceptions and attitudes. This program reveals a
time of McCarthyism and career-ending blacklists, a time when
freedom of speech itself became a casualty in the desperate fight
to protect democracy from "The red menace." 43 min. <b>Video/C

<dt><b>Committee on Un-American Activities</b></dt>
<dd>The first film by a private citizen which criticizes a US
government committee, includes 1930s footage of House Un-American
Activities Committee (HUAC) Chairman Martin Dies (D) of Texas
attacking "subversives" in labor unions; the Hollywood Witch Hunts;
the Cold War blacklistings; and the 1960 San Francisco hearings.
The film contains an analysis of how the HUAC subpoened the
newsfilms of the City Hall protests from TV stations KRON &amp;
KPIX and used federal facilities to edit them into "Operation
Abolition. Among the HUAC's critics shown: Presidents Roosevelt and
Truman, civil rights leader Rev. Wyatt T. Walker, Congressmen James
Roosevelt &amp; Phillip Burton, and Frank Wilkinson. Freedom of
Information Act files also reveal that the HUAC, in violation of
the First Amendment, investigated Robert Carl Cohen for making this
film. Archival sound reproductions supplied by KPFA-Radio
(Berkekely, Cal.); archival images supplied by KRON-TV and KPIX-TV

<dt><b>A Crime to Fit the Punishment</b></dt>
<dd>In 1956, during the height of the Cold War and despite severe
pressure from McCarthy ravaged Hollywood and the U.S. government,
blacklisted filmmakers joined together to create the controversial
pro-union semi-documentary Salt of the earth. This film
investigates the background and political atmosphere surrounding
the film's production through interviews with the film producer
Paul Jarrico and actors, newsreels from the '50s, and clips from
the film. 1992. 46 min. Video/C 9289</dd>

<dt><b>Edward R. Murrow Collection: The McCarthy Years.</b></dt>
<dd>Narrated by Walter Cronkite, this documentary turns back the
clock to the 1950s, a time when the country lurched into a murky
period of blacklists and witch-hunts for alleged communists, all
led by a young Senator named Joseph McCarthy. Murrow made a
controversial series of broadcasts that challenge McCarthy's abuses
of power, which -- as this program investigates -- signaled the
emergence of television news as a highly influential force in
American life. <b>DVD 4009; also VHS Video/C 3167</b></dd>

a Harry Truman, or, before that, of a Franklin Roosevelt, or
subsequently of a Lyndon Johnson, are not seen as that offensive."

front; the "traditional family" takes center stage. Milestones
include: the arms race between the U.S. and U.S.S.R.; Senator

<dd>Between 1945 and the early 50's the lives of thousands of
ordinary citizens were destroyed because they were accused of
un-American activities. Teachers, writers, anyone who expressed a
liberal opinion could be accused. In this film both the
anti-Communists and the victims of the notorious McCarthy
witchhunts talk candidly about the era of anti-Communist hysteria
and blacklists. Among them we meet men and women who did join the
Communist Party out of idealism and in reaction to injustices in
American society and lawyer Arthur Kinoy who recalls his efforts to
stay the execution of the Rosenbergs, which marked the culmination
of the hysteria. 1992. 50 min. <b>DVD X8637</b></dd>

the political machine to run as a wild card candidate in the
upcoming gubernatorial race. But, when Willie realizes that he is
being manipulated, he veers off on his own to become the darling of
the electorate's downtrodden and forgotten hicks. Covering the
campaign for a local paper is Jack Burden, whose editorial pieces
become so admiring of Willie that he's fired. But, when Stark wins,
Burden hires onto the new governor's team as a personal aide. Once
in office, Governor Stark antagonizes the state legislature, the
oil companies, and the moneyed classes with his share-the-wealth
promises to the sweaty masses. Legislators become so outraged that
they start serious impeachment talk, a move supported by the
admired and retired Judge Irwin, who also happens to be Jack's

Joseph McCarthy and the House Un-American Activities Committee.

pressures to examine the lies and scaremongering tactics
perpetrated by McCarthy during his communist 'witch-hunts'. A very

the CBS crew carries on and their tenacity will prove historic and
