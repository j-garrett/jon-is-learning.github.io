<dt><b>The 70s Dimension</b></dt>
<dd>TV commercials, promotional spots, and public service
announcements were produced on 16mm, spooled onto mini-reels, and
projected into a film-chain for telecast. They usually had a
limited shelf life and were considered disposable. After a brief
rotation on the air, most of them were discarded, never to be seen
again. This production is a salvaged collection from the 1970s of
ads, information clips, and PSA's as found in their original 16mm
format that offer a glimpse into a history that was never meant to
be remembered.</dd>

<dt><b>Smokin': Classic Cigarette Commercials.</b></dt>
<dd>There was a time when cigarette smoking was considered healthy,
endorsed by doctors, an accepted social occurrence and cigarette
commercials were everywhere. This compilation of classic
commercials from the 50's and 60's covers all the bases ... doctor
endorsements, comedy, social events and smoking in the workplace.
The commercials provide cautionary insights into how people will
buy into anything and how pervasive peer pressure can be. Contents:
