"10" height="10">Lecture 5. From Lexington and Concord to Yorktown
-- Lecture 6. Radicalism of the American Revolution -- Lecture 7.
Slave rebellion in St. Dominigue -- Lecture 8. Haitian Revolution.
<u>From Lexington and Concord to Yorktown</u>: Covers the fighting
during the American Revolution from Lexington and Concord to the
British surrender at Yorktown in 1781, an extraordinary story of a
small group of colonials challenging and defeating the most
powerful empire in the world. <u>Radicalism of the American
Revolution</u>: Discusses the "meaning" of the American Revolution.
For some, it was a conservative effort by planters to sieze power
and control the development of a society already divided between
slaves and free men, white and non-whites, and the landed and
landless. For others, it represented a radical break with a
monarchical past and a move towards a republic and democratic
politics. <u>Slave rebellion in St. Dominigue</u>: The Haitain
revolution is the only successful slave rebellion in the Americas.
This section and the next analyze the only case of slaves rising
up, taking power, and creating an independent nation. Also looks at
the French revolution and its influence on Saint Domingue, a
classic example of the sugar and slave plantation complex in the
Americas. <u>Haitian Revolution</u>: In 1791, thousands of slaves
rose up in St. Domingue, in a war for their freedom. Amidst the
violence, a group of black leaders emerged, the most famous the
former slave Toussaint L'Ouverture. Over more than a decade the
slaves defeated invading armies from France, England, and Spain,
but the black leadership eventually turned against itself in a
struggle for control of the revolution. <b>Video/C MM284</b></dd>

America -- Lecture 10. Napoleon invades Spain and Portugal --
Lecture 11. Francisco de Miranda: the precursor -- Lecture 12:
Simon Bolivar: the liberator. <u>Seeds of the rebellion in Spanish
America</u>: Looks at a series of wars for independence in Spanish
America. By 1750, the Spanish Empire in the Americas had been in
place for two and a half centuries. In the mid-18th century, the
Bourbon dynasty embarked on a series of reforms to revitalize the
Spanish Empire which became the source of grievances by the Creoles
and their motivation to break with Spain. <u>Napoleon invades Spain
and Portugal</u>: The Napoleonic wars and in particular Napoleon's
invasion of Spain, triggered a series of mostly failed wars for
independence in Spanish America after 1808. The defeat of Napoleon
and the return of Fernando VII in 1814 created another flashpoint
that set off a second series of wars in Spanish America that were
largely successful. <u>Francisco de Miranda, the precursor</u>:
Looks at the dramatic life of Francisco de Miranda whose life and
work foreshadowed the generation of revolutonary leaders in Latin
America who would lead the wars for independence. He became the
early mentor of the most famous of these liberators -- Simon
Bolivar. <i>Simon Boliver, the liberator</i>: This segment looks
closely at the life of the revolutionary figure, Simon Bolivar,
from his birth in Venezuela in 1783 to his first forays into
politics and war in 1810. Once in power, Bolivar was never able to
provide the stability needed by the new republics. He eventually
returned to Europe, committing his life to the liberation of his
fellow Americans. <b>Video/C MM285</b></dd>

Lecture 14. San Martin and Argentine independence. -- Lecture 15.
Bernardo O'Higgins and Chile. -- Lecture 16. Liberting Peru.
<u>Liberating Northern South America</u>: With the imprisonment and
eventual death of Miranda, Simon Boliver assumed the mantle of the
leader of the South American independence movement. The liberation
of Venezuela and the rest of northern South America, including
Colombia, and Ecuador, proved to be a bloody and drawn out struggle
that would last more than a decade. <u>San Martin and Argentine
independence</u>: Jose de San Martin is the counterpart of Simon
Bolivar in southern South America. This segment focuses on the
process of independence in Argentina and Uruguay and the figure of
San Martin and his leadership of the armies that liberated southern
South America. <u>Bernardo O'Higgins and Chile</u>: Looks at the
military hero Bernardo O'Higgins and his emergence as a leader in
Chile after 1810. Follows the virtual civil war in Chile as Creoles
vied for control and Spaniards attempted to crush the moves toward
independence. Concludes with O'Higgins flight to Argentina, his
relationship with Jose de San Martin, and the heroic march of their
combined forces through the Andes to liberate Chile from the
Spanish. <u>Liberating Peru</u>: The liberation of Peru, the great
Spanish stronghold in South America, commencing in 1822 came from
two directions: led by Simon Bolivar from the North and Jose de San
Martin from the South. Bolivar led the final assult liberating Peru
and upper Peru (Bolivia) with the assistance of his lieutenant,
Jose Antonio de Sucre. <b>Video/C MM286</b></dd>

Lecture 18. Mexico: empire and chaos -- Lecture 19. Brazil: a royal
revolution? -- Lecture 20. Failed movements in the Caribbean.
<u>Mexico: race and class warfare</u>: The war for Mexican
independence took place in two stages. This segments looks at the
first stage, a race and class war in 1810. Two priests, Miguel
Hidalgo and Jose Maria Morelos, led an uprising of poor people,
largely Indians, and threatened to annihilate the upper-class
whites, who closed ranks to defeat the insurgency and restore
order. <u>Mexico, empire and chaos</u>: Events in Europe sparked
the second war for independence in Mexico when the supporters of a
liberal constitution triumphed in Spain in 1820. A so-called
"conservative compromise" avoided bloodshed and brokered Mexican
independence when the Spanish general, Agustin de Iturbide, came
over to the side of independence in 1821. Crowned Emperor Agustin
I, he was quickly deposed and Mexico slid into a half century of
political chaos. <u>Brazil: a royal revolution?</u>: Escaping the
Napoleonic Wars, the Braganza royal family of Portugal settled in
Rio de Janeiro and ruled its vast empire from Brazil. King Joao VI
elevated Brazil to the status of a kingdom, diffusing most desires
for separation and independence. When Joao returned to Portugal in
1821, the crown prince Pedro, remained in Brazil, assumed the
leadership of the movement to separate from Portugal, and declared
Brazil's independence in 1822. <u>Failed movements in the
Caribbean</u>: Some of the American colonies did not achieve
independence in the age of revolutions. This segment looks at Cuba
and Puerto Rico, two colonies in Spanish America that failed to
achieve their independence. Also examines the troubled case of the
Dominican Republic, a nation that had to fight several times, first
against Spain and then Haiti, to achieve its independence.

Lecture 22. The strange case of Paraguay -- Lecture 23. Revolutions
made and unmade -- Lecture 24. Aftermath of independence.
<u>British West Indies and Canada</u>: Canada and the British
possessions in the West Indies did not seek independence. Both
regions experienced a gradual transition to independence that
presents a fascinating comparison to both the British North America
and Latin American experience. <u>Strange case of Paraguay</u>:
When the first set of wars for independence broke out in the La
Plata region in 1808, a strong man, Jose Gaspar de Francia, emerged
as the authoritarian leader of independence and the new nation.
Unlike the rest of Latin America, in the aftermath of independence,
Paraguay turned inward and isolated itself from the outside world
until the mid-19th century. <u>Revolutions made and unmade</u>:
This segment looks at the "big picture," of the age of revolutions
and the general processes across all of the Americas, comparing all
the revolutions. In particular, focuses on how the differing
colonial traditions (political, economic and cultural) shaped the
revolutionary paths and the outcomes of the wars for independence.
<u>Aftermath of independence</u>: Examines the larger vision of the
Americas in the aftermath of the wars for independence, beginning
with the key concepts of revolution and emphasizing the complex
nature of the different wars for independence, as well as their
common patterns. Concludes with a summary of the legacies of the
wars and revolutions, in particular comparing the United States in
roughly 1850 with Latin America. <b>Video/C MM287</b></dd>

<dt><b>Birdsong and Coffee: A Wake Up Call</b></dt>
<dd>Explores the inextricable economic and environmental
connections between farmers in Latin America, coffee drinkers in
the U.S., and the fate of migratory songbirds throughout the
Americas. Part 1 of the film examines the background and global
intricacy of the "coffee crisis," an ongoing situation that has
been described as a "humanitarian catastrophe." To illustrate, we
meet coffee growers in the rainforest of southern Costa Rica, whose
lives vividly exemplify the unjust effects of global market
mechanisms that keep coffee growers' prices down even as the retail
prices for coffee increase in the U.S. Part two examines a variety
of simple but effective solutions to the coffee crisis and explains
the rationale behind and the importance of fair trade coffee.

<dd>In his lifetime Carlos Fuentes has witnessed the rediscovery of
ancient Aztec temples beneath the central square of modern Mexico
City. He retraces the Indian world through their magnificent
pyramids and sculptures. The return of their exiled god was
forecast for the very year Cort&eacute;s reached their shores. The
savagery of the conquistador equaled that of the Indian, but he
brought with him a new god, a god who sacrificed himself for men.

<dd>The New World brought Spain enormous treasures: gold, silver,
chocolate, tomatoes, the potato. Yet Spain's most powerful ruler,
Philip II, lived in austere solitude in a cell-like study. He
sought to protect the Catholic faith, while Cervantes questioned
all values in Don Quixote. Vel&aacute;zquez painted masterpieces of
psychological penetration that vaulted the Atlantic. 59 min. <b>DVD

<dd>Every year a million Mexicans gather in their capital to
celebrate El Grito, the cry for independence. Following its
progress, Carlos Fuentes crosses the Andes in the steps of
Bol&iacute;var and San Mart&iacute;n. The liberators succeeded in
throwing off the Spanish yoke, but they found it harder to
establish a just society. For the gaucho there was the consolation
of the open spaces, the mountains, and the plains. And for those
crowding into the new cities like Buenos Aires, there was tango, a
sad thought that can be danced. 59 min. <b>DVD X5716; vhs Video/C

<dd>An overview of the Mexican Revolution and its impact on the

contributions by Mexican-Americans in the areas of art, business,
and education. The program provides excellent insight into the
roots of anti-Mexican sentiment, as well as the often quarrelsome
relationship between the U.S. and Mexico from a historical
perspective. Originally produced in 1994 for the television

<dd>Defines Mexico City's globalization in terms of winners and
losers, examining how, in the world's largest metropolis,
immigration challenges are linked to poverty and population influx

between foreign investment and the worldwide need for cheap labor,
which Mexico and its indigenous peoples readily supply. Glimpses
into a tech-savvy youth culture and the persistent Zapatista
movement reinforce the capital's nickname: City of Contrasts.

Fantasy (Meksikanskaya fantasiya)</a></b>(Russia, 1998)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Oleg Kovalov. Left unfinished by Eisenstein, the
film (originally to be titled: Que viva Mexico and produced in
1938)) was highly structured, and was to consist of four "novellas"
or "scenarios" plus a prologue and epilogue. The precise order and
content of these episodes was constantly changing, but the overall
film would trace the history of Mexico from precolonial times
through Spanish conquest to contemporary times. Each episode has
its own distinct style, is dedicated to a different Mexican artist,
and also bases itself on some primal element (stone, water, iron,
fire, air). The soundtrack in each case features a different
Mexican folk song. A very rare film, this is not a re-working by
another filmmaker, but the original film itself. 100 min. <b>DVD

(Havanna -- Die Neue Kunst Ruinen zu Bauen)</b></font></dt>
<dd><font color="#33CCFF">In recent years, Havana has become famous
all over the world for the morbid charm of its flaking facades. But
these ruins are far less poetic for the people who inhabit them.
Houses frequently collapse causing fatalities. This unique
documentary tells the stories of the people who reside in these
modern ruins, from a homeless man who lives in an abandoned
theater, to an expropriated landowner who struggles against the
decay of his parental home, to a writer who conceives a philosophy
of the ruins to explain the gradual collapse of the city and its
political system. A mixture of private history, memories, fears and
hopes for the future, this documentary explores the quixotic
relationship between man and architecture, man and ruins
(commenting along the way on the ruin-tourism that has developed in
Cuba). Spanning the entire history of Cuban architecture, from the
colonial era up through the socialist revolution, this film
captures the final moments of these historic buildings before
they're renovated -- or simply collapse altogether. A film by
Florian Borchmeyer and Matthias Hentschler. Dist. <a href=

Cuban propaganda film first exhibited outside of Cuba and the

events which led to the success of the revolution under Fidel
Castro. In the first film a poor, Havana girl loses herself in the
decadent night life of the city and becomes a prostitute serving
American tourists; in the second, an old farmer who is about to be
evicted from his land by the United Fruit Company sets fire to his
house and cane fields and collapses in despair; in the third,
university students demonstrate and plot against the government,
and are martyred; and in the last an ignorant campesino, driven
from his home by Batista's forces, sees the light and follows it to
a rebel camp where Fidel's troops welcome him. Special features on

<dd><font color="#33CCFF">Directed by former Haitian Minister of
Culture Raoul Peck. After the massive earthquake that struck in
January 2010, killing an estimated 250,000 and leaving 1.2 million
homeless, a flood of aid and agencies arrived at Haiti's door. Some
had an agenda to help, others had an agenda to protect their own
assets and interests. Three years later, what state has this aid
left the Haitian people in? Peck unveils the true face of
international aid as a failure full of organizational ineptitude,
broken promises and hidden agendas, painting a vivid picture that
the "aid" of foreign powers is more realistically an occupation.

<dd><font color="#33CCFF">From WWI to the 1990s, 10,000 Caribbean
men were chosen yearly by American sugar corporations to harvest
sugar cane for six months in Florida under temporary "H-2" visas.
This film exposes the brutal, systematic exploitation of these
Jamaican guest workers by the Florida sugar cane industry. Today
this documentary provides an invaluable resource to understanding
the current debate over guest worker provisions of immigration
legislation. While Florida&rsquo;s sugar cane cutters have been
replaced by mechanical harvesters, guest worker programs have
expanded in agriculture, hotel, restaurant, forestry, and other
industries. Contents: Farm Worker Program acceptance -- A ton of
cane an hour -- "Hereditary urge" -- Not much sugar in cane -- From
barracks to bus to field -- American labor doesn't want that job --
A matter of simple arithmetic -- My turn to get cut -- The
probability is not there -- The Okeelanta strike -- See you next
season. Special features: Update on the guest worker program (19
min.); Short: "More than luck" (1 min.); Trailer: "Life and debt"
(2 min.); Audio commentary by director Stephanie Black [optional];
About Docurama [text feature]; Docurama trailers (9 min.). Produced

<dd>This documentary highlights the activism of H.I.J.O.S.--a group
made up of the sons and daughters of those killed or gone missing
at the hands of the Argentine military between 1976 and 1983.
Memories of the vanished generation, known as the Desaparecidos,
have been kept alive by their surviving children (hijos), some of
whom were merely days old when their parents disappeared. Until
these young people began to organize and demand explanations from
their government, the predominant coping strategy had been to
pretend that the missing are still alive. The grief of young
Argentines erupts into public action, and becomes a cornerstone for
social movements from South America to Serbia. Directed and edited

<dt><b>May Justice Be Done</b></dt>
<dd>By any standard Argentina was a very rich country until the
1970s, with competitive industries, modern agriculture, and a
prosperous middle class, but by 2001, 21 out of 36 million people
were living below the poverty level. This documentary traces the
roots of the crisis back to the irresponsible lending policies of
the international lending financial institutions. Instead of
renegotiating the external debt through official channels via the
Central Bank, government officials arranged deals directly with
seven banks. Eschewing the laws of the market they claimed to
champion, government officials assigned interest rates for bond
investment that were far higher than the true market value. The

<dd>This documentary is about landless farmers in northeastern
Brazil who, with great dignity and tremendous humor, struggle for
their economic survival, and to preserve the imaginative and
regenerative power of their culture. For these farmers, descended
from the native Indians, the "roca," the place where plants,
vegetables and rice are grown, thereby assuring a family's future,
could be paradise on earth if this land belonged to them. A place
from which all their myths have spring and will spring, and which
they struggle to maintain by poetry, music, clay creations and
dance, so as to transmit this "way of life" to their children.

However, in recent years, the country has developed more of a

an entire industry built on corruption. Illustrates how corruption
and kidnapping represent two sides of the same violent crime.

the economic policy, while the gap between rich and poor grew. The
resulting huge debt has caused an even greater emphasis on the
export of food, causing shortages and higher prices in Brazil.

<dd>General Augusto Pinochet seized power in Chile in a 1973
military coup and banned political parties, closed newspapers, and
spread fear throughout the country as disappearances, torture and

Chileans to oppose the dictator for the first time. Copper miners
called for a nonviolent national protest day against Pinochet.
Mainstream opposition parties re-ermerged after ten years and
staged frequent non-violent demonstrations. They realized that the
constitution Pinochet wrote in 1980 called for a plebicite--a
chance for people to vote yes or no on another eight years of
military rule. Pinochet had always assumed he would win but the
opposition ran a bold, future-oriented "NO" campaign and in 1988
Pinochet was voted out. Dist.: <a href="http://www.films.com">Films

men were taken from their homes never to return. Since that time,
Chilean women have danced the country's traditional courtship dance
alone, and 'La Cueca Sola' has become a symbol of women's struggle
against the dictatorship. After 30 years in exile, filmmaker Marilu
Mallet returns to Santiago to meet with five Chilean women who
suffered under the dictatorship and have emerged as heroes under
democracy. Isabel Allende, Monique Hermosilla, Estela Ortiz,
Carolina Toha and Moyenei Valdes all lost a father, a husband, or a

<dt><b>The Evolution of Chile: Prosperity for Some</b></dt>
<dd>In 25 years, Chile has gone from a Marxist state to a
dictatorship to a democracy. The transition has strengthened
Chile's economy, but not all Chilean citizens have shared in the
prosperity. As divisions between rich and poor widen, critics
question whether democratic capitalism is the right solution. Using
Chile as a case study, this program examines how Chile and other
Third World nations are riding the tidal wave of post-Cold War
economic reforms. c1998. 29 min. <b>Video/C 8679</b></dd>

<dd>From his childhood in Valparaiso to his suicide following the

<dt><b>Under Rich Earth</b></dt>
<dd>"The Intag valley of Ecuador is a lush and fertile paradise
inhabited by strong-willed and resourceful family farmers. Three
generations of families have carved out a hard but good life in
this remote frontier. While they don't earn much cash for their
work, they own rich land, which is the greatest security for their
children and for future generations. Under Rich Earth is a feature
length documentary that follows family farmers in the Intag valley
who resist what they consider to be the invasion of their land by
foreign prospectors. Victor, Rosario, Robinson, Marcia and Carlos
are among hundreds of people who join together to stop outsiders
from transforming their beloved valley into what a Canadian mining
company says will inevitably become a 'world class' copper mine.
Facing the prospect of losing their precious land and forests, the
farmers are ready to give up their lives. But is their conviction
matched by the tenacity of those who want to undermine them?"

heterophonic sound without rhythmic beat, harmony, or counterpoint

<dt><b>With the Poor of the Earth</b>D</dt>
<dd>This documentary graphically shows the contradiction between
the 80 percent of Venezuelans who live in poverty and the vast
potential wealth of that country. The ongoing revolutionary process
is examined from its beginnings in the 1980s to first anniversary
of the April 2002 coup against the democratically elected
government of Hugo Chavez Frias. The role of the U.S. government
and the media is also highlighted. Through interviews, music, and
footage from across the country, the profound social and economic
changes taking place in Venezuela come to life, with emphasis on
the participation of Venezuela's millions of poor in the
revolutionary process. Directed by Luis Acevedo Fals. 2003. 57 min.
