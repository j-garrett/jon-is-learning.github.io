Washington.</dd>

<dt><b>[Williams, Arleigh Taber] Dean of Students Arleigh Williams:
The Free Speech Movement and the Six Years War, 1964-1970: Oral
History Transcript</b></dt>
<dd>Interviews conducted by Germaine LaBerge; introductions by Ray
Colvig and Frank Thatcher. Berkeley, Calif.: University of
California, c1990. Williams directed student activities for the
ASUC (1957-1959)before becoming dean of men at Berkeley. He
witnessed the beginnings of the Free Speech Movement as the
Bancroft Avenue strip became a testing ground for student activists
in the 1960s. He speaks about the ideals of the students and their
protests in connection with free speech, the Vietnam War, and
People's Park. It was his responsibility to carry out the
administration's policies and often mete out discipline. His
fairness and willingness to listen brought a balance to many
difficult situations. In addition, he describes a typical day in
the Dean of Students Office, focusing on the needs of
students--tutorial help, housing, child care, access for physically
disabled, transportation, etc. He also discusses his relationships
with Chancellors Edward Strong, Roger Heyns, and Albert Bowker.
Ruth Williams, the dean's wife, contributes a family perspective on
the Free Speech Movement. She was president of Faculty Wives and an
active participant in student work throughout her husband's career
at the University.</dd>
