<dt><b>Army of One</b></dt>
<dd>A documentary following the lives of three young people who
joined the U.S. Army in the wake of 9/11. In stark contrast to the
portraits of willing patriotic soldiers that America sells at home
and abroad, these recruits' stories reveal the more realistic,
troubled conflict of American youth trapped within a military
mission much larger than themselves. 2003. 71 min. A film by Sarah
Goodman <b>DVD 1704</b></dd>
<dt><b>Basic Training</b> (1971)</dt>
<dd>Filmed at Fort Knox in 1970, this documentary follows a company
of draftees and enlisted men through the Army basic training
program, showing the transition from civilians to soldiers. A film
by Frederick Wiseman. c1971. 90 min. <b>DVD X7232; Video/C
MM509</b></dd>
<dt><b>The Battle of Glorieta Pass.</b></dt>
<dd>Using commentary from diaries and journals of Civil War
participants film reviews the military strategy and events
surrounding the Battle of Glorieta Pass during the New Mexico Civil
War campaign of 1862. <b>Video/C 2868</b></dd>
<dt><b>Before you Enlist!: The Real Deal on Joining the
Military</b></dt>
<dd>Through interviews with American veterans, this documentary
provides a rational voice to counter the seductive and often
deceptive recruiting practices of the U.S. military. The message is
not "don't enlist" but rather seeks to provide young people and
their families with a more complete picture of the life-altering
consequences of joining the military. Produced by Telequest, Inc.
with support from the American Friends Service Committee and
Veterans for Peace. 2006. 14 min. <b>DVD 6539</b></dd>
<dt><b>Bulletproof Salesman</b></dt>
<dd>In a career spanning two decades of global turmoil, Fidelis
Cloer, a self-proclaimed war profiteer, has supplied kings,
presidents, and dictators with the finest armored vehicles that
money can buy. In his world, where security is a commodity,
violence and war present sales opportunities just as rain sells
umbrellas. Following the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Cloer sold
thousands of his hand-crafted armored vehicles. But as the war
evolved, and armor-defeating Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs)
proliferated, Cloer found himself engaged in an arms race with
insurgents who upped their explosives ante to defeat his
increasingly higher (and more expensive) levels of armor.
Directors, Petra Epperlein, Michael Tucker. 2008. 14 min. <b>DVD

<dt><b>Car Bomb: A History of the Deadliest Weapon of the
Century</b></dt>
<dd>Forget about nuclear missiles, the decisive weapon of the
twentieth century is the car bomb. We now know you can defeat a
superpower, start a civil war, or just blow up your own government
with a trunkload of homemade explosives and a battered old car.
From the Middle East to Oklahoma, Afghanistan, and most recently
New York's Times Square, the car bomb has shaped human conflict.
Ex-CIA agent Robert Baer uncovers the history of this extraordinary
weapon. Includes shocking footage of car bomb attacks and
penetrating interviews with car bombers. Directed by Kevin Toolis.

<dt><b>A Child's Century of War</b></dt>
<dd>From the perspective of children, takes the viewer on a journey
through the past century, examining the way in which modern wars
have increasingly threatened and targeted children. Three
contemporary conflicts are at the heart of the film. Telling their
stories in their own voices, we hear from orphans of the two recent
Chechen wars, from children in Hebron on the West Bank and from the
abducted, raped and amputated children of Sierra Leone. c2001. 90

Moonlight Maze moved from the Russian Academy of Science and into
the U.S. Department of Defense. A new form of warfare has broken
out and the battleground is cyberspace. With weapons like embedded
malicious code, probes and pings, there are surgical strikes,
reverse neutron bombs, and the potential for massive assaults aimed
directly at America's infrastructure -- the power grid, the water
supply, the complex air traffic control system, and the nation's
railroads. Thie film investigates just how real the threat of war
in cyberspace is and reveals what the White House knows that the
rest of us don't. Written and directed by Michael Kirk. c2003. 60

James Lawson offered free evening classes on nonviolent action to
university students in Nashville with the goal of training and
preparing them to desegregate the city's business district. Lawson
had spent three years in India learning about Mohandas Gandhi. Now
he guided his students in a study of both the history and practice
of nonviolent methods--to prepare them for their "sit-ins" at
downtown stores. Lawson's guidance helps the students endure the
beatings and arrests, and lead a boycott, as they bring their
stuggle for civil rights to the steps of Nashville City Hall and
ultimately to the forefront of national attention. 33 min. <b>DVD

nationalists were impatient with British foot-dragging on promises
to move India toward self-rule, and appointed Mohandas Gandhi to
lead "the final struggle for freedom." Relying on nonviolent
methods he developed in South Africa, Gandhi empowered millons who
followed his example and his campaign of civil disobedience swept
the country, forcing the British to admit that their regime was
losing control. 2000. 30 min. <b>DVD 1952; also VHS Video/C

South Africa a black "uprising" against the injustice of apartheid
began in 1984. Many young blacks knew they could not win by violent
force. Instead they organized at the grassroots-taking control of
their own townships and making their grievances known to the white
population. By withholding their buying power, the black population
drove a wedge between the white business community and the
apartheid regime. A nationwide state of emergency was imposed and
continued for three years. In 1989, a new president F. W. De Klerk,
released Nelson Mandela and negotiated a new constitution, which
guaranteed equal rights for all South Africans. 33 min. <b>DVD

Hitler's forces invaded Denmark on April 9, 1940, the Danish
government knew that a military response would be suicidal for
Denmark's small armed forces. Danish leaders decided to adopt a
strategy of resistance disguised as collaboration. By delaying and
obstructing German operations, Danes systematically undermined the
invaders' objectives. In the end, Denmark did not defeat Germany,
but it survived and it contributed more to the war effort through
nonviolent resistance than Danish arms could ever have achieved. 30

August, 1980, workers at the Gdansk shipyard went on strike. Lech
Walesa was the chief negotiator for the workers, who avoided the
mistakes of earlier strikes by maintaining strict nonviolent
discipline--and by occupying their shipyard, to deter a violent
crackdown by authorities. The strike quickly spread throughout the
country and a new union was born named "Solidarity." The government
imposed martial law and banned the union which continued its work
underground until 1989 when it re-emerged as a revitalized
political force, and won decisively in Poland's first free
elections in 60 years. 31 min. <b>DVD 1955; also VHS Video/C

Augusto Pinochet seized power in Chile in a 1973 military coup and
banned political parties, closed newspapers, and spread fear
throughout the country as disappearances, torture and imprisonment
became common. In 1983, an economic crisis pushed many Chileans to
oppose the dictator for the first time. Copper miners called for a
nonviolent national protest day against Pinochet. Mainstream
opposition parties re-ermerged after ten years and staged frequent
non-violent demonstrations. They realized that the constitution
Pinochet wrote in 1980 called for a plebicite--a chance for people
to vote yes or no on another eight years of military rule. Pinochet
had always assumed he would win but the opposition ran a bold,
future-oriented "NO" campaign and in 1988 Pinochet was voted out.

on Terror' in New York and Iraq. Spanning five continents, filming
took over two years to document the story of how men and women are
working to resist getting caught up in the current global conflict.

<dt><b>Inside America's Empire</b></dt>
<dd>The challenge of terrorism is likely to last for generations,
and in a war without definable geographic borders or clear-cut
victories, the threat may crop up anywhere. This documentary
illuminates how the U.S. military is confronting this complicated
challenge in unexpected and innovative ways, as chronicled by
military correspondent Robert D. Kaplan of The Atlantic. Kaplan
takes viewers to the Philippines, Mali, Colombia and the Republic
of Georgia to meet the commanders and grunts on the ground who are
waging the war on terror, often acting more as humanitarians than
as warriors. Kaplan makes the case that this engagement with the
peoples and cultures of the world -- offering logistical support,
humanitarian aid and weapons training -- is integral to America's
security and future prosperity. Originally broadcast as a segment

John Pilger's new film is a powerful and timely investigation into
the media's role in war. The War You Don't See traces the history

developed into an `electronic battlefield'. But who is the real

The North American revolution emerges. <u>Revolutions and wars for
independence</u>: Sets the major themes of the video series, along
with a discussion of the concepts of "revolution" and "wars for
independence.". <u>Origins of revolution in the Atlantic world</u>:
Looks at the most important transformations that shaped the
Atlantic world by the mid-18th century, including the
Enlightenment, developing commerce and trade, the industrial
revolution and new political theories which ushered in an age of
political revolutions. <i>Colonial empires on the eve of
revolution</i>: Between 1492 and 1750, the Spanish, Portuguese,
French, and English had carved out large colonial empires. This
lecture surveys those colonial empires, their dimensions and
characteristics in 1750. <u>North American revolution emerges</u>:
In the dissimilar American colonies, a sense of unity emerged out
of the colonial wars that the English fought, especially with the
French in the 1750s and 1760s. These decades precipitated the
emergence of a sense of an "American" identity among the English
colonists, eventually resulting in a move towards independence in
1775 and 1776. <b>Video/C MM283</b></dd>

Slave rebellion in St. Dominigue -- Lecture 8. Haitian Revolution.
<u>From Lexington and Concord to Yorktown</u>: Covers the fighting
during the American Revolution from Lexington and Concord to the
British surrender at Yorktown in 1781, an extraordinary story of a
small group of colonials challenging and defeating the most
powerful empire in the world. <u>Radicalism of the American
Revolution</u>: Discusses the "meaning" of the American Revolution.
For some, it was a conservative effort by planters to sieze power
and control the development of a society already divided between
slaves and free men, white and non-whites, and the landed and
landless. For others, it represented a radical break with a
monarchical past and a move towards a republic and democratic
politics. <u>Slave rebellion in St. Dominigue</u>: The Haitain
revolution is the only successful slave rebellion in the Americas.
This section and the next analyze the only case of slaves rising
up, taking power, and creating an independent nation. Also looks at
the French revolution and its influence on Saint Domingue, a
classic example of the sugar and slave plantation complex in the
Americas. <u>Haitian Revolution</u>: In 1791, thousands of slaves
rose up in St. Domingue, in a war for their freedom. Amidst the
violence, a group of black leaders emerged, the most famous the
former slave Toussaint L'Ouverture. Over more than a decade the
slaves defeated invading armies from France, England, and Spain,
but the black leadership eventually turned against itself in a
struggle for control of the revolution. <b>Video/C MM284</b></dd>

"10" height="10"> <b>Explosion.</b> The World War of 1914 to 1918,
the Great War, was the first of the major catastrophes of the 20th
century. This episode, the first of eight, examines the causes of
World War I. The program affords coverage of the assassination of
the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the turbulent political
climate throughout Europe as factors which led to the outbreak of
war. <b>Video/C 5256</b></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10"> <b>Stalemate.</b>This program examines the
military operations of 1914, with emphasis on the Western Front.
Almost from the outset, World War I became a stalemate with a line
of trenches stretching from the Swiss Alps to the English Channel.
This episode, the second of eight, explores why the war devolved
into one of trench warfare. <b>Video/C 5256</b></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10"> <b>Total War.</b> This episode of the Great War,
the third of eight, examines the evolution of World War I from a
conflict fought across the landscape of Europe to a global war.
Coverage is afforded events in Great Britain and Turkey. The use of
terror in modern war and the evolution of "total war" -- especially
regarding aerial and chemical weapons -- is explored in this
program. <b>Video/C 5257</b></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10"> <b>Slaughter</b>. This episode, the fourth of
eight, examines the military operations of the Western Front
through the eyes of the soldiers who manned the trenches and fought
the battles. Through study of the battles of Verdun, the Somme and
Passchendaele, a social portrait of the common soldier is developed
and analyzed. <b>Video/C 5257</b></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10"> <b>Mutiny</b>. This episode of the Great War, the
fifth of an eight part series, examines the toll that the war was
taking on the soldiers and civilians by 1917. Unrest on the
homefront and mutiny on the Western Front posed vexing problems for
political leaders and military planners. On the Eastern Front,
resentment toward the war effort would turn into rebellion and then
revolution. <b>Video/C 5258</b></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10"> <b>Collapse.</b> Episode six of the Great War
examines the critical year of 1918. After the mutiny within the
French Army and revolution in Russia, the Germans were still firmly
entrenched on the Western Front. The arrival of the United States
forces in Europe would determine the outcome of the war. This
program probes the issue of American involvement as the deciding
factor in Germany's defeat. <b>Video/C 5258</b></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10"> <b>Hatred and Hunger</b>. Episode seven of the
Great War examines the end of World War I with emphasis on
unresolved issues from the Balkans to the Middle East. World War I
brought the collapse of four empires, the death of nine million
soldiers and the ruin of much of Europe. The struggle to rebuild
lives, countries and governments would set the stage for an even
greater catastrophe a generation later. <b>Video/C 5259</b></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width=
"10" height="10"> <b>War Without End</b>. The final episode of the
Great War explores the aftermath of World War I and the failed
peace. For the "lost generation," the war would be without end as
they struggled with broken hopes, broken families and broken lives.
In Germany, the sense of betrayal and dishonor prompted some
Germans to seek revenge. The man who rose up to lead them was
Adolph Hitler. <b>Video/C 5259</b>

Seventy million soldiers from more than twenty countries marched
off to do their duty. In this film soldiers from all sides give a
personal account of the trenches and the tactics--and the terrible
nature and scale of the slaughter that shattered the old world
order. In the end, four empires collapsed and nine million gave
their lives. Some became pacificts while others sought retribution
and many found themselves fighting another war only two decades
later. 1997. 56 min. <b>Video/C 5543</b></dd>

<dd>After the First World War a whole generation was traumatized by
the horror of war and vowed that war would be a thing of the past.
This film revists the popular hopes and experiences in the years
following World War I--and the looming threat of a new nationalism.
Despite Woodrow Wilson's promise of a "people's peace", defeated
nations were resentful and unreconciled. As fascism and militarism
spread, worldwide pacifist movements fought an increasingly
unsuccessful rearguard action to preserve the dream of peace. 1997.

duels and attacks and counterattacks from trenches just yards

World</b></dt>
<dd>At the end of World War I, President Woodrow Wilson took his
dream of a League of Nations to Paris to seek "peace everlasting,"
joining over 30 international delegations who descended upon the

Big Four (the United States, France, Great Britain and Italy), the
Paris Peace Conference ultimately and ironically sowed the seeds of
resentment that led to World War II. Written and directed by Paul

French soldier as recorded in Kahn's Archive of the Planet. The

Distributed as a propaganda film in the United States and England
to help garner public and international support for the
Republican-coalition forces, the narrator does not mention the word
communism even once during the film, despite much evidence of its
presence. The same narrator only alludes to
"Franco&acirc;&euro;&trade;s unofficial allies"; neither Germany

<dd>Santa Cruz... por ejemplo = Santa Cruz... for example /
director, Gunter Schwaiger -- Presos del silencio = Prisoners of
silence / directors, Mariano Agudo and Eduardo Montero. Part of a
series of documentaries that revisit the Spanish Civil War and
Francoism. Santa Cruz, por ejemplo (Santa Cruz, for example) looks
at facist repression during the first months of the military regime
in the zones where there was no fighting, because from the first
day, the inhabitants were affected by the participants of the coup.
The film opens with consultations of the relatives of assassinated
people, then examines the fear that still lives today in the rural
areas in the wake of Francoism and at how the exhumation of the
disappeared during the Franco regime affects the people and a town.
Presos del silencio (Prisoners of silence) reconstructs the
collective memory of some survivors, who between 1940 and 1962
participated in the construction of the Canal del Bajo
Guadalquivir, what is known today as the Canal of the Prisoners,

<dt><b>The Moroccan Labyrinth (Laberinto Marroqui)</b></dt>

Spanish military attempts to conquer the territory were resisted by
the guerrilla forces of Rif leader Abd el-Krim. The film reveals
how this colonial conflict served as the prologue to the Spanish
Civil War, with losses in the African war undermining the monarchy
and politically emboldening the "African militarists," including
generals such as Francisco Franco, who in 1936 launched a revolt
against the Spanish Republic. Ironically, in order to escape famine
and poverty, thousands of Moroccans enlisted in the Spanish
Falangist movement and found themselves fighting for their former
enemies in Spain against Republican forces. Directed by Julio

<dd>Film summarizing events in the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939),
aimed at American audiences. The film appears to use mainly silent
newsreel and other footage, with music and obviously foleyed sound
effects added. While the film is mainly from the Loyalists stand
point, there is also a bit curious pacificistic slant to it,
keeping with the mood of the US at the time. However, if that is
case, why was the film put together in the first place? Without the
first reel to put the whole thing in context, it is hard to say.

during World War II at the facility. The second half, using almost
the exact same footage, describes Unit 731 from the Japanese
revisionist perspective which is largely supported by the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party in Japan. Although its cruel experiments
on living people produced thousands of casualties, this activity is
still denied by a number of Japanese historians and politicians. A
film by James T. Hong. 2007. <b>DVD X351</b>

Rather than offering a contemporary interpretation of history, the

<dt><b>The Fall of Berlin</b></dt>
<dd>Uses firsthand footage to track the events that led to the
conclusion of the war in Europe and the fall of Berlin on May 2,
1945. As the Americans create a bridgehead on the River Elbe, the
Luftwaffe makes a last desperate attempt to counter the fury of the
Allies bombing of Berlin. While Hitler visits the Eastern Front,
the Hitler Youth builds barricades around the doomed city. But all
is lost, as far as the Third Reich is concerned. The Russian Army
launches an attack along the Oder River, only 40 miles from Berlin.
The German surrender becomes inevitable, and the city is divided up
among the victors. Directed by Yuri Raizman and Elizaveta Svilova.

<dd>John Ford's uncensored version of "December 7th" was banned by
the U.S. Government for nearly fifty years. This is the fully
restored, 84-minute version, with subtitles added to the
controversial Japanese language sequences and a special "behind the
scene" introduction. (A completely censored 34-minute version of
the film was released and earned John Ford his fourth Academy

and is set in Honolulu on the day before the Japanese attack. Uncle
Sam vacations complacently in Hawaii, concerned with the on-going
war in Europe. On Sunday morning, December 7th, air squadrons
appear, "swooping down like flights of tiny locust". The attack on
Pearl Harbor, America's first battle of World War II, is vividly

<dd>Millions of Americans fought for the liberation of Europe from

film intended for the American occupation troops in Japan after the

leaders in this post-war GI indoctrination short. "Unlike its
counterpart, Your Job in Germany, Our Job in Japan was probably
never seen by either military or civilian audiences. By the time it
was readied for release in March 1946, "peace" with Japan was a
reality. Thus the approach to the Japanese is more magnanimous:
they are portrayed as victims of cynical leaders who filled their
minds with thoughts of world conquest. According to the film's
director, Theodore Geisel, Our Job in Japan displeased General
MacArthur and all prints of the film quickly disappeared."

<dt><b>Hitler, A Career</b></dt>
<dd>How did a provincial rabble-rouser from Austria rise to become
Germany's messianic Fuhrer? Why did Germans from all walks of life
embrace the fascist Nazi philosophy and willingly follow Hitler
into a titanic conflict and utter destruction? This meticulously
assembled film dissects the Third Reich with a keen analytical
blade, charting Hitler's improbable rise, his mastery of imagery
and crowd psychology, and his consummate skill in exploiting the
weaknesses in others. Examining the public and private dynamics of
Nazism's unhinged dictatorship by making use of an amazing array of
never-before-seen film footage from secret archives and private
collections, the film uncovers the deeper causes behind the rise
and fall of Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich. A film by Joachim C.

fought in World War II, their contribution is virtually unknown to
the American public. This documentary is the first to tell their
stories, which have been "missing in action" for far too long. Four

These veterans served in the Air Force, the Army and the Marines
and fought in three different theaters of World War II: Europe, the

Andrew was in the Philippines. In the chaos of combat, they stole
valuable treasures and hid them overseas before returning to
civilian life in America. Sixty years later back in America, both
men have gone blind with little hope of ever recovering their
goods. Both want to recover the treasures that they feel are their
own, but with their health failing, they need Lance's help to
travel halfway around the world to find them. So with time,
distance and the odds against them, Lance throws himself into their
dubious quests to unearth the past, laying bare family secrets and

<dt><b>The 1940s House</b></dt>
<dd>One modern family takes on the challenge of domestic life on
Britain's home front in 1940s house, a re-creation of a World War
II household. This time-travel experiment covers the period from
the outbreak of war in 1939 to Victory Day in 1945, compressing the
events of six wartime years into two months. Though the military
threat is metaphorical, the privations are real and the pressures
create tensions nonexistent in modern society. 2004. ca. 3 hrs.

l'oubli)</b></dt>
<dd>Although the Nanjing Massacre, a series a war crimes committed
by Japanese troops in China's capital during the second
Sino-Japanese War, occurred seventy years ago, the nature and
extent of these atrocities remains the subject of continuing debate
and the source of political tensions between China and Japan. This
film uses archival footage and photos, interviews with Chinese
survivors and eyewitnesses, former Japanese soldiers, and both
Chinese and Japanese government officials, historians and lawyers,
to document the events ... and to show how the interpretation of
this history has become politicized. A Film by Micha&euml;l Prazan.

<dt><b>Nanjing Nightmares</b></dt>
<dd>The Japanese subjugation of the capital of China in 1937-38 has
been called "The Rape of Nanjing" or the "Nanjing Atrocity." It is
considered one of the most brutal, sadistic acts of war in modern

generations of Chinese. This documentary recounts the historical
events leading up to the terrifying occupation: the growth of
China's capital city, Nanjing; the expansionist ambitions
resistance by the Chinese army in the defense of Shanghai. Archival
film footage depicts the full horror of the genocide in Nanjing, in
which some 300,000 people were killed and 80,000 women were raped,
in a one month period. Director, Guo Fangfang 2000. 45 min.

this Navy film which purports to educate its audience about the

into the shortcomings of said aspects, it results in a recitation
of a wide range of racial stereotypes, ethnic misrepresentations
and hatred. <b>Negro soldier</b>: The great film director Frank
Capra's much acclaimed and respected recruitment film tailored to
convince African Americans of the value the nation put upon their
military service in the past and of the need the nation had of

(1944, 10 min.) <b>Giant killers</b>: The subject of this film is
Elco, the Bayonne, New Jersey firm who made nearly 400 PT Boats

force. This films sails through the manufacture of these fine
machines, proudly showing off the plant and gratefully celebrating
its workers. <b>Inside fighting China</b>: Many history books
continue to wrongly insist that it was the long-suffering Soviet
Union who suffered the most amount of casualties during World War
II. The fact is, China suffered far, far more in casualties, and
fought for a far, far longer period of time on at least the same
savage scale. This film intended to tell these facts as they had so
far developed to a 1942 audience in order to get them to understand
China's importance and contribution to the overall war effort.
<b>Target: Japan</b>: A March Of Time production illustrating the
extraordinary leaps of military strength that the United States
made from its low point after the Pearl Harbor attack to
overpowering stamina and strength displayed in the Marshall

homeland. <b>Fleet that came to stay</b>: A landmark film produced

to contemplate the impact of these events on our attitudes toward
people with disabilities in our own era. A film by Sharon Snyder

North Korea invaded South Korea on June 25, 1950, a disastrously
downsized, Post-WWII American military acted swiftly to stop this
first instance of armed Communist aggression but the U.N.
contingent soon found itself thrown back into disarray. Bottled up
with their backs to the sea at Pusan, America and her allies now
faced a humiliating evacuation. <b>Video/C 6636</b></dd>

forces on the verge of being pushed into the sea at Pusan, victory
was within the grasp of the surrounding North Korean army, but
General Douglas MacArthur executed a high-risk amphibious landing
at Inchon. Within months, MacArthur's men would drive the North
Koreans almost to the Chinese border. But their victory would turn
to devastating defeat, as a huge wave of Chinese troops took the
U.N. contingent by surprise, forcing a retreat back into South
Korea. <b>Video/C 6637</b></dd>

by the hordes of Chinese troops pouring across the Yalu River,
American forces experienced defeats at the Chosin Reservoir and the
evacuation of forces from the port of Hungnam. By December of 1950,
the communists had recaptured the North Korean capital, Pynongyang;
a month later, the southern capital of Seoul also fell. Now, with
the war becoming increasingly costly for both sides, the two
adversaries dug in and consolidated their forces at the 38th
Parallel. <b>Video/C 6638</b></dd>

casualties mounted, U.S. President Harry Truman came under
increasing military and political pressure finally resulting in
MacArthur's dismissal and the arrival of General Matthew Ridgway.
After retaking Seoul the U.N. forces confronted the re-grouped
enemy in the biggest battle of the war. But by now, U.S. policy had
shifted from liberation to containing the communists at the 38th

<dd>On August 6th, 1945 a weapon unlike any other was unleashed on
the Japanese city of Hiroshima. Four days later, the Japanese
surrendered, having been subjected to horrors and devastation

<dt><b>Atomic Mom</b></dt>
<dd>A film about two women, both mothers, who have very different
experiences of the atom bomb. One is the filmmaker's mother,
Pauline Silvia, who was a biologist in the Navy in the early 1950s
and was sent to the Nevada Test Site where she participated in five
detonations. After decades of silence, Pauline is in a crisis of
conscience about the work she did ... She reveals some of the grim
and dark secrets of the U.S. atomic testing program. In an attempt
to reconcile with her own mother's past, her daughter, filmmaker
M.T. Silvia, meets Emiko Okada, a Hiroshima survivor trying to
resolve her own history in Japan. She was eight years old when the
bomb was dropped and her twelve-year-old sister was never found.
After many years of silence, Ms. Okada gives testimony of her
atomic bomb experience and her commitment to education and
disarmament. The film follows these survivors, each on a different
end of atomic warfare, as they attempt to understand the other.

British and French sectors form a Western enclave in the Soviet
zone of divided Germany. In June 1948, the Soviets blockade the
city, but the Western allies successfully airlift in supplies. In

conceivable with Stalin's death. Khrushchev outmaneuvers Malenkov
for power and visits the West. Germans, Poles and Hungarians
attempt to rise against Soviet rule. In 1956, an uprising in
Hungary is ruthlessly crushed by Soviet tanks. The United States,

Soviet Union seems to be forging ahead. In October 1957, the first
Soviet satellite Sputnik orbits the earth--to the dismay and fear
of the United States, frustrated by its own ineffectual space
program. In 1961, the Soviets launch Yuri Gargarin into space.

superpowers use surrogates to wage ideological and often physical
conflict. In 1967 and 1973, American backed-Israel triumphs over
Soviet-backed Egypt and Syria. In Africa, the Soviets exploit
nationalist, anti-colonial struggles. The U.S. supports South
Africa in its battle against communism. <b>Video/C 5740</b></dd>

regarded Latin America as its own backyard. Fearing the spread of
communism, it seeks to destabilize leftist governments. In 1973,
the CIA helps overthrow the Chilean President Salvador Allende; in
the 1980s, it supports right-wing extremists in Nicaragua and El
Salvador. <b>Video/C 5740</b></dd>

a war that costs the lives of almost 15,000 Soviet conscripts and
an estimated one million Afghans. The U.S. supplies billions of

penetrate the Iron Curtain are thwarted. The U.S. reacts with
increasingly sophisticated technological intelligence--the U-2
spy-plane, satellite reconnaissance and electronic eavesdropping.
Yet human spies remain important. Sometimes betrayers, sometimes
betrayed, many spies pay with their lives. <b>Video/C 5741</b></dd>

<dd>Riots and protests intensified in the U.S. as the war in
Vietnam dragged on, with anti-war and civil rights activists
seeking violent ways to agitate for peace and equality. This
program presents the unrelenting rage that divided the nation
during those perilous years, as the Watts race riots, the
assissinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy, and the
Kent State killings made headline news. c1999. 45 min. <b>Video/C

<dt><b>Do you Remember Vietnam?</b></dt>
<dd>In 1978, three years after the fall of Saigon, John Pilger went
back to Vietnam to find out what had happened under the new regime.
He talks with a young tour guide at a war crimes museum, who had
been imprisoned in the infamous US tiger cages. He follows a former
North Vietnamese soldier into the underground base where he spent
20 years crawling through tunnels undetected. He visits the street
in Hanoi that was the target of the largest single aerial
bombardment in history. And he shows us the re-education camps
where former drug addicts, prostitutes, South Vietnam soldiers, and
others are being taught what to think. Originally released in 1978

<dt><b>Little Dieter Needs to Fly</b></dt>
<dd>A film by Werner Herzog with Dieter Dengler. Growing up in
post-WWII Germany, all Dieter Dengler, the son of a Nazi slain
during the war, dreamed about was becoming a pilot. At age 18 he
emigrated to the United States and worked odd jobs until he was
accepted into the Navy and began pilot training. He was sent to
Vietnam around 1966 and on his first mission was shot down and
taken prisoner. There, the Vietcong tortured him until Dengler
engineered a hair-raising escape and eventually returned to the
U.S. His story is recounted here via interviews with Dengler,
archival footage and new footage seamlessly spliced together. 2000.

<dt><b>The Long-haired Warriors</b></dt>
<dd>Vietnamese women have a long and legendary tradition of fierce
warriorship -- a tradition exemplified in recent history by their
wholehearted participation in the struggles against the French, the
South Vietnamese Regular Army, and the American military.
Ultimately, they shared in all those victories, but none came
without painful losses and sorrows. This provocative documentary
introduces a number of Vietnamese women who were active in the
National Liberation Front, or Viet Cong, and shows how their
wartime experiences shaped the rest of their lives. A highlight of
the film is an emotional visit with four former prisoners to the
infamous Con Dao prison camp where, from 1968 to 1975, they were
among 600 women -- some as young as 15 years old -- kept in "tiger
cages" and subjected to frequent torture and abuse by the
American-supported South Vietnamese military forces. From disparate
perspectives, these women universally express the conviction that
their stories can provide a common thread of compassion to bind the
wounds that divide people in the U.S. and Vietnam. They feel a bond
with American wives and mothers who have also suffered profound
losses. This engaging film examines the lives of some of America's
former enemies and illuminates some surprising parallels and
contrasts between their world and the world of the American
filmmaker who seeks to discover their stories. It will stimulate
discussion in a variety of courses in women's studies, Asian
studies, and history. Produced by Mel Halbach. 1998. 60 min.

<dt><b>The Mills of the Gods: Viet Nam.</b></dt>
<dd>"As direct cinema evolved, so did its commitment to supporting
social change. The Canadian Broadcasting Company did much to
encourage and extend direct cinema's impact by creating television
series devoted to direct cinema films engaging social issues. The
most influential among these was the program "This Hour Has Seven
Days." The Mills of the Gods, a shocking look at the early stages
of the Vietnam War, was the show's most controversial and
influential production. Beryl Fox, who had already established
herself as a prolific filmmaker committed tosocial change in films
such as Summer in Mississippi (1965) about American race relations,
takes her camera to the Vietnam War to record the conflict and
allows viewers to witness, first-hand, the sorrow, futility, and
inhumanity at itscore. The film reveals the horrors of the war: the
wide-scale destruction, thebrutal civilian casualties, and the
torture of prisoners of war. These scenes are contrasted with quiet
shots of everyday life in Vietnamese villages, and with candid
interviews with enthusiastic American soldiers and pilots, who
allseem to love their work. The films most shocking sequences come
from filming with an American pilot on a bombing raid. The pilot is
overjoyed at his successful napalm drop. Fox then takes her camera
down to the village that was bombed, and shows us the horrific
carnage the joyful pilot had caused. The Millsof the Gods caused
both an immediate sensation and outrage when it was broadcast. The
BBC aired the program, and the film circulated widely in the US,
mainly on college campuses. The CBC had to run disclaimers before
the film thatit did not present the viewpoint of the broadcaster.
The US was so outraged that it basically blacklisted the CBC from
any important news event in Washington, DC. The film caused
diplomatic tensions to rise between Canada and the US, and led the
Canadian government to pressure the CBC, which cancelled "This Hour
Has Seven Days" in 1966. The Mills of the Gods is a perfect example
of direct cinema's ability to go deeply into divisive issues and of
the reaction of the establishment to its unconventional style of
reporting events. Fox made two more acclaimed films about Vietnam
(Saigon, 1967; Last Reflections on a War, 1968).The Mills of the
Gods stands as one of the most important films on that tragic
conflict." [from <a href=

<dt><b>The Quiet Mutiny</b></dt>
<dd>In this, the first of his documentary films, John Pilger
combines candid interviews and amazing frontline footage of Vietnam
to portray a growing rift between the US military bureaucrats --
"lifers" -- and the soldiers who physically and mentally fight the
war on the ground, the "grunts." By 1970, it is an internal sense
of disillusionment and frustration born from this rift that is
triggering the withdrawal of US forces from Vietnam. Pilger finds
himself unable to glean significant information from the military
and so it is with the grunts, that he finds a very human side to
the US presence in Vietnam -- soldiers who are at once ready to
serve their country and doubtful of their purpose there. They
experience the war in a way many of their superiors do not. Filmed
at Camp Snuffy in 1970, this film presents a character study of the
common soldier during the Vietnam War, revealing for the first time
the shifting morale and open rebellion of Western troops. Produced
by Jeremy Wallington; reported by John Pilger ; directed by Charles
Denton. Originally released in 1970 by Granada International

propaganda films intended to be shown to their own forces.

<dt><b>Year Zero: The Silent Death of Cambodia</b></dt>
<dd>The first complete report of the atrocities committed by the
Khmer Rouge and the devastating affects of US bombing in Cambodia
during the Vietnam War. Year Zero was 1975, the end of the secret
US bombing campaign against the Viet Cong that saw 100,000 tons of
bombs dropped over Cambodia, and the emergence of the Khmer Rouge
party as a ruling force. That year saw the desertion of the capital
of Phnom Penh and the displacement of some 2.5 million people, the
majority of whom would soon go missing. Pilger explores the roots
of the US bombing campaign that began in 1969, contrasting it
sharply with powerful footage of sick and starving Cambodians and
interviews with relief workers with UNICEF and the Red Cross as
well as imprisoned members of Pol Pot's regime. Produced and
directed by David Munro; reported by John Pilger; edited by
Jonathan Morris. 52 min. <b>DVD 8405</b>

<dt><b>Winter Soldier</b></dt>
<dd>Vietnam veterans speak about atrocities committed upon
Vietnamese soldiers and civilians during their time in the U.S.
armed forces in Vietnam. Through testimony given at the Winter
Soldier Investigation held by the Vietnam Veterans Against the War
in 1971, press conferences, and interviews with individual
participants, the film graphically portrays the effect of U.S.
government policy and practice, which turned soldiers into animals
bent on destruction and Vietnamese into "gooks"--Non-human
"targets" for murder, rape, and mutilation. The veterans struggle
to come to terms with the devastation they caused so that others
will not make the same mistake again. The Winter Soldier
Investigation was held in Detroit, Michigan on January 31, February
1 and 2, 1971. Originally released in 1972. 95 min. <b>DVD 4949</b>

massacres among the Islamic guerillas, the military and civilians.
Algeria's first democratic election since independence went to the
Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), but when they initiated Islamic
reforms, protests erupted. With the FIS positioned to win the 1991
elections, the military circumvented the democratic process and
cancelled the vote, which brought about a massive revolt with many
sent to prison camps that became breeding grounds for terrorism. A

Times.</b></dt>
<dd>Intro: Where were you? -- A simple story -- Playing at war --
Constructing the enemy. "Full of poignant footage and moving
responses from children, exposes how the media has been used to
earn public support for the U.S.-led military campaign against
Iraq. The news coverage, as well as movies, television shows and
video games that have incorporated the narrative of war into their
storylines, has an especially profound influence on children, who
often bring both entertainment and real-world violence to their
play. This video examines how the "good and evil" rhetoric, in both
the entertainment and the news media, has helped children to
dehumanize the enemies, justify their killing and treat the
suffering of innocent civilians as necessary sacrifice." c2003. 37

<dt><b>Bad Voodoo's War</b></dt>
<dd>In June 2007, as the American military surge reached its peak,
a band of National Guard infantrymen who call themselves 'The Bad
Voodoo Platoon' was deployed to Iraq. To record their war, from
private reflections to real-time footage of improvised explosive
device (IED) attacks on the ground, FRONTLINE creates a 'virtual
embed', supplying cameras to the soldiers and working with them to
shape an intimate portrait that reveals the hard grind of their
war. The film intimately tracks the veteran soldiers of 'Bad
Voodoo' through the daily realities of their perilous mission,
grappling with the political complexities of dealing with Iraqi
security forces, and battling their fatigue and their fears.
Written, produced and directed by Deborah Scranton. First aired as
an episode of the television program Frontline on April 1, 2008. 56

<dt><b>The Blood of My Brother</b></dt>
<dd>Takes the viewer behind the scenes of one Iraqi family's
struggle to survive amidst the carnage of the growing Shia
insurgency. Nineteen-year-old Ibrahim struggles to provide for his
family when his older brother is shot and killed by an American
patrol. With scenes of fighting and death on the streets of
Baghdad, this documentary is the closest most viewers will ever
come to being in Iraq; kneeling in prayer amidst a thousand Muslim
worshippers, feeling the roar of low-flying Apaches, riding atop a
sixty-ton tank, driving with masked resistance fighters to attack
American positions, fleeing the threat of an overwhelming response,
the blood in the street, a tank on fire, or the cold, distant stare
of a dead Iraqi fighter. Director, Andrew Berends. 2005. 81 min.

unflinching view of the physical and emotional aftermath of war.
This documentary unfolds on two parallel tracks. On the one hand,
we see Tomas evolving into a powerful voice against the war as he
struggles to deal with the complexities of a paralyzed body. And on
the other hand, we see the historic debate unfolding in the
Congress in 2002 about going to war in Iraq. Directed by Ellen
Spiro and Phil Donahue. c2008. 87 min. <b>DVD X3832</b>

<dt><b>For Life Against the War ... Again</b></dt>
<dd>In 1967, with the Vietnam War escalating wildly, an invitation
was issued to filmmakers to create works running under three
minutes in protest against the accumulating carnage. The original
organizers chose the rubric For Life, Against the War, and
eventually compiled sixty films. Now, decades later, an invitation
to protest yet another war seemed sadly urgent, inspiring the New
York Film-Makers Cooperative to ring the clarion once "...Again."
The response was overwhelming, with submissions from several
generations of artists unified by a singular disgust for the war in
Iraq and the foreign policy that perpetuates it. Compiled with
works from the overtly angry to the formally forceful, For Life,
Against the War boldly announces that artists can take a stand,
again and again. Contents: The scream : 21st century edition / Jim

<dt><b>Full Battle Rattle</b></dt>
<dd>Before American soldiers are deployed to Iraq, they're given
three weeks special training at the National Training Center on the
Ft. Irwin Military Reservation, located in California's Mojave
Desert. The National Training Center has constructed a simulated
Iraqi village called Medina Wasl in the desert (one of thirteen
such 'villages'), where new soldiers battle 'insurgents' (played by
returning U.S. troops) and interact with 'ordinary citizens' (many
portrayed by Iraqi exiles who've ended up in the United States) as
they learn the ins and outs of combat in the Middle East. Full
Battle Rattle offers a behind-the-scenes- look at Medina Wasl, the
soldiers who learn there, the people who organize the war games,
and the people who've been hired to play-act at being 'the enemy'.

<dt><b>The Ground Truth</b></dt>
<dd>Documents the stories of patriotic young Americans - ordinary
men and women who heeded the call for military service in Iraq and
Afghanistan - as they experience recruitment and training, combat,
homecoming, and the struggle to reintegrate with families and

honesty in the film, are a prelude for the even more challenging
battles fought by the soldiers returning home - with personal
demons, an uncomprehending public, and an indifferent government.
As these battles take shape, each soldier becomes a new kind of
hero, bearing witness and giving support to other veterans, and
learning to fearlessly wield the most powerful weapon of all - the
truth. Produced and directed by Patricia Foulkrod. Originally
released as a documentary film in 2006; expanded from the

forces in the nation's capitol believe Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein is to blame, for this and many other terrorist acts during
the last decade. Many are lobbying to mobilize a military operation

<dd>Using an array of montage and interviews, this film traces a
series of protests against American foreign policy from October
2002 through February 2003 to create a vision of resistance in
solidarity in the months prior to the 2003 War on Iraq. Directed
and written by Nashid Fareed. (For other videos in this series, See

<dt><b>Home Front</b></dt>
<dd>To date, nearly 20,000 American troops have been wounded in the
war in Iraq. This film gives a face and a voice to these
underrepresented soldiers and their families, told intimately
through the Feldbusch family of Pennsylvania and their wounded son
Jeremy. The result is an insightful view of how Jeremy and other
"wounded warriors" of the Iraq War are reconstructing their lives,
with courage and determination to face a new, altered self. Home
Front gets behind the often-sanitized myth of war to reveal its
true complications and costs. Directed, produced, written and
edited by Richard Hankin. Dist. <a href=

<dt><b>Imperial Grand Strategy: The Conquest of Iraq and the
Assault on Democracy.</b></dt>
<dd><b>Imperial Grand Strategy</b>: "Chomsky takes on the war in
Iraq cutting through the ideological fog that surrounds the
invasion and occupation, laying waste to the U.S. government's
justifications for them. In the process, he uncovers the real
motivations behind U.S. military aggression: a global imperial plan
put in place long before Iraq --and that will extend far into the
future, unless we do something about it." <b>The Assault on Freedom
and Democracy</b>: Chomsky "moves from broad, geo-political
concerns to the sort of authoritarian societies needed "on the
ground" for such imperial strategies to work. Discussing the
Patriot Acts (1 &amp; 2) at home and a long and disgraceful U.S.
history of "democracy-building" abroad, Chomsky highlights the vast
difference between noble rhetoric and our consistent military and
economic support for dictators and thugs." Questions About
Anarchism: Comsky is interviewed by Barry Pateman of the Emma
Goldman Papers. "In a more relaxed and personal exchange, Chomsky
discusses the anarchist principles that have guided him since he
was a teenager and that lie behind the social and political
analysis he's been producing for the last four decades." Imperial
grand strategy was recorded May 22, 2004 ; The assault on freedom
and democracy was recorded December 3, 2003 ; Questions about
anarchism was recorded February 17, 2004. 220 min. <b>DVD

<dt><b>Outside the Wire</b></dt>
<dd>A documentary trilogy by independent filmmaker J.D. Johannes.
"Go outside the wire" ...as he tells the complex story of the war
in Iraq. The interviews with Soldiers and Marines were conducted at
the combat outposts where they lived and worked. <b>'Danger
Close'</b> is an up-close, in-depth look at a complex attack by Al
Qaida on a small, distant U.S. Army outpost on the edge of the
Euphrates river valley. J.D. Johannes was the only reporter to
witness the attack and followed the US Army paratroopers into
combat --nearly getting himself killed. <b>'Anbar Awkens'</b> shows
the greatest turn-around of the Iraq War --the tribes of Al Anbar
province joining with the coalition to fight Al Qaida --from the
perspective of the Jumayli tribe. The Jumayli tribe --with no
prompting from the Coalition --turned on Al Qaida and engaged in a
serious gun-battle with Al Qaida before formally joining with the
coalition. <b>'Baghdad Surge'</b> is a look at the surge from
asphalt level. This episode follows a U.S. Army infantry Captain
through a 'day-of-the-surge' and the modern three-block-war.
Written &amp; narrated by J.D. Johannes ; shot &amp; directed by
J.D. Johannes. 2008. 110 min. <b>DVD 9473</b></dd>
<dt><b>Playing the News.</b></dt>
<dd>In 2004, television, radio and print media covered the U.S.-led
attack on Fallujah. So did one video game. But can video games do
journalism? This documentary examines the role played by New York
based reality games company Kuma Reality Games in connecting young
people to current events. After designing a video game called
Kuma/War based on the November 2004 siege of Fallujah, Kuma Reality
began to think of itself as a news organization. But war reporting
has certainly never looked like this before. A film by Jigar Mehta
and Jeff Plunkett. 2005. 20 min. <b>DVD 6108</b></dd>
<dt><b>Rumsfeld's War</b></dt>
<dd>With the United States Army deployed in a dozen hotspots around
the world, on constant alert in Afghanistan, and taking casualties
every day in Iraq, some current and former officers now say the
army is on the verge of being "broken." They charge that the army
is overstretched, demoralized and may be unable to fight where and
when the nation desires. This program digs into the aggressive
attempts to assert civilian control and remake the military by the
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and his allies. Produced and
directed by Michael Kirk. Originally broadcast on the PBS program
Frontline, 2004. 90 min. <b>DVD 3620</b></dd>

faces Congressional hearings concerning issues of abuse of Iraqi
prisoners by U.S. Military personnel in the Abu Ghraib Prison.
There are lots of serious questions. Why hasn't Rumsfeld thoroughly
read the report on the abuses at that prison in Iraq? Why is the
investigation moving so slowly? Why didn't he inform the President,
or Congress, before the now infamous pictures showed up on
television to inflame the American public and damage relations with
Iraq? Originally produced for the television program Primetime

notorious U.S.-run detainment center. One of the most dramatic
moments in recent U.S. military history is examined through
interviews with participants and dramatic reenactments. Produced
