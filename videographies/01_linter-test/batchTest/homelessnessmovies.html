<dt><b>Heroes for Sale</b> (1933)</dt>
<dd>Directed by William A. Wellman. Cast: Richard Barthelmess,
Aline MacMahon, Loretta Young, Gordon Westcott, Robert Barrat.
"What isn't Heroes for Sale about? Within its 71-minute time frame,
this film (co-written by "professional cynic" Wilson Mizner)
tackles such issues as disenfranchised war veterans, misguided hero
worship, drug addiction, the Depression, capitalism, labor
relations and communism. Richard Barthelmess plays a wounded war
hero whose hospital stay has turned him into a morphine junkie. He
wanders from town to town looking for work during the Depression,
only to be turned away with a "we've got our own to watch out for!"
Eventually, Barthelmess befriends millionaire-in-the-making Robert
H. Barrat, who has invented a revolutionary washing machine.
Becoming Barrat's partner, Barthelmess attempts to quell a strike
by workers who've been stirred up by Red agitators. With all this
going on, Barthelmess still finds time to romance Loretta Young.
Heroes for Sale is very much a product of its time, though its
entertainment value has remained solid for well over six decades."

<dt><b>Hobo Gadget Band</b> (1939)</dt>
<dd>Animated short. Directed by Cal Dalton and Ben Hardaway. At the
hobo hotel, it's morning. One hobo awakens, and carefully avoids
the shower, except for a drop on each eye. He stops at the medicine
cabinet for some "soda fizz" which jets about, causing havoc. A
train goes by, and the swinging rhythm inspires a makeshift
clarinet solo. The cook grabs some fish from the fridge, which
opens right onto the river. Another train whistle prompts an
announcer; the hobos board down a slide. The clarinet player starts
up again, and everyone dances. The engineer notices, stops the
train, and pulls the "hobo eliminator" lever, which ejects them.
Fortunately, they land right in front of a sign looking for amateur
musicians at a radio station. They play and sing, to everyone's
enjoyment. The station owner offers them luxury but a passing train
whistle changes their minds. <b>DVD 8516</b></dd>

instead spends a hard winter looking after a dying derelict. Vito
Russo has commented: When buddy films returned in the late Sixties,
the presence onscreen of homosexual characters was a perfect way of
saying, 'Oh, no, /this isn't what we mean at all.' Homosexuals drew
suspicion away from the buddies--it was yardstick time again."
