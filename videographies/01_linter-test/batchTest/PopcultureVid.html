directed, and produced by Leslie Zemeckis. Bonus features: Three

<dt><b>Ethnic Notions.</b></dt>
<dd>Written and directed by Marlon Riggs. Covering more than one
hundred years of United States history, traces the evolution of
Black American caricatures and stereotypes that have fueled
anti-Black prejudice. Loyal Toms, carefree Sambos, faithful
Mammies, grinning Coons, savage Brutes and wide-eyed Pickaninnies
roll across the screen in cartoons, feature films, popular songs,
advertisements, household artifacts, even children's rhymes. These
caricatures permeated popular culture from the 1820s to the Civil
Rights era and implanted themselves within the American psyche.

<dt><b>Great Escape, 1927.</b> (<i>The People's Century</i>)</dt>
<dd>By the mid-1920s, millions worldwide were already confirmed
"moviegoers". Movies reflected and affected the way people dressed,
thought and spoke, teaching the inexperienced about love and
courage, while the governments around the globe were quick to
realize the power of film: this new mass entertainment would also
prove an unrivaled tool of mass persuasion. Here moviegoers
reminisce, revealing how the new medium persuaded, influenced and
entralled them, as it offered a welcome refuge from the century's
pressures. c1998. 56 min. <b>DVD X5254 [preservation copy]; Video/C

archetypal suburban experience: shopping at the mall. Visiting
"cathedrals of consumerism" throughout North America -- from the
Southdale, Minnesota, progenitor of the enclosed retail mall to the

Vegas -- the video raises fundamental questions about consumer
identity and diversity. Evoking "experience retail" as a conceptual
counterpoint to Internet-driven home shopping, the program also

elaborate decision-making process about whether or not to get a
tatoo as a jumping off point for a larger discussion of youth,

The 19th century was a period of growth both for alcoholic
beverages and the temperance movement. The women's crusade of 1873
was essentially a general strike by women whose protest spread to
911 communities in 37 territories. However no laws had been changed
and within a few years, saloons were back in business. In 1879,
Frances E. Willard became the head of the Woman's Christian
Temperance Union. Carrie Nation and her home defenders army started
closing saloons in Kansas but it too failed to change laws. By the
turn of the 20th century, there were some 300,000 saloons in
America. Saloons were not only social centers but places where you
could look for jobs or learn to speak English. The Anti-Saloon
league was the most successful pressure group in America and the
most effective in making alcohol a wedge issue. The brewers fought
back but the temperance movement continued to grow, leading to the
passing of the 19th Amendment. 94 min.</dd>

With the passing of the 19th Amendment to the US Constitution, the
federal government now passes legislation to enforce it. Known as
the Volstead Act, the legislation forbids not only hard liquor but
also beer and light wine which many legislators assumed would be
exempted. Penalties as well were far harsher than many had
expected. The ban on alcoholic beverages could not be complete as
alcohol was required by many industrial processes, religious
observances and for medicinal purposes. From the day the ban went
into into effect,entrepreneurs found ways, some legal, most not -
to get around the law. Rum running. became big business with
schooners plying their trade on both the Pacific and Atlantic sides
of the U.S. By the mid-1920s many people had come to the conclusion
that prohibition was a mistake. Those who drank were drinking more
and with no way for government to regulate the illegal industry,
they were also drinking bad liquor. Criminal gangs sprang up across
the country but Chicago became synonymous with vice and booze. 110

By the mid-1920s, a great many people had become convinced that
prohibition was a serious mistake. Al Smith was adamant that as
President, he would repeal the 18th Amendment. While alcohol
consumption continued to rise, nothing demonstrated the failure of
prohibition as did the rise of organized crime and the man who
became the poster boy for crime and bootlegging, Al Capone. Soon,
Pauline Sabin organized a national movement to restore the legal
sale of alcoholic beverages. By the time Franklin Delano Roosevelt
was elected in 1932, beer was being sold and in less than a year,
the 19th Amendment was repealed. 94 min.</dd>

Feast of the Madonna del Soccoroso (also known as the Fisherman's

<dd>Producer/director/writer, Beth Harrington. After recording an
Italian-American religious festival in Boston's North End with her
camcorder, Beth Harrington's neighbors tell her they see a miracle
on the videotape: a statue of the Virgin Mary blinking its eyes. To
her amazement, and in spite of her lapsed religious beliefs, she
must admit that her life has been transformed by the event. And
when the press gets ahold of the story what ensues is an amusing
look at what it means to believe and to belong. 1997. 57 min.

<dd>The first Mardi Gras in America was celebrated in Mobile,
Alabama in 1703. In 2007, it is still racially segregated.
Filmmaker Margaret Brown, herself a daughter of Mobile, escorts us

diamond-encrusted crowns, voluminous, hand-sewn gowns, surreal
masks and enormous paper mache floats. Against this opulent

power dynamics, elusive forces that keep this hallowed tradition
organized along enduring color lines. Directed by Margaret Brown ;

<dt><b>Cinderella of the Cape Flats</b>(Real stories from a free
South Africa; v. 2)</dt>
<dd>Everyday the working class Coloured women in the garment
industry of the windswept flats around Cape Town toil anonymously
to make clothes so that other women will look beautiful. Invariably
they cannot afford these garments themselves. But for one day a
year they come out in all their glory at the Annual Spring Queen
pageant. The pageant is created by the workers and their trade
union to bring their families together for an evening of solidarity
and fun. Set against the preparation for the 2003 pageant, this
film explores the lives of working women and celebrates them as
creators of beauty. Although the end of apartheid has not taken
away the drudgery of repetitive factory labor, this pageant shows
working class women inventing their own lively folk culture. A film

<dd>Shows the remarkable carnival celebrations of a remote
community of Quechusa Indians high in the Peruvian Andes. The
Q'eros play flutes and sing to their alpacas in a ritual to promote

individual, to family, to ayllu, to community, a structure of
spiritual activity distinct from the structure of kinship. The
Q'eros sing and play separately from each other, producing a
heterophonic sound without rhythmic beat, harmony, or counterpoint
-- a "chaotic" sound texture that exemplifies a key connection
between the culture of the Andes and that of the Amazon jungle.

<dt><b>Bontoc Eulogy</b></dt>
<dd>A personal and poignant docu-drama that examines the Filipino
experience at the 1904 St. Louis World's fair. The film focuses on
the filmmaker's grandfather, an Igorot warrior, one of the 1,100
tribal natives displayed as anthropological 'specimens' in the
Philippine village exhibit. A unique fusion of rare archival
images, verite, and carefully orchestrated visual sequences shot in
the present, the film is an innovative investigation of history,
memory and the spectacle of the "other" in the turn-of-the-century
America. A film by Marlon Fuentes. Dist. <a href=

distinctive uniform of particular periods, taking the concept of
"fashion" to the opposite extreme from its earlier meaning as the

century European romanticism, this film looks back through history
to uncover the beginning of "new vision" thinking in Western
civilization and its links to what is now called counterculture.
From 1830's Paris to New York City's Greenwich Village at the turn
of the 20th century, it follows the paths which brought Europe's
most rebellious voices to America. Includes profiles of William
Blake, Victor Hugo, Theophile Gauthier, Charles Baudelaire, John
Reed and Woody Guthrie. <b>Video/C 7444</b></dd>

War II, a new period of post-war social complexity overtook
America. It was during this turbulent, often repressive Cold War
time that Jack Kerouac coined the phrase, "beat" and gave birth to
a new literary movement. This film follows the activities of this
new breed of writer: Kerouac, Cassady, Ginsburg and a handful of
outsiders who became known as the "Beat Generation." <b>Video/C

twenty-six year old creative writing student named Ken Kesey became
a guinea pig for LSD experiments conducted by the CIA and later
used this experience to write "One flew over the cuckoo's nest."
Timothy Leary, a Harvard research psychologist turned rebel guru,
told people to "Turn on, tune in, drop out!" while an anti-war
activist named Abbie Hoffman led a peace demonstration at the 1968
Chicago democratic convention. This film delves into the world of
hippies and yippies; young people who put themselves at risk in
pursuit of "perception" and democratic freedom. <b>Video/C

anarchist" Londoner Johnny Rotten began a full-blown counterculture
of protest and self-expression; a cry against crushing youth
unemployment and a voice for the disenfranchised. This film
examines a new kind of music, a new social critique and a new form
of free speech. Featured are the bands, the Sex Pistols, The Clash,
and the Damned who turned the rebellious tension of rock and roll
back on itself -- and blew it up. <b>Video/C 7447</b></dd>

and Sea Shepherd Conservation Society scoffed at the mainstream
tactics of institutionalized environmentalism and instead took
direct action to protect Mother Earth. Witness here the story of
grass-roots rebellion with an ecological cause; the story of
radical environmentalists as their 'green rebellion' spread around
the world. <b>Video/C 7448</b></dd>

rebels who inhabit this "New Edge" of the human landscape are
virtual reality experimenters, cyberpunks and underground computer
hackers. This film zooms in on the pioneers of the newly created
counterculture, rebels who question obsolete systems of thought and
just may be at the forefront of a significant new social movement.

<dd>Stigmata is a riveting look at body modification such as
tattooing, cutting, piercing and branding, practices which are

women are transforming their bodies against conventional
stereotypes of femininity rather than to conform to them. Stigmata
explores concepts of beauty, self-determination and the outer
limits of female sexuality. c1992. 27 min. <b>Video/C 4926</b></dd>
