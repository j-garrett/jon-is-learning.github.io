<dt><b> Age of Hope, 1900 (<i>People's Century</i>).  </b><dd> The dawn of the twentieth century was forged in hope and optimism. Here interviewees from Europe, Asia and the United States (boasting an average age of 102), recount the part they played in the century's early history. Whether fighting on the barricades of the failed Russian Revolution of 1905 or campaigning for votes for women; recalling the Paris Exposition of 1900, or President McKinley's assassination or witnessing the sinking of the Titanic, all remember the changes they lived through and the clash of forces  and ideas before World War I. 1998.  56 min.  <B>DVD X5249; vhs Video/C 5555</B><p> 



<p><dt><b>The Cold War.</b>  1998.  47 min. each installment.<p> 

 <dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Comrades, 1917-1945. </b>   Though ideological enemies, the Soviet Union and the United States are allies against Hitler during WWII. At the end of the war, Europe is divided, and the one-time allies now confront each other knowing that the United States has the atomic bomb. <B>Video/C 5735</B> 

<p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Iron Curtain, 1945-1947. </b> The Soviet Union dominates Eastern Europe. Churchill warns of the consequences. Stalin insists that the governments of the Soviet Union's client states be pro-communist. Impoverished after the war, Great Britain opts out as a world power. The United States assumes the mantle of world leadership. <B>Video/C 5735</B>












<p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b> Marshall Plan, 1947-1952. </b> The United States adopts the Truman doctrine, pledging to defend freedom worldwide. Secretary of State George Marshall plans to bolster economic recovery in Europe. Seeing this as a threat, Stalin forbids his satellites to participate. The world effectively divides. <B>Video/C 5735</B>

<p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Berlin, 1948-1949</b>  In Berlin, the American, British and French sectors form a Western enclave in the Soviet zone of divided Germany. In June 1948, the Soviets blockade the city, but the Western allies successfully airlift in supplies. In August 1949, Soviet scientists explode an atomic bomb, establishing nuclear parity between the two  superpowers. <B> Video/C 5736</B>


<p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b> Reds, 1947-1953. </b>  Following Stalin's domination of Eastern Europe and the loss of China, American democracy falls victim to anti-communist hysteria, but survives it. Eisenhower is elected President. In the Soviet Union, Stalin reinforces the climate of terror on which his rule is based. When he dies in 1953, the Soviet people mourn the end of an era. <B>Video/C 5736</B>

<p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Korea, 1949-1953. </b>In June 1950, North Korea invades the South, with Stalin's blessing. The United States, backed by the United Nations, defends South Korea, and then is confronted by communist China. In mid-1951, the war grinds to a bloody stalemate but eventually an armistice is signed. Aggression has been contained. <B>Video/C 5736</B>

<p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b> After Stalin, 1953-1956. </b> Thaw is conceivable with Stalin's death. Khrushchev outmaneuvers Malenkov for power and visits the West. Germans, Poles and Hungarians attempt to rise against Soviet rule. In 1956, an uprising in Hungary is ruthlessly crushed by Soviet tanks. The United States, pledged to contain rather than overthrow communism, does nothing. <B>Video/C 5737</B>





<p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Sputnik, 1949-1961. </b> In the mid-50s, the Soviet Union seems to be forging ahead. In October 1957, the first Soviet satellite Sputnik orbits the earth--to the dismay and fear of the United States, frustrated by its own ineffectual space program. In 1961, the Soviets launch Yuri Gargarin into space. America will have to meet the challenge. <B>Video/C 5737</B>

<p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b> The Wall, 1958-1963. </b> The fate of Germany remains unresolved. West Germany has been admitted to NATO. Within East Germany, Berlin is divided between East and West by an open border. Thousands seize the chance to flee the communist system. To keep their people in, the East Germans, with Soviet backing, build The Wall. <B>Video/C 5737</B>


<p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Cuba, 1959-1962.</b> Khruschev decides, with Castro's agreement, to install short-range and medium-range missiles in Cuba, only 90 miles from the U.S. The United States detects the missile sites and blockades the island. The superpowers confront each other; but rather than embark on nuclear war, they each step back. <B>Video/C 5738</B>

<p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Vietnam, 1954-1968. </b> Vietnam has been divided since the end of French colonial rule. The North is run by communists, the South by anti-communists. Ignoring warnings against involvement in a nationalist struggle, the United States commits its armed forces. American protests against the war mount as the U.S. begins to realize this is not a war it can win. <B>Video/C 5738</B>

<p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b> MAD, 1960-1972. </b> Throughout the 60s, the U.S. and the Soviet Union are locked in a nuclear stand-off; each realizes that bombing the enemy could provoke retaliation and self-destruction. Nuclear strategy evolves into Mutual Assured Destruction, or MAD, in which both sides are guaranteed certain annihilation in the event of nuclear war.  <B>Video/C 5738</B>













<p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b> Make Love Not War, The Sixties.</b> Western economies grow and prosper, fueled partly by armaments production. Rejecting their parents' affluence and the Cold War, many of the young protest and rebel. There is racial violence in U.S. inner cities while rock music comes to express the mood of a disenchanted generation. <B>Video/C 5739</B>

<p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b> Red Spring, The Sixties.</b>In the Soviet bloc, communist rule stifles ambition and achievement. Soviet defense expenditure cripples economic growth. The young lust for totems of America's youth culture--blue jeans and rock-n-roll. In Czechoslovakia, Dubcek attempts limited reform, but in 1968, Soviet force crushes the Prague Spring. <B>Video/C 5739</B>


<p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b> China, 1949-1972. </b> Chinese communists win the longest civil war in 20th century history. Mao's land reforms are popular but in 1958, he embarks on a series of catastrophic changes. China maintains an increasingly uneasy relationship with the Soviet Union. In 1960 the Sino-Soviet split paves the way for President Nixon's historic visit to Beijing. <B>Video/C 5739</B>

<p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b> Detente, 1969-1975.</b>  North Vietnam launches a new offensive against the South. The U.S. steps up its bombing campaign but seeks peace through diplomacy. Nixon and Brezhnev sign the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT). The U.S. finally withdraws from Vietnam. Detente culminates in the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. <B>Video/C 5740</B><p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b> Good Guys, Bad Guys, 1967-1978</b> The superpowers use surrogates to wage ideological and often physical conflict. In 1967 and 1973, American backed-Israel triumphs over Soviet-backed Egypt and Syria. In Africa, the Soviets exploit nationalist, anti-colonial struggles. The U.S. supports South Africa in its battle against communism.<B>  Video/C 5740</B>



<p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>  Backyard, 1954-1990. </b>The U.S. has always regarded Latin America as its own backyard. Fearing the spread of communism, it seeks to destabilize leftist governments. In 1973, the CIA helps overthrow the Chilean President Salvador Allende; in the 1980s, it supports right-wing extremists in Nicaragua and El Salvador.  <B>Video/C 5740</B>

<p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b> Freeze, 1977-1981.</b>  Concern for human rights in the East grows; detente ebbs. The Soviets arm Eastern Europe. The U.S. threatens to site missiles in Western Europe. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan ends detente. Promising tougher measures against Moscow, Reagan defeats Carter for the presidency. In Poland, martial law is imposed.  <B>Video/C 5741</B>


<p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b> Soldiers of God, 1975-1988.</b> Afghanistan is a war that costs the lives of almost 15,000 Soviet conscripts and an estimated one million Afghans. The U.S. supplies billions of dollars of weapons to unlikely allies--Islamic fundamentalists. The result is a Vietnam-style conflict which takes its toll on the Soviets and hastens the end of the Cold War. <B>Video/C 5741</B>

<p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b> Spies, 1944-1994. </b> Early CIA attempts to penetrate the Iron Curtain are thwarted. The U.S. reacts with increasingly sophisticated technological intelligence--the U-2 spy-plane, satellite reconnaissance and electronic eavesdropping. Yet human spies remain important. Sometimes betrayers, sometimes betrayed, many spies pay with their lives. <B>Video/C 5741</B>

<p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b> Star Wars, 1980-1988.</b> Reagan boosts U.S. defense spending and proposes the Strategic Defense Initiative, an anti-missile system in space. New premier Gorbachev knows the Soviets can't match the U.S., and wants to liberalize and reconstruct the Russian economy. After summits in Geneva, Reykjavik and Washington, the leaders agree to drastic arms cuts. <B>Video/C 5742</B>



<p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b> The Wall Comes Down, 1989.</b> Incredibly quickly, the Soviet bloc is breaking up, virtually without bloodshed. First Poland, then Hungary, then East Germany slip away from communist control. Gorbachev makes no effort to hold them back with force. Amid scenes of jubilation, the hated Berlin Wall comes down. <B>Video/C 5742</B>

<p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b> Cold War.  Conclusions</b>The U.S. proves the stronger, the Soviet Union implodes. Germany is reunified. Shorn of its empire and communist domination, Russia faces its future with its economy in chaos. The balance of terror that has kept the peace for more than 40 years vanishes. The Cold War has ended without the use of nuclear weapons. <B>Video/C 5742</B><p>

<p><dt><b>Grandma's Tattoos  </b><dd>Reveals the fate of thousands of forgotten women, mostly teenagers and young girls, who survived the 1915 Armenian Genocide but were forced into prostitution by their captors. Many of these women were tattooed as a permanent mark of their status. Filmmaker Suzanne Khardalian begins the film by remembering her grandmother: "Grandma Khanoum was not like everyone else. She had blue tattoos on her face and hands. She despised physical contact. She never hugged anyone, never gave kisses. And she always wore gloves, which hid her hands and her tattoos, and her secret." Haunted by these memories, Khardalian embarks on a personal journey into her family history to investigate the truth behind her late grandmother. Eventually small truths are revealed and pieces of the puzzle begin to come together. In 1919, just at the end of WWI, the Allied forces rescued nearly 100,000 Armenian girls and children who, during the war years, were forced to become prostitutes to survive, or had given birth to children after forced or arranged marriages or rape. These women were forcibly marked, tattooed, as property, the same way you mark cattle. Following the war, many of these women were viewed as impure and tainted, and often shunned by society.

Lech Walesa was the chief negotiator for the  workers, who avoided the mistakes of earlier strikes by maintaining strict nonviolent discipline--and by occupying their shipyard, to deter a violent crackdown by authorities. The strike quickly spread throughout the country and a new union was born named "Solidarity." The government imposed martial law and banned the union which continued its work underground until 1989 when it re-emerged as a revitalized political force, and won decisively in Poland's first free elections in 60 years.  2000.  31 min.   <B>Video/C 7376</B>

With personal accounts from Walesa, Geremek, Mazowiecki, Generals Jaruzelski and Kiszczak, and former Polish President Alexander Kwasniewski, including never-before-seen footage unearthed from Polish television archives, the film tells the secrets of Poland's past and throws light on its politics in the present.

<dt><B>Roma Rights</B>(Life; 5)<DD> The Roma have an exotic image: musicians, actors, artists, and sometimes beggars. Europeans called them 'Gypsies' because they thought they came from Egypt. But Romani people have lived in Europe for over a thousand years, and they originally came from India, not Egypt. Roma communities in Europe have been subjected to centuries of persecution and racism. They are one of the most excluded groups in the world. They are denied the chance to work, proper housing, healthcare and their children refused a decent education. A new initiative - the Decade of Roma Inclusion - was launched in 2005 in a concerted attempt to help break the desperate cycle of poverty in which so many Roma live.  Directed by Di Tatham. 2005. 23 min. <B>DVD 8385</B>

<P><dt><b>We Have No War-Songs: Gypsies: the Professional Amateurs of Life.</b><dd>Since their appearance in Europe first recorded in the 14th century, the Gypsies have always struggled for  the freedom to live their own lives in their own way. They have been persecuted, tortured, expelled and killed, and yet remain unique as the only nation of people that have never written or sung war songs. Filmed at the seven day gathering of thousands of Gypsies from all over the World in Saintes Maires de-la Mer in the South of France, this film celebrates the unique nature of the Gypsy people and poses questions of tolerance and individuality in today's increasingly materialistic and nationalistic world. A documentary by Izzy Abrahami and Erga Netzc.  1995. 53 min. <B>Video/C 6338</B>
