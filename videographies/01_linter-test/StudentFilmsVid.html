Documentary and experimental films produced by students at the University of California, Berkeley. Each of these nine diverse films broadly explores what separates the self from others and the fragile connective tissues that hold us together. In Your lips with cheese, students pose playfully for an existential yearbook cut-up. The part speaks for the whole when five family members are cleverly transformed into the fingers on a hand in Pamily. A budding bodybuilder pontificates on body image in Pimping Iron, unapologetically linking it to his experiences of romance. An animated subject flits and flickers into states of cinematic mitosis in Beside Myself. In Lettering, two wounded individuals bound by the rules of attraction transcend the laws of time and space as they attempt to reconnect. The documentary Chasing Intimacy endearingly pokes and prods at three couples negotiating the forever-permeable boundaries of love, sex, and self. In the riveting psychodrama Crimen, a guilty father revisits and reimagines crimes of procreation. In the intensely moving em nen khoc (you cannot cry), the death of a Vietnamese patriarch fosters a familial excavation of tradition. Lessons of human evolution are summed up sweetly in the animated Learn from Mistakes. Shown at the Pacific Film Archives, April 22, 2008.  DVD 9749

Chan (4 mins) -- Folie ?a deux / Elijah Wolfson (16 mins) -- Direction / Hector Jimenez (22 mins).
Documentary and experimental films produced by students at the University of California, Berkeley. Goldmine of Conscious Minds captures the spatial, temporal, and aural layers of Sproul Plaza. I Are Cinema confronts the genre of experimental film through a mashed-up parody of creative angst, and in turn, reveals the angst of parody. The Electric Arctic Circle charts the oblique, unraveling journey of three travelers venturing into the Great White North. In the documentary (Cache), two intertwining personal narratives are placed against the backdrop of San Francisco's Chinatown. Sin titulo explores the craft and art of making images amidst an askew urban setting. The absence of a friend engenders bittersweet romantic complications among three companions in Since You've Been Ong. Folie ?a deux addresses the obsession and voyeurism of both actors and audience, and Direction, a rapid-fire deconstruction of directorial intention, ends with the undoing of it all.

The Electric Arctic circle is an hallucinatory record of a beautiful, wild road trip undertaken by three friends on motorcycles.
