"Vance Jeffords (Barbara Stanwyck) is her father's daughter. And what a father! T.C. Jeffords is a cross between King Lear and Captain Bligh. Walter Huston, in his last role, manages to make this egomaniacal tyrant both frightening and likeable. He handily blows nominal leading man and Noir veteran Wendell Corey off this screen, but Stanwyck, in one of her last great performances, matches him in flamboyance and audacity.
When he remarries (jilting daughter for Easterner Judith Anderson's fortune) Stanwyck disfigures his new bride with a well thrown scissors! When he hangs her Mexican lover (Gilbert Roland) she embarks on a relentless campaign to ruin him. The film seems to revel in the mutual ruthlessness of father and daughter. It also boasts a vicious turn by Thomas Gomez as "El Tigre, T.C... Jeffords' chief pistolero who is eager to throw the rope over Gilbert Roland's neck. Gomez was fresh from his greatest role in Abraham Polonsky's "Force of Evil."
So in love are father and daughter, that although Stanwyck ultimately gains the upper hand and the ability to crush her father, she can't bring herself to do it. That job is outsourced to Gilbert Roland's vengeful, seemingly insane mother who guns the robber baron down in the street. " [Shepler, Michael.

When Vittorio captures Hondo to save his life, Angie tells the Apache chief that he is her husband.

<DT><B>Little Big Man   </B>(1970)<DD>Directed by Arthur Penn. Cast: Dustin Hoffman, Martin Balsam, Jeff Corey, Chief Dan George, Faye Dunaway, Richard Mulligan.  Jack Crabb (Dustin Hoffman) is 121 years old.  And he's done it all. He's been a full-fledged Cheyenne, an Indian fighter, a snake oil merchant, master gunman, drinking buddy of wild Bill Hickok, colleague of Buffalo Bill, and is the only survivor of Custer's  Last Stand. Crabb is either the Old West's most neglected hero or the biggest liar ever to cross  the Mississippi. Little Big Man is Jack Crabb's story. In their article, "The Hollywood Indian in <I>Little Big Man</I>:  A Revisionist View," Margo Kasdan and Susan Tavernetti comment:  " In <I>Little Big Man, </I>Arthur Penn directed a film that inverts the mythologies of American frontier history usually presented in the western genre, and, in particular, the story of the westward expansion.  The film combines established generic conventions--the post-Civil War period, Great Plains setting, conflict between whites and Indians--with a reconsideration of western history, a revisionist treatment of legendary figures of the time, of the western hero, and of Native Americans in a comic and ironic tone.  This combination makes the film distinctive (while at the same time sows the seeds for such contemporary westerns as <I>Dances with Wolves</I>). (<I>Film & History</I>, xxiii (1993), 70).

<p><dt><b>The Outlaw</b> (1943)<dd>Directed by Howard Hughes.  Cast:  Jack Beutel, Jane Russell, Walter Huston, Thomas Mitchell.  Howard Hughes shocked the film world with this high-voltage western adventure that featured the steamy screen debut of voluptuous Jane Russell. The first release of the film in 1941 caused so much indignation that the picture was withdrawn for over five years before its general release. Presents a provocative retelling of the sagebrush saga of Billy the Kid and Doc Holliday - and their heated rivalry for the love of the sultry Rio - explodes in a gripping and unforgettable climax as their fateful destinies collide with the legendary Sheriff Pat Garrett. 117 min. <b>DVD 1296 </b>

<P><dt><b>Pursued </b> (1947)<dd>Directed by  Raoul Walsh. Cast: 	Teresa Wright, Robert Mitchum, Judith Anderson, Dean Jagger.  "This film advanced the career of Robert Mitchum, a new star, and one who had already had a background in noir with the classic "Out of the Past" as well as in other noir-tinged works as "Undercurrent", "Crossfire" and "When Strangers Marry." Along with "The Furies," "Pursued" qualifies as one of the few Freudian Westerns in that the protagonist, Jeff Callam, has been adapted and raised by the Callams following the unsolved mass murder of his family. He is plagued by nightmares involving gunfire and flashing spurs but he can never clearly see the faces of his parent's killers. In the course of the film he loses a coin toss with his step-brother and goes off to fight in the Spanish American War.
On returning, he is forced to kill his step-brother in a gunfight and finds himself tormented by what he sees as an unnatural love for his step-sister. Combined with his recurring nightmares, Jeff proves a very modern figure, very like a shell-shocked G.I. returning from World War II. James Wong Howe, who had the same year, shot the classic noir boxing film, "Body and Soul," with John Garfield, brought a dark brooding look to the film, with the night scenes providing a visual portrait of the protagonist's inner torment."

Filmed in color at the majestic location of the title, Grand Canyon Trail stars Roy Rogers as a rancher going up against crooked mining engineer Regan, who has conned the eastern owner into believing that his mine is worthless. But his pretty secretary, Carol Martin is suspicious and travels to the ghost town masquerading as the boss' daughter.

The Bells of San Angelo was the second Republic Roy Rogers western to be filmed in the "new" Trucolor process (actually the old Magnacolor process).

In a novel scripting touch, Roy Rogers doesn't outwit the villains-and in fact is soundly beaten by the bad guys halfway through the film.

He was as successful at wiping out rustlers as he had been at everything else he'd tried. But the West was changing, and a free spirit like Horn was a liability to the men who had hired him. Based on the true story, Tom Horn presents a harsher, less romantic vision of the West, but one that remains true to the frontier's raging spirit. 97 mn. <B>DVD 5083</B>
