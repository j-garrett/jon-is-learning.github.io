Opium was the Shan farmers' only source of income and the guerillas began to take 10% of the crop as tax and transported it in convoys to Thailand to buy guns. And so  a deadly alliance was born. In the 1970s, as part of Richard Nixon's war on drugs, the U.S. joined in an all-out attack on  the convoys in union with the Thai police.  Lo Hsing-Han, the  first "King of Opium" was arrested but the opium trade  continued under the second "King of Opium", Khun Sa.  <B> Video/C 5296</B>

In 1993 the Shan People's Republic Committee declared itself no longer part of  the union of Burma. Lo Hsing-Han meanwhile joined the government forces and eventually brought Khun Sa to his knees,  regaining control once again over the narcotics trade, but this time for the military dictatorship. Today both men are rich and powerful, and the amount of opium produced in Shan State has increased ten-fold, flooding Europe and the United States with cheap heroin.  <B>Video/C 5298</B>

What leverage can society  use to put curbs on the more outrageous forms of media  expression while retaining a respect for creativity  and freedom of expression?

Millions of others displaced by machines across Appalachia and the rural South head north to begin a new life in Chicago, where they face overcrowded tenements and schools, and the familiar inequities of segregation.

Will they "naturally" reverse themselves or will America get to the point where disparities are so wide that we finally find the political will to take action?

</p><p><dt><b><A NAME="vincentwho">Vincent Who?</A></b><dd>	Looks at the legacy of the case of Vincent Chin, a young Chinese American man who was attacked and killed at his bachelor's party at a suburban Detroit bar by current and former autoworkers who were unhappy with competition from Japanese auto manufacturers. The case attracted wide attention after Chin's attackers struck a plea bargain and were sentenced to three thousand dollars in fines and three years in prison, time that they never were required to serve after posting bail. Indignation by the Asian American community and others led to further charges being filed against the perpetrators. The film explores how the murder of Vincent Chin continues to have meaning to society today, as well as how the hate crime remains unknown or forgotten in many Americans' minds.
