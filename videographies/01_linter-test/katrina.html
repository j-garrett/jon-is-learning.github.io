</p><p><dt><b>The Axe in the Attic </b><dd>In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, two filmmakers, drawn together by outrage, take a sixty-day road trip from New England to New Orleans. Along the way they meet evacuees and witness the loss, dignity, perseverance and humor of people who have become exiles in their own country. The breakdown of trust between a government and its citizens, the influence of race, class, and gender, as well as the ethics of documentary filmmaking itself, form the backdrop for this universal story of the search for home.  Directed, and written by Lucia Small and Ed Pincus.  2007.  110 min.  	<B> DVD X195</B>

<p><dt><b>Storm that Drowned a City</b><DD>
    Featuring eyewitness testimony, takes an in-depth look at what made Hurricane Katrina so deadly and analyzes how, despite technically sophisticated flood and storm defenses, this event has resulted in unprecedented destruction for the Gulf Coast.

Combining a penetrating analysis of what went wrong with a dramatic, minute-by-minute unfolding of events told through eyewitness testimony, investigates such questions as: What made this storm so deadly? Will powerful hurricanes like Katrina strike more often? How accurately did scientists predict its impact, and why did the levees protecting New Orleans fail?

<p><dt><b>Wade in the Water</b><DD>	Through a mixture of private videos, and uncensored interviews, the children of New Orleans' violent Central City neighborhood have created a riveting look at life in New Orleans through the eyes of its children. The film class at Singleton Charter School invited students to take video cameras home and tell their stories expressing their thoughts in the chaos after Katrina. Through their own remarkably honest and unusual footage, we enter the kids shuttered housing projects, flooded homes and darkened streets to discover a New Orleans that was a disaster long before Katrina, a place where role models are scarce and gun violence is normal.
