<p><dt><b>Crossing the Line</b><DD>This documentary analyzes how mixed race comedians mediate multiracial identities and humor. Crossing lines of racial, ethnic, and cultural acceptability by their very existence, multiracial comedians reveal that meanings of race vary across ethnic combination, gender, place, and time. The film features the experiences, perspectives, and performances of American comedians of more than one racial ancestry. The timeliness of multiracial comedians' roles as crossracial mediators is underscored as they provide insight into controversies over how comedians express race (i.e., Michael Richards' use of the N-word, Rosie O' Donnell's slurs), and other debated meanings of race in an increasingly diverse society. Exploring these questions exposes the very nature of where pain and laughter come from in a racially divided world. Special features: Disc 2, (77 min.) Special educational features: extended interviews with Paul Spickard and Reginald Daniel; extended comedy routines by Jim Ruel, Tessie Chua; game/interactive class activity, Where's the line? Based on Darby Li Po Price's Mixed laughter : mediating multiracial identities in American ethnic comedy (Ph.D. diss., University of California, Berkeley, 1998) (Main  308t 1998 863) 59 min.  	 <B>DVD X899</B>

<dt><b>More to the Chinese Side. </b><dd>"I used to think that we were the typical Asian American family," muses William Gow, a fifth-generation Chinese American of biracial descent, as several family members describe instances of how they are commonly mistaken for other ethnicities. Intrigued by thesemisperceptions, Gow invites his parents and other relatives to share their experiences and views on how they see themselves in relation to the larger Asian American community. His Caucasian mother and Chinese father provide insights into raising biracial children; his Chinese cousin observes how being adopted repeatedly throws off people's expectations of him. Interspersed with historical details about Chinese immigration to the U.S., the interviews warmly touch upon the complexities of a family negotiating ethnic identities within an Asian American community that is constantly changing. 17 min.  <B>Video/C MM298</B></P><p>
