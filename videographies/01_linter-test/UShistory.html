<DD><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> Lecture 1. Revolutions and wars for independence -- Lecture 2. Origins of revolution in the Atlantic world -- Lecture 3. Colonial empires on the eve of revolution -- Lecture 4. The North American revolution emerges. <U>Revolutions and wars for independence</U>: Sets the major themes of the video series, along with a discussion of the concepts of "revolution" and "wars for independence.".  <U>Origins of revolution in the Atlantic world</U>: Looks at the most important transformations that shaped the Atlantic world by the mid-18th century, including the Enlightenment, developing commerce and trade, the industrial revolution and new political theories which ushered in an age of political revolutions.  <I>Colonial empires on the eve of revolution</I>: Between 1492 and 1750, the Spanish, Portuguese, French, and English had carved out large colonial empires. This lecture surveys those colonial empires, their dimensions and characteristics in 1750.  <U>North American revolution emerges</U>: In the dissimilar American colonies, a sense of unity emerged out of the colonial wars that the English fought, especially with the French in the 1750s and 1760s. These decades precipitated the emergence of a sense of an "American" identity among the English colonists, eventually resulting in a move towards independence in 1775 and 1776.  <B>Video/C MM283  </B>

Slave rebellion in St. Dominigue -- Lecture 8. Haitian Revolution. <U>From Lexington and Concord to Yorktown</U>: Covers the fighting during the American Revolution from Lexington and Concord to the British surrender at Yorktown in 1781, an extraordinary story of a small group of colonials challenging and defeating the most powerful empire in the world.  <U>Radicalism of the American Revolution</U>: Discusses the "meaning" of the American Revolution. For some, it was a conservative effort by planters to sieze power and control the development of a society already divided between slaves and free men, white and non-whites, and the landed and landless. For others, it represented a radical break with a monarchical past and a move towards a republic and democratic politics. <U> Slave rebellion in St. Dominigue</U>: The Haitain revolution is the only successful slave rebellion in the Americas. This section and the next analyze the only case of slaves rising up, taking power, and creating an independent nation. Also looks at the French revolution and its influence on Saint Domingue, a classic example of the sugar and slave plantation complex in the Americas. <U>Haitian Revolution</U>: In 1791, thousands of slaves rose up in St. Domingue, in a war for their freedom. Amidst the violence, a group of black leaders emerged, the most famous the former slave Toussaint L'Ouverture. Over more than a decade the slaves defeated invading armies from France, England, and Spain, but the black leadership eventually turned against itself in a struggle for control of the revolution.  <B>Video/C MM284</B>

 <p><dt><b>Edward R. Murrow Collection:  The McCarthy Years.  </b><DD>Narrated by Walter Cronkite, this documentary turns back the clock to the 1950s, a time when the country lurched into a murky period of blacklists and witch-hunts for alleged communists, all led by a young Senator named Joseph McCarthy. Murrow made a controversial series of broadcasts that challenge McCarthy's abuses of power, which -- as this program investigates -- signaled the emergence of television news as a highly influential force in American life.  <B>DVD 4009; also VHS Video/C 3167</B></b>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>Explosion.</b>   The World War of 1914 to 1918, the Great War, was the first of the major catastrophes of the 20th century. This episode, the first of eight, examines the causes of World War I. The program affords coverage of the assassination of the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the turbulent political climate throughout Europe as factors which led to the outbreak of war.  <B>Video/C 5256</B><p>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>Stalemate.</b>  This program examines the military operations of 1914, with emphasis on the Western Front. Almost from the outset, World War I became a stalemate with a line of trenches stretching from the Swiss Alps to the English Channel. This episode, the second of eight, explores why the war devolved into one of trench warfare.  <B>Video/C 5256</B> <p>  

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Total War.</b>   This episode of the Great War, the third of eight, examines the evolution of World War I from a conflict fought across the landscape of Europe to a global war. Coverage is afforded events in Great Britain and Turkey. The use of terror in modern war and the evolution of "total war"  -- especially regarding aerial and chemical weapons -- is explored in this program. <B>Video/C 5257</B><p>

This episode, the fourth of eight, examines the military operations of the Western Front through the eyes of the soldiers who manned the trenches and fought the battles. Through study of the battles of Verdun, the Somme and Passchendaele, a social portrait of the common soldier is developed and analyzed. <B>Video/C 5257</B><p>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Mutiny</b>. This episode of the Great War, the fifth of an eight part series, examines the toll that the war was taking on the soldiers and civilians by 1917. Unrest on the homefront and mutiny on the Western Front posed vexing problems for political leaders and military planners. On the Eastern Front, resentment toward the war effort would turn into rebellion and then revolution. <B>Video/C 5258</B><p>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Collapse</b>.   Episode six of the Great War examines the critical year of 1918. After the mutiny within the French Army and revolution in Russia, the Germans were still firmly entrenched on the Western Front.

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>The Reluctant Revolutionaries.</b> In 1763 American colonists were happily British, and proud to be subjects of King George. With the end of the French and Indian war, America became a land of opportunity, and the future founding fathers were poised to take advantage of it. Then the British imposed a seemingly routine tax--the Stamp Act. It created a firestorm throughout the colonies as Americans saw their liberties and power threatened. Benjamin Franklin found himself in the center of controversy as relations between England and America unravelled. <B>Video/C 5411</B>

<p>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Blows Must Decide.</b> By the fall of 1774 British troops occupied Boston, and the thirteen colonies took faltering steps to unite in reaction to British aggression. Thomas Paine's pamphlet, Common Sense, turned the tide toward independence. It questioned the very nature of monarchy, stating that it was the right of men to govern themselves. On July 2, 1776, independence was declared, and two days later Congress ratified the Declaration of Independence. <B>Video/C 5411 </B>


<p>
<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>The Times That Try Men's Souls.</b> Days after the Declaration of Independence was signed an immense British force dropped anchor in New York harbor, pitting the largest professional army in the world against George Washington's army of untrained volunteers. Washington wanted to conduct the war in proper 18th cent. style, but after an early string of defeats he realized he had to avoid fighting at all costs and keep his army on the run. On Dec. 26, 1776, Washington led his army across the Delaware River, surprising a garrison of Hessian soldiers at Trenton. <B>Video/C 5412 </B>



<p>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Oh Fatal Ambition!</b> All of Europe, and especially France, Britain's rival in Europe and the New World, is interested in the outcome of the American Revolution. In an attempt to capitalize on the rivalry, Congress dispatched Franklin to Versaillles in late 1776 to seek financial and military support. When British Gen. Burgoyne was defeated at Saratoga, France entered the war, and a world war began.<B> Video/C 5412</B>

<p>
<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b> The World Turned Upside Down.</b> How do Americans, fighting in the name of liberty, justify the institution of slavery? The British hoped to exploit the contradictions posed by slavery and enlist the support of loyalists in the South, but they failed. The convergence of Washington's army and the French fleet at Yorktown trapped a weary British army led by Lord Cornwallis. Two years later, the Treaty of Paris was signed, ending eight years of fighting. <B>Video/C 5413</B><p>

<p>
<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Are We To Be a Nation?</b>Following the war, the nation faced a new set of challenges: bankruptcy, no common currency, no national army, states acting like sovereign nations, and no strong government capable of dealing with these problems. In 1776 a constitutional convention met in Philadelphia which ratified a new system of government and included the Bill of Rights. The revolutionary idea that power should flow upward from the people instead of downward from a king heralded the birth of modern politics. <B>Video/C 5413 </B>



<p><dt><b>The Living Past: Commitments for the Future</b><dd>Professor Bernard Bailyn speaks on the historical connections between the country's past and its present.

Navigating this great liquid divide on an assortment of canoes, rafts, steamboats, towboats and fishing vessels, Blount explores what holds this wildly diverse country together. Blount's unpredictable odyssey celebrates the full range of American diversity and eccentricity-- from a wedding ceremony at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, to a rodeo at America's toughest prison in Angola, Louisiana.  2002. 56 min. <B>Video/C MM709 </B>

<p><dt><b>The March of the Bonus Army</b><DD>In 1932, in the darkest days of the Depression, unemployed World War I veterans marched on Washington, D.C., looking for an advance on the bonus compensation promised to them years earlier. After camping throughout Washington for two months, the veterans were driven out by force. Under the command of General Douglas MacArthur and his officers Dwight Eisenhower and George Patton, they drove the veterans from Washington and burned their camps. The Bonus Army became a political liability for President Herbert Hoover. In 1936, Congress finally agreed to pay the Bonus and nearly four million veterans benefited. The epic march set in motion a string of events that influenced the rights of veterans, including WWII's GI bill, plus the rights of citizens to assemble and petition the government. Based on the book "The Bonus army, an American epic" by Thomas B. Allen and Paul Dickson.  c2006. 30 min.  <B>DVD 5654</B>

In this film the people who were there remember the blow as workers from the United States, Chile, Britain, Belgium and Scandinavia recall the hungry 1930s.  <B>Video/C 5550</B> 





<p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Great Escape, 1927.</b>  By the mid-1920s, millions worldwide were already confirmed "moviegoers". Movies reflected and affected the way people dressed, thought and spoke, teaching the inexperienced about love and courage, while the governments around the globe were quick to realize the power of film: this new mass entertainment would also prove an unrivaled tool of mass persuasion. Here moviegoers reminisce, revealing how the new medium persuaded, influenced and entralled them, as it offered a welcome refuge from the century's pressures. <B>Video/C 5549</B>

<p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Killing Fields, 1914.</b> In August 1914, the people of Europe were swept into the first of the wars that would make this century the bloodiest ever. Seventy million soldiers from more than twenty countries marched off to do their duty. In this film soldiers from all sides give a personal account of the trenches and the tactics--and the terrible nature and scale of the slaughter that shattered the old world order. In the end, four empires collapsed and nine million gave their lives. Some became pacificts while others sought retribution and many found themselves fighting another war only two decades later. <B> Video/C 5543</B>

<p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b> Lost Peace, 1919</b>  After the First World War a whole generation was traumatized by the horror of war and vowed that war would be a thing of the past. This film revists the popular hopes and experiences in the years following World War I--and the looming threat of a new nationalism. Despite Woodrow Wilson's promise of a "people's peace", defeated nations were resentful and unreconciled. As fascism and militarism spread, worldwide pacifist movements fought an increasingly unsuccessful rearguard action to preserve the dream of peace. <B>Video/C 5547</B>

<p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b> On the Line, 1924.</b>  When Henry Ford's Model T rolled onto the scene in 1908, it was inconceivable that it would ever be anything more than a plaything for the wealthy. But mass production and later, Ford's moving assembly line, allowed manufacturers to produce goods at affordable prices that made them accessible to a new mass market. This film follows the acceleration of mass production, from the days of master craftsmen to the pressures and benefits of assembly-line work to the growing strength of "people power" as labor and management struggled to divide the fruits of increased productivity. <B>Video/C 5546</B>

This film follows boxing, baseball, soccer, and more, as sports transition from a modest pastime to a fiercely competitive--and commercial-- business to a potent expression of national pride and politics. Throughout, sports fans the world over remember the drama, the thrill, the exhilaration--and the patriotism--their favorite athletes and sports teams aroused. Includes a look at the role of American sportswriters, and live radio and television broadcasting of sporting events. <B>Video/C 5545</B>

The American Marshall Plan assisted Europe greatly in its recovery from the war and helped Europeans learn the 'American way' of doing things. Europeans began changing their economy by themselves and became consumers as well as producers. This prosperity lasted until 1973, when the certainty of cheap oil and a world dominated by the West was over. It was the beginning of the end of the greatest boom of the century.<B> Video/C 6444</B>

By 1968, the conservative '50s had been overtaken by full-blown social and political revolt. In Europe, students rioted and demonstrated for greater intellectual freedom--and against the rigid values of the parents' generation.

In Iran, a resurgence in Islamic fundamentalism led to a revolt against the Shah and to the return of the long exiled Ayatollah Khomeini.

<P><DD><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border=0><B>Disc 1, A Nation of Drunkards </B>  	The 19th century was a period of growth both for alcoholic beverages and the temperance movement. The women's crusade of 1873 was essentially a general strike by women whose protest spread to 911 communities in 37 territories. However no laws had been changed and within a few years, saloons were back in business. In 1879, Frances E. Willard became the head of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Carrie Nation and her home defenders army started closing saloons in Kansas but it too failed to change laws. By the turn of the 20th century, there were some 300,000 saloons in America. Saloons were not only social centers but places where you could look for jobs or learn to speak English. The Anti-Saloon league was the most successful pressure group in America and the most effective in making alcohol a wedge issue. The brewers fought back but the temperance movement continued to grow, leading to the passing of the 19th Amendment.

<P><DD><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border=0><B>Disc 2, A Nation of Scofflaws</B> 	With the passing of the 19th Amendment to the US Constitution, the federal government now passes legislation to enforce it. Known as the Volstead Act, the legislation forbids not only hard liquor but also beer and light wine which many legislators assumed would be exempted. Penalties as well were far harsher than many had expected. The ban on alcoholic beverages could not be complete as alcohol was required by many industrial processes, religious observances and for medicinal purposes. From the day the ban went into into effect,entrepreneurs found ways, some legal, most not - to get around the law. Rum running. became big business with schooners plying their trade on both the Pacific and Atlantic sides of the U.S. By the mid-1920s many people had come to the conclusion that prohibition was a mistake. Those who drank were drinking more and with no way for government to regulate the illegal industry, they were also drinking bad liquor. Criminal gangs sprang up across the country but Chicago became synonymous with vice and booze. 110 min.

<P><DD><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border=0><B>Disc 3, A Nation of Hypocrites </B> 	By the mid-1920s, a great many people had become convinced that prohibition was a serious mistake. Al Smith was adamant that as President, he would repeal the 18th Amendment. While alcohol consumption continued to rise, nothing demonstrated the failure of prohibition as did the rise of organized crime and the man who became the poster boy for crime and bootlegging, Al Capone. Soon, Pauline Sabin organized a national movement to restore the legal sale of alcoholic beverages. By the time Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected in 1932, beer was being sold and in less than a year, the 19th Amendment was repealed. 94 min.

</p><p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10">1:  <b>The People.</b>To the original Native American inhabitants, the West  has been a land of myth. To the Europeans, such as Cabeza de Vaca and Coronado, the West was a "wilderness" to be conquered. Nearly 100 years before the American Revolution, the Pueblo people of the Southwest rose up against their European  masters and drove the Spanish from their lands. Then, with America's purchase of the Louisiana Territory in 1804, Lewis and Clark set off to find the fabled Northwest Passage, as a confident young nation prepared for its own epic march across the West.  85 min.   <B>DVD X1627; vhs Video/C 4519</B></p><p> 

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10">2:  <b> Empire Upon the Trails.</b>  In the early 1800's, no one knew who would control the seemingly infinite spaces of the West but hopeful Americans moved onward toward "Manifest Destiny", as they determined to make the West their own. Mountain  men, such as Joe Meek, found more adventure than profit as they searched for furs. Missionaries such as Narcissa Whitman traveled West along with others who tried their luck on the Oregon Trail while in Mexican Texas, Sam Houston carved out his own independent republic.  85 min. <B> DVD X1627; vhs Video/C 4520</B>

</p><p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10">3:  <b> The Speck of the Future.</b> A history of the California gold rush which started in 1848, when a sawmill worker named James Marshall reached down into the streambed of the American River in California and discovered gold. Wild mining camps  sprung up with each new strike while overnight San Francisco turned into an international city. 85 min.  <B>DVD X1627; vhs Video/C 4521</B>



</p><p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10">4:  <b>  Death Runs Riot.</b> In the 1850s, as more American pioneers poured west, they brought with them the nation's oldest, most divisive issue--slavery--and the rough frontier would supply the sparks that would ignite the Civil War. Indians would be dragged into "the white man's war," while the besieged Mormons would commit the worst massacre of innocent pioneers in American history and a young writer named Sam Clemens would find adventure in Nevada's silver camps. And as the bitter Civil War drew to a close, celebrated Union heros such as George Armstrong Custer and William Tecumseh Sherman would use the tactics which had defeated the South against the Native Americans of the West.  85 min. <B> DVD X1627; vhs Video/C 4522</B></p><p>  

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10">5:  <b>The Grandest Enterprise Under God.</b>After the Civil War Americans embarked on one of the greatest technological achievements of the age-- building the first transcontinental railroad to conquer forbidding mountains, harsh deserts and  awesome distances. Railroads soon transformed the West, bringing European farmers, while cowpokes such as Teddy Blue Abbott would ride dusty cattle trails to deliver herds to railheads such as Dodge and Abilene, while buffalo hunters such as Frank Mayer would drive a magnificent animal to near extinction.  85 min. <B> DVD X1627; vhs Video/C 4523</B>

</p><p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10">6:  <b>Fight No More Forever.</b> By the 1870s there were only a few pockets of resistance against the nation's push to conquer the West. On the Great Plains, Sitting Bull followed his mystical visions and urged his Lakota people to fight rather than surrender their sacred Black Hills and  traditional way of life. Custer's "Last stand" would also become, in effect, the last stand of the Sioux as a free people. In Utah, the Morman patriarch Brigham Young would be forced to choose between saving his church or sacrificing his spiritual son. Farther west, Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce would find himself helping to lead one of the most extraordinary military compaigns in American history.  87 min. <B> DVD X1627; vhs Video/C 4524</B>

</p><p><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10">7:  <b>The Greography of Hope.</b>  By the 1870s the American conquest of the West was nearly complete. In one decade, with Native Americans effectively confined to reservations, some four-and-a-half million new settlers would arrive to stake their claim to the future. Pap Singleton, an  ex-slave from Tennessee, became the era's "Black Moses," leading his people to the free soil of Kansas. A frail New York politician, Teddy Roosevelt, transformed himself into a rugged North Dakota rancher, and eventually, president of the United States. And as Americans tried to "tame" the West, the nation's greatest showman, Buffalo Bill Cody, instead offered adoring crowds his enthusiastic version of a "Wild West"--heroic, glorious, romantic, and most of all, mythic. 87 min. <B> DVD X1627; vhs Video/C 4525</B></p><p>  

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10">8: <b> Ghost Dance</b>  By the late 1880s, the Americans were astounded by the changes they had brought to the West. Mining towns such as Butte, Montana were now full-fledged industrial cities. Defeated militarily, Native Americans throughout the region now flocked to the  call of a Paiute mystic, who offered the illusionary hope that the lost world of the buffalo could be brought back by a Ghost Dance. But its promises would be trampled in the snow and blood of Wounded Knee. In place of the great Native American cultures which once dominated the Plains was a new culture, epitomized by the Oklahoma Land Rush, in which 100,000 eager settlers lined up for a mad dash to stake out a farm and a future.60 min.  <B>DVD X1627; vhs Video/C 4526</B></p><p> 

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10">9:  <b> One Sky Above Us.</b> As the 20th century neared, Americans celebrated with the World Columbian Exposition, where they were told that the frontier had closed, but in the real West, for every frontier story that ended, another one began. Some Native Americans waged a struggle to hold onto their traditions in the midst of rapid, overwhelming change, while others chose to learn the white man's ways, hoping to help their families and their tribe. In California, the emerging metropolis of Los Angeles waged yet another battle to control the arid region's most precious commodity--water. Much had changed in the West, but it continued to be what it had always been--a landscape of the imagination, the reservoir of our shared hopes and dreams, a place of both conflict and infinite possibility, and an enduring symbol of something unquestionably American. 65 min. <B> DVD X1627; vhs Video/C 4527</B></p><p>
