<br>
<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><B>A Nation of Drunkards</B><DD>The 19th century was a period of growth both for alcoholic beverages and the temperance movement. The women's crusade of 1873 was essentially a general strike by women whose protest spread to 911 communities in 37 territories. However no laws had been changed and within a few years, saloons were back in business. In 1879, Frances E. Willard became the head of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Carrie Nation and her home defenders army started closing saloons in Kansas but it too failed to change laws. By the turn of the 20th century, there were some 300,000 saloons in America. Saloons were not only social centers but places where you could look for jobs or learn to speak English. The Anti-Saloon league was the most successful pressure group in America and the most effective in making alcohol a wedge issue. The brewers fought back but the temperance movement continued to grow, leading to the passing of the 19th Amendment. 94 min.
 <br>
<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><B>A Nation of Scofflaws</B><DD>With the passing of the 19th Amendment to the US Constitution, the federal government now passes legislation to enforce it. Known as the Volstead Act, the legislation forbids not only hard liquor but also beer and light wine which many legislators assumed would be exempted. Penalties as well were far harsher than many had expected. The ban on alcoholic beverages could not be complete as alcohol was required by many industrial processes, religious observances and for medicinal purposes. From the day the ban went into into effect,entrepreneurs found ways, some legal, most not - to get around the law. Rum running. became big business with schooners plying their trade on both the Pacific and Atlantic sides of the U.S. By the mid-1920s many people had come to the conclusion that prohibition was a mistake. Those who drank were drinking more and with no way for government to regulate the illegal industry, they were also drinking bad liquor. Criminal gangs sprang up across the country but Chicago became synonymous with vice and booze. 110 min.

 <br>
<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><B>A Nation of Hypocrites </B><DD>	By the mid-1920s, a great many people had become convinced that prohibition was a serious mistake. Al Smith was adamant that as President, he would repeal the 18th Amendment. While alcohol consumption continued to rise, nothing demonstrated the failure of prohibition as did the rise of organized crime and the man who became the poster boy for crime and bootlegging, Al Capone. Soon, Pauline Sabin organized a national movement to restore the legal sale of alcoholic beverages. By the time Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected in 1932, beer was being sold and in less than a year, the 19th Amendment was repealed. 94 min.

Part one addresses the mass appeal of movies, including their portrayals of sex and violence which have made them a target of censors since the early days.
