This program reports on the town's efforts in 1957 to comply with the U.S. Supreme Court's mandate in the face of coercive opposition. Footage of the Rev. Paul Turner preaching brotherhood and John Kasper expounding in his rhetoric of intolerance creates a vivid portrait of the times.

Filmed in 1962, this program reveals the double standards and the dangers faced by African-Americans registering to vote in Mississippi. Interviews with local officials, segregationists, lawyers, clergy and citizens on both sides of the color line expose what amounted to a tacit conspiracy to deprive certain people of their constitutional right to stand up and be counted. Originally aired on the CBS Television Network on September 26, 1962  on CBS Reports. 57 min.  <B>Video/C 7363 </B>

<br><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>  The Color Line on Campus. </b>   For most U.S. colleges today, racial diversity is a goal -- but almost nine years after the Brown decision, it was quite another story.

Faced with attitudes ranging from passive tolerance to violent rejection, each had achieved enrollment, but not acceptance.

In this program, filmed ten years after Brown, news correspondents report on the mixed progress made toward integrating public schools in Nashville, New Rochelle, New Orleans and Prince Edward County, Virginia. Stumbling blocks such as faculty segregation, busing and segregational zoning are examined. A discussion featuring Attorney Gen.

<br><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>  Segregation -- Northern Style  </b>   In many places above the Mason-Dixon Line, a subtle form of bigotry was at work during the early 1960s, resisting the efforts of Afro-Americans to buy homes in historically white neighborhoods. In this 1964 program, Mike Wallace reveals the fallacies, attitudes and weak legislation that contributed to de facto segregation in the North by tracking the unsuccessful compaign of a middle-class black family to buy in upscale New Jersey. The positive contributions of fair housing and civil rights groups are also presented. Reporter: Mike Wallace. Originally aired on the CBS Television Network in 1964.  58 min.  <B>Video/C 7366 </B>

<br><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b> Black Power -- White Backlash  </b>   When the radical wing of the civil rights movement began equating redress with rebellion rather than nonviolent protest, "Black power" became the rallying cry.

Interviews with major figures of the movement discussing black militancy,   economic power, fair housing, nonviolence, and the tensions in Cicero, Illinois, the Selma of the North capture the fervor of 1966. Reporter: Mike Wallace.  Originally aired on the CBS.  56 min.  <B>Video/C 7367</B>

<br><dt><b>Constructing Public Opinion: How Politicians and the Media Misrepresent the Public</b><dd>The media regularly use public opinion polls in their reporting of important news stories. But how exactly do they report them and to what end? In this interview, Professor Justin Lewis demonstrates the way in which polling data are themselves used by media to not just reflect what Americans think but instead to construct public opinion itself. Addressing issues such as the role the media play in "manufacturing consent" for political elites, what polls really tell us about public opinion, and what Americans actually think about politics, the program provides a new way to think about the relationship between politics, media and the public. 2001. 31 min. <B>Video/C 8761</B>

See It Now produced in the 50s by CBS, though not television's first public affairs program, was surely its most significant. Hosted by Edward R. Murrow, it was the first public affairs show to use its own film footage instead of newsreel; no interviews were rehearsed and it pioneered the use of field producers, who supervised the filming on location. Its first show on Nov. 18, 1951 marked the first commercial coast-to-coast television broadcast. c1985. 112 min. <B>Video/C 7142</B><br>

<br><dt><b> Fear and Favor in the Newsroom.</b><dd> Examines the need to protect freedom of the press and investigative journalism in the United States when newspapers and television stations are owned and influenced by large corporations hostile to media exposure. Examines case studies of investigative journalists who have been dismissed or forced to resign because of "too aggressive" journalistic practices  and cases of censorship mandated by television and print media management.


<br>"Fear & Favor in the Newsroom demonstrates how ownership of the press by a small corporate elite constricts the free flow of ideas and information on which our democracy depends. The testimony of some of the nation's most distinguished journalists - including four Pulitzer Prize winners - shatters the myth perpetrated by the media themselves that editorial decisions are made "without fear or favor." Internalizing the lessons of spiked stories, demotions and firings, journalists quickly learn to censor themselves rather than aggressively pursue stories which might conflict with the interests of their corporate employers. Fear & Favor in the Newsroom provokes important questions and discussions about ownership of the 'free press.'"   1996. 56 min. <B>Video/C 4474</B>

<br><dt><b> Images in Media </b><dd>The pictures in our heads that define who we are and help us neatly categorize others are increasingly shaped by newspaper, magazine, film, and TV images.

<br><dt><b> McLibel: Two Worlds Collide</b><dd>  A documentary of two individuals who took on the  McDonald's Corporation. Using interviews with witnesses and reconstructions of key moments in court, the film examines the main issues in the libel trial-- nutrition, animals, advertising, employment, the environment--and the implications for freedom of speech. In the process of this longest trial in English history, the defendants faced infiltration by spies, secret meetings with corporate executives, 40,,000 pages of background reading and a visit from Ronald McDonald. <br>

"Banned in the UK. The film McDonald's does not want you to see!  McDonald's spends $1.8 billion a year on advertising. At the same time it tries to suppress any other information about its operations reaching the public. This is the story of how one such attempt at censorship turned into a public relations disaster. McLibel is the dramatic and inspiring story of how two ordinary but principle people took on one of the world's most powerful global corporations.

<br><dt><b>The Mean World Syndrome</b> <dd>For years, debates have raged among scholars, politicians, and concerned parents about the effects of media violence on viewers. Too often these debates have descended into simplistic battles between those who claim that media messages directly cause violence and those who argue that activists exaggerate the impact of media exposure altogether. Based on the groundbreaking work of media scholar George Gerbner, urges us to think about media effects in more nuanced ways. Ranging from Hollywood movies and prime-time dramas to reality programming and the local news, the film examines how media violence forms a pervasive cultural environment that cultivates in heavy viewers, especially, a heightened state of insecurity, exaggerated perceptions of risk and danger, and a fear-driven propensity for hard-line political solutions to social problems. A provocative and accessible introduction to cultivation analysis, media effects research, and the subject of media influence and media violence more generally.  Based on the work of media scholar George Gerbner. c2010.  75 min.  <B>DVD X2622</B>

<br><dt><b>The Myth of the Liberal Media: The  Propaganda Model of News</b><dd>Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky discuss their comprehensive framework for understanding how the news is produced and in whose interests it works. They argue that the news media is subordinated to corporate and conservative interests and is not liberal.<br>  Pt. 1. The filters of news: the propaganda model & agenda setting -- the ownership filter -- the advertising filter -- the sourcing filter -- the flak filter. -- Pt. 2. Domestic issues: the healthcare debate -- the attack on social programs -- the coverage of labor and business. -- Pt. 3. International issues: anti-communism & market celebration (Yeltsin and reform in Russia; attacking the Cuban revolution) -- dictators and democracy (Saddam Hussein; Suharto in Indonesia). <br>"Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky demolish one of the central tenets of our political culture, the idea of the "liberal media." Instead, utilizing a systematic model based on massive empirical research, they reveal the manner in which the news media are so subordinated to corporate and conservative interests that their function can only be described as that of "elite propaganda." Part One outlines the key notion of the "filters" through which the process of news passes, ensuring that what emerges for public consumption reflects the interests that control journalistic practices. Part Two focuses on several examples of how coverage of key domestic issues shapes public understanding. In Part Three, Chomsky and Herman examine the way that international issues are framed by the media to reflect the interests of political and economic elites."    1997. 60 min.  <B>DVD 4890; also vhs Video/C 5743</B>

The War You Don't See traces the history of `embedded' and independent reporting from the carnage of World War I to the destruction of Hiroshima, and from the invasion of Vietnam to the current war in Afghanistan. As weapons and propaganda are ever more sophisticated, the very nature of war has developed into an `electronic battlefield'. But who is the real enemy today?

<br><dt><b>Beyond Good & Evil: Children, Media and Violent Times.</b><dd>Intro: Where were you? -- A simple story -- Playing at war -- Constructing the enemy.  "Full of poignant footage and moving responses from children, exposes how the media has been used to earn public support for the U.S.-led military campaign against Iraq. The news coverage, as well as movies, television shows and video games that have incorporated the narrative of war into their storylines, has an especially profound influence on children, who often bring both entertainment and real-world violence to their play. This video examines how the "good and evil" rhetoric, in both the entertainment and the news media, has helped children to dehumanize the enemies, justify their killing and treat the suffering of innocent civilians as necessary sacrifice." c2003. 37 min. <B>DVD 6703</B>

Violence is a social relationship -- 5. Lessons of violence -- 6. Citizenship in the cultural environment -- 7. What parents, teachers, and schools can do.  Host, Jean Kilbourne, with George Gerbner. Explores why there is so much violence on television and its effects on viewers. Addresses psychological, political,  social, and developmental impacts of growing and living within a cultural environment of pervasive, ritualized violent
 representation. Suggests new ways of thinking about the  negative effects of mass media on society, and discusses what  can be done. Questions and ideas are based on the results of a  20-year ongoing study, the Cultural Indicators Project, by Dr.  George Gerbner.  <br>

"Addressing the question of violence and the media, Gerbner urges us to think about the effects of the media in new and complex ways. In contrast to the relatively simplistic behaviorist theory that media violence causes real-world violence, he encourages us to think about the psychological, political, social, and development impacts of growing up and living within a cultural environment of pervasive, ritualized violent images. Media violence is not a simple act, but the representation of a complex social relationship that teaches who can get away with what against whom. It is an important socializing factor in cultivating ideas about the nature of the social world."   c1994.41 min.   <B>DVD 4889; also vhs Video/C 3581</B><br> <br>

<b>Gerald Ford's America </b><dd>Scrutinizes the "first one hundred days" of the Ford presidency. In Part 1 WIN (the title refers to the slogan "Whip Inflation Now"), the TVTV crew follows Ford on a goodwill tour of his old constituency in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Having promised to end the "national nightmare" of Vietnam and Watergate, Ford took office only to face inflation and a looming recession. Ironically contrasting political rhetoric with the reality of working and middle-class America, TVTV juxtaposes a main point of Ford's platform -- that Americans should curb their spending habits -- with a GOP fundraiser in which wealthy patrons bid extravagantly for a football once held by Ford. In Part 2 Chick to sheik, the filmmakers examine the assertion that political deal-making occurs at the social level, they take careful note of the high cost of entertaining: $10,000 for one diplomatic function. As an ironic footnote to history, the tape culminates in a party for the Shah of Iran at the Iranian Embassy, complete with birthday toasts to the soon-to-be-ousted ruler.  [Part 1] Win (28 min.), 1975 -- [Part 2] Chic to sheik (28 min.), 1975.  Produced by TVTV and the TV Lab at WNET/Thirteen; producer, David Loxton.

<b>Lord of the Universe</b><dd>The first independent video documentary made for national broadcast on public television, The Lord of the Universe is an expose of the Guru Maharaj Ji and his Millenium '73 gathering at the Houston Astrodome. With a scathing economy, TVTV lays bare the corruption and hypocrisy of the Maharaj Ji and his entourage, showing the guru as he dispenses pseudo-mystical knowledge to his true believers, led by former antiwar  activist Rennie Davis. TVTV's use of portable video equipment afforded them access to the guru's entourage and the duped devotees of the new religion, faded flower children whose yearning for order and meaning seem emblematic of the nation's disaffection and uncertainty in the Watergate and Vietnam era.

<b>The World's Largest TV Studio </b><dd>In 1972, TVTV brought their low-budget, free-form journalistic techniques to the floor of the Democratic Presidential Convention in Miami. Using lightweight, 1/2-inch Portapak equipment, which allowed them greater mobility and spontaneity than the networks, the crew moved around the Convention floor with ease and speed. They came away with shrewd, sardonic portraits of the politicians, delegates and voters, providing an irreverent picture of the behind-the-scenes political maneuvering. TVTV's close coverage of the California delegation, as well as the successful battle to unseat Chicago mayor Richard Daley and his delegates, exemplifies the collective's verite methods.

The film looks beyond advertising as a medium that simply sells products, and beyond analyses of gender that focus on biological difference or issues of surface objectification and beauty, taking us into the two-tiered terrain of identity and power relations.

If the freedoms of speech and dissent are protected by the Bill  of Rights, to what degree should hate speech be included?  Conversely, if "political correctness" is intended to  counteract discrimination and intolerance, should it be used  as a vehicle of censorship?  Does PC heighten public awareness of marginalized groups or is it censorship designed to limit intellectual inquiry in the name of particular political agendas?  This film examines five controversial incidents at universities around the country involving conflicts of values and "political correctness".

In the 1930s, Hollywood studios enforced the Production Code, a set of guidelines for movie content, to answer growing charges of immorality.

<br><dt><b>The Bloggers: New Rules, or No Rules?</b><dd>
The rise of the blog as a form of serious news reporting means that conventional journalists must become familiar with the blog format and rethink typical journalistic approaches. This ABC News program examines the blogger "community," reviews major news stories that were broken by bloggers, and demonstrates ways in which blogging differs from traditional reporting methods. "60 Minutes" co-anchor Dan Rather resigned after a story he reported was refuted by bloggers, and sham White House press correspondent Jeff Gannon was exposed by bloggers. Featuring an interview with a Virginia schoolteacher who created a groundswell of political action with her blog, the video shows how the immediacy and the personal style of blog-writing can have powerful results - so powerful that journalistic accountability is now a contentious blog issue.
