<DD>An extraordinary BBC 11-part nature series. 40 camera teams were shooting at over 200 different locations all over the world for more than 5 years to get the pictures seen in the series. Each segment is followed by a sequence investigating the techniques and challenges of wildlife photography within that segment. Narrator, David Attenborough.  c2007. <B>DVD 7435</B>
<br>
<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><B>Disc 1: From Pole to Pole;  Mountains; Fresh Water.</B> From pole to pole: This introducton to the BBC television series looks at the planet as a whole and considers the key factors that have shaped its natural history. Without fresh water there is no life on land, while the sun dominates the lives of all animals and plants on earth and defines their habitats.  Mountains: This tour of Earth's mightiest mountain ranges, starting with the birth of a mountain at one of the lowest places on Earth and ending at the summit of Everest, takes in some of the most reclusive creatures on the planet and reveals the secrets of their survival.  Fresh water: This third episode follows the descent of rivers from their mountain sources to the sea and showcases the unique and dramatic wildlife found within Earth's lakes, wetlands and great rivers.





<br>
<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><B>Disc 2: Caves; Deserts; Ice Worlds.</b>  Caves: Deep in an undiscovered world, including both poisonous and flooded caves, we find astonishing crystals; cave angel fish, the five million bats of Deer Cave in Borneo; and troglodytes, and weird creatures like the Texas cave salamander, that never sees daylight or sets foot on the surface.  Deserts: 30% of Earth's land surface is desert which can seem empty and lifeless, yet they are the most varied of our planet's ecosystems. With remarkable footage this documentary unravels the secrets behind desert survival and for the first time on such a scale, reveals the ephemeral nature of this dynamic environment.
Ice worlds: The advance and retreat of polar ice is the real challenge to life. As the sea freezes in Antarctica all animals flee, except for the Emperor Penguin. Meanwhile, in the Arctic, humpback whales are feeding and the polar bear swims vast distances, stalking a colony of walruses.

<br>
<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><B>Disc 3: Great Plains; Jungles; 9; Shallow Seas.</b>
Great plains: On these immense wildernesses, from the baking savannahs of Africa to the frozen tundra of the Arctic, are found the greatest gatherings of wildlife on Earth: but close on the heels of gazelles, caribou or wildebeest come an array of plains predators --- eagles, wolves and lions.  Jungles: With little seasonality and a longer growing period, jungles are the most productive places on Earth, but surviving in the jungle is far from easy. Using state-of-the-art tracking shots and stunning aerials the film moves along the dark forest floor, up through the layers of vegetation and across the canopy.
Shallow seas: Follows a humpback whale mother and calf on an epic journey through the shallow seas of our planet. From tropical coral paradises, where the new-born calf takes his first breaths, to the storm-ravaged icy polar seas, the whales' great feeding grounds, are revealed as seas of great contrast and surprise.


<br>
<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><B>Disc 4:  Seasonal Forests; Ocean Deep.</B>
Seasonal forests: From the evergreen forest of the frozen North to the deciduous dry forests of the tropics, these woodlands illustrate the intense seasonality of the Earth. The tallest, largest and oldest organisms on the planet, they are home to a fascinating range of wildlife.  Ocean deep: Feast or famine: It's the governing principle of ocean life. From the sailfish, three-meter-long rapier-billed predators, and the exquisitely shelled Nautilus to the threatened blue whale, this journey into the most unexplored part of the planet reveals the extraordinary survivors of this immense and barren realm.

<br>
<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><B>Disc 5:   Saving Species; Into the Wilderness; Living Together.</b> Saving species: Many of the animals featured in the Planet Earth series are endangered so do we face an extinction crisis? Saving Species asks the experts if there really is a problem, looks at the reasons behind the declining numbers of particular animals and questions how we choose which species we want to conserve.
Into the wilderness: Pollution, climate change and a growing human population are all putting pressure on Earth's wildernesses including the Bialowieza forest, the Gobi Desert and the Arctic tundra. So how much of the planet is still wilderness? And why should we care? Into the Wilderness explores why these uninhabited expanses are important for our survival as well as that of all creatures on the planet.
Living together: This history of conservation throws up some interesting ideas as we look to the future of an ever more populated planet. How can conservation fit into this new world driven by economics and development? Living Together looks at the challenges facing conservation in the 21st century and looks at the role of religion in piloting a moral and ethical approach to the world we live in.

<dt><b>The Life in the Undergrowth</b><dd>In five filmed segments, David Attenborough explores the world of invertebrates, detailing aspects of life-cycles of numerous species around the world. 2005.  50 min. each installment. <B>DVD 7434</B>
<br>
<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><B>Invasion of the Land.</B> In this first segment Attenborough tells the story of the land-living invertebrates. He delves into the private life of Europe's dramatic leopard slug, a common garden resident with a truly bizarre end to its marathon mating ritual; watches the courtship ballet of tiny springtails on the underside of a leaf; sees swarms of bright red South African millipedes find partners, and in the caves of Venezuela meets the giant bat-eating centipede.
<br>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><B>Taking to the Air.</B> As the early June sun begins to set over a calm river in Central Hungary, masses of ghostly shapes emerge from their larval cases to take to the air for the first time. They are mayflies and in a spectacular display, thousands of them demonstrate how the very first wings were used. From the stunning aerobatics of hoverflies in an English garden to the mass migration of purple crow butterflies in the valleys of Taiwan, this episode tells the tale of the first animals ever to take to the air. Unique footage reveals the lightning fast reactions of bluebottles and hoverflies, filmed with one of the world's fastest cameras, and David Attenborough handles the world's largest (and perhaps most ferocious) insect - the Titan beetle.
<br>
<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><B>Silk Spinners.</B> Silk is the invertebrates' great invention, used in a range of ways from the protective stalks of lacewing eggs to the amazing hanging threads of New Zealand's 'glow worms'. Spiders, though, have taken silk-spinning to extremes. The common wolf spider has no web, but the female is a gentle parent, encasing her eggs in silk and carrying the precious bundle wherever she goes. The bolas spider uses a ball of sticky silk soaked in a copy of moth pheromone to lure its prey. Millions of communal spiders live and feed together in a vast, towering web - an arachnophobe's nightmare.
<br>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><B>Intimate Relations.</B> The world of invertebrates exists in a web of relationships with plants and other animals. Unique footage of the world's smallest insect, a fairy wasp, shows it flying underwater to find the eggs of water beetles in which to lay its own brood. Some ants 'farm' the trees that give them shelter, creating areas known as 'Devil's gardens'. To make sure these grow without competition, they kill off other seedlings in the surrounding vegetation. The blister beetle's larvae huddle together on the end of a piece of grass and mimic a female bee. When a male bee tries to mate with the 'female', the larvae grab on to his belly. When he eventually finds a female, the beetle larvae swap from his front on to her back, and get carried back to her nest where they eat her pollen supplies.
<br>
<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><B>Supersocieties.</B> Invertebrates don't always operate alone. True society was the last feature to evolve in invertebrates, as recently as the time of Tyrannosaurus. In the last program see the tensions below the surface in some of the great social structures built by insects, and witness the carnage when an ant colony and a termite colony wage war.

<br>




<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>The Primal Instinct.</b> Looks at the  remarkable variety of ways the sex urge is expressedamong the Earth's countless species. Some  species only need one sex while in others each member  is both sexes at once, while still others have been  reproducing for millennia with no sex at all. In some  species, a female devours her suitor after having sex,  in others a single female is attacked by a mob of  males. A fascinating look at the incredibly diverse  and sometimes strange ways of how life reproduces.  <B>Video/C 9149</B>

<br>
<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>A Time and a Place. </b>Explores how the sun,  moon, and seasons of nature profoundly influence courtship and mating. Males fight for  breeding rights; male weaver birds build a mansion of  twigs to entice a mate while humpback whales call to  females with a song. And from such behavior as the  body painting and ritualized dance of tribal cultures  to the fashion "look" of Western culture, insights are  offered into the mating signals exhibited by humans. <B>Video/C 9150</B>
<br>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>The Sex Contract. </b> Focuses on how  animals select partners and explores the duration of  that contact, which might last a moment or a  lifetime. Males fight, bully, charm and display to  establish dominance while wooing a female. Sea lions  battle for mating rights to a harem, while male  baboons have to win a female's affection before being  accepted. In Sierra Leone where land is plentiful,  Mende tribesmen have many wives, while in the land  poor Himalayas, many men share one wife.

<br>
<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>	Sex and the Human Animal . </b> The origins of  human sexuality are investigated by looking at other  social animals and the various ways in which  different cultures define sexual roles. Just as the  dazzling peacock's tail serves to attract a mate,  humans send sexual signals through gestures, power,  achievement, dress and make-up; all behaviors with its  antecedents in the lower forms of animal life.
<B>Video/C 9152</B>

<br>
<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>A Miracle in the Making. </b> Depicts the  diversity of ways animals mate, carry their young and give birth. When seahorses mate, it's the  father that has the babies; bats are born upside down  and the eggs a female crocodile lays in the sand could  become male or female, depending on the temperature of  the sand.
<B>Video/C 9153</B>
<br>
<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>The Young Ones. </b>  Presents the amazing  variety of nature's parenting systems. Human babies are born weak and helpless, requiring feeding,  nurturing and protecting, but not all babies get such  treatment. Squid parents abandon their offspring; when  food is in short supply, eagle parents allow their  largest chick to kill its siblings; some spider  mothers die leaving their bodies to provide food for  their newborns while elephant young continue to suckle  for five years while being raised by aunts, sisters  and brothers.
