<dt><b><a name="Bharat" id="Bharat">Bharat</a> ki chhap.</b></dt>
<dd>A film series on the history of science and technology on the Indian subcontinent from pre-history to the present. In Hindi with English subtitles. ca. 52 min. each installment.<br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Episode I: Introduction.</b> Introduces the reporters and shows them engaged in preparatory research with visits to such sites as the ancient Kanheri caves and Jaipur's stone observatory Jantar Mantar. Also presented are interviews with archeologists B. B. Lal, excavator of sites mentioned in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, M. K. Dhavalikar who discusses indications of drought 3,000 years ago, and D. P. Agrawal who shows the process of carbon dating. Video/C 8532<br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Episode II: The Stone Age till 3500 B.C.</b> This second episode examines contemporary tribal communities who continue to practice certain stone age techniques: The use of stone tools, the gathering of forest products and cave paintings which reflect a prehunting ritual. An encounter with the nomadic Gujjar tribe helps illustrate ancient techniques which are still viable while preparations for a wazwaan feast in a Kashmir village and the Navratri celebrations in Bombay also illustrate ancient rituals which still exist today. Video/C 8533<br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Episode III: The Harappan civilization, 3500 B.C. to 2000 B.C.</b> This third episode visits the Harappan civilazation. The discovery of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro altered the view that Indian history began with the Vedic age. The ruins at Lothal help recreate Harappan city planning and drainage systems, their crops and agricultural technology. Harappan overseas trade and navigational technology are discussed as well as their still undeciphered script. Visits are also made to Khetri, believed to be where the Harappans mined copper. Video/C 8534<br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Episode IV: Iron Age, 2000 B.C. to 500 B.C.</b> This fourth episode follows the social consequences of iron technology. The clearing of forests and improved agriculture with iron-tipped ploughs and spoked wheels laid the basis for new cities. This happened 1,000 years after the Harappan decline, in the basin of the Ganga. The megalithic culture, predominant in the South gives a more complete picture of the period. Bastar iron smelting today is almost identical to the megalithic technology. The city sites of Kaushambi and Rajgir are explored. The rise of brahminical orthodoxy is discussed, along with the geometry arising out of prescriptions for the construction of sacrificial altars. Video/C 8535<br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Episode V: The Age of Codification, 500 B.C. to 300 A.D.</b> This fifth episode opens with the grammarian Panini who attempted to systematise the rules of Bhasha, an early form of Sanskrit, a masterly achievement of logic, analysis and classification. At the site of Pondicherry, the trade with Rome is recalled. Cities and ports in the south developed during this period because of excellent irrigation systems: the simple etram, the temple tank and the Grand Anaicut on the Kaveri River. The Saraswati Mahal Library is a storehouse of many manuscripts first compiled during the period, which saw an almost universal condification of social, religious and philosophic thought, including the denial of basic rights to women and the lower castes. Video/C 8536<br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Episode VI: Ayurveda and Astronomy, 300 A.D. to 700 A.D.</b> This sixth episode introduces the basic principles of ayurveda, with reference to texts by Charaka and Sushruta which are remarkable not only for their pharmacopoeia and surgical knowledge, but also for their empirical-rational basis and scientific method. Next a visit is made to Kushana city sites at Sonkh, including a visit to the Mathura Museum. Concludes with a look at the work of Aryabhat and his achievements in mathematics and astronomy. Video/C 8537<br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Episode VII: Mathematics and Temple Architecture, 700 to 1200.</b> This seventh episode examines a strange paradox: India is ahead of many regions in scientific and technolgical knowledge but invariably an impasse is reached. Thus the mathematics of early Indian astronomers is taken up centuries later in Europe. Alchemy arises in India, China and West Asia but it is Europe that gives birth to modern chemistry. The social reasons for this phenomenon are examined. Looks at the development of mathematics, particularly the zero and the place value notation system using the ten numerals. The technology of zinc and bronze metallurgy is explored and then images and statues in worship in Hindu temples as architecture becomes Video/C 8538<br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Episode VIII: Synthesis and growth, 1200 to 1600.</b> This eighth episode describes society prior to the Turk and Afghan migrations. In the Sultanate period and later, feudalism became more deeply entranched, however the peasants and artisans were open to technological innovation. By the 16th century, the Portuguese founded their trading posts and missionaries carried out botanical studies and introduced the printing press. In the South there flourished the kingdom of Vijayanagar. Under Akbar the emerging cultural synthesis reached new heights with an explosion of exquisite crafts. The nobility encouraged horticulture and introduced many exotic fruits, even as India became renowned for its textiles. Video/C 8539<br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Episode IX: Stagnation and a changing world, 1600 to 1800.</b> This ninth episode opens with the Bhakti and Sufi movements which were gathering force as the Mughal empire dissolved into small kingdoms. The Renaissance in Europe travelled to India but left to individual noblemen, never acquired the dimensions of a social force. Meanwhile Indian-built ships were much in demand by the Europeans and Jaisingh was building the city of Jaipur. He reformed the calendar and built a number of astronomical observatories. Tipu Sultan of Mysore had a more integrated approach to social and technological change. He attempted to acquire the latest military technology, but with his defeat, a major threat to colonialism was removed. Video/C 8540<br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Episode X: Colonialism and the Industrial Revolution, 1800 to 1900.</b> This tenth episode opens with an examination of the battle of Plassey in 1757 and the ascendance of the British in India. Craft centers decayed as British-made goods flooded Indian markets and even the thriving steel industry in Telengana was affected. The East India Company conducted surveys of natural resources, leading to the development of raw material processing industries and the encouragement of crops useful to British industry. The railways were developed, helping to consolidate Britain's hold. The consequent discontent culminated with the 1857 war of independence. Yet the exposure to new ideas from the West had brought about a fresh awareness. The efforts of social reformers and educationists such as Ram Mohan Roy and Mahendra Lal Sircar are discussed.Video/C 8541<br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Episode XI: The Freedom Struggle and the Scientific Community, 1900 to 1947.</b>This eleventh episode opens with India's freedom struggle at the start of the 20th century. The spread of education contributed to the growing national movement. The work of scientists such as J. C. Bose, P. C. Ray, Meghnad Saha and C. V. Raman is discussed in this context. These early scientists had a vision of a free India and many served on the Panning Committee founded by the Indian National Congress in 1938. Meanwhile, the plunder of India's natural resources continued and the story of coal is a typical example. Indian geologists and engineers came together against all odds, and demonstrated that Indian coal could be enriched by a washing process. Video/C 8542<br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Episode XII: Independent India, 1947 to the Present.</b> This twelfth episode looks at the challenges after India gained its independence and the role of the scientific community in regeneration of the country. The "green revoution," often cited as an example of successful food production, is explored through interviews with farmers, an agricultural scientist and an economist. The proposed system of dams on the Narmada River and its ecological and social consequences is examined. The application of new technolgies has shown results, yet often the benefits are inequitable which points to the need for greater community participation in the development process. A recent example of people's involvement is the Baliraja Dam in Maharashtra, where people have formed a water users cooperative. Video/C 8543<br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"><b>Episode XIII: Retrospect and Prospect.</b> This final episode looks at the promise of technology for the future of India. It visits some villages in Udaipur where a voluntary organisation is training local people for afforestation programs. Then to Hoshangabad, where an experiment in teaching science in the field is under way. In Meerut, scene of repeated political disturbances, the circumstances behind such outbursts are analyzed. The mass media also has a responsiblity. P.C Joshi speaks of the gap between the original vision and the present reality of television. The film concludes with filmmakers visiting Prof. Yash Pal, who guided the making of this series with a conversation full of hope for the future of India. Video/C 8544<br></dd>
