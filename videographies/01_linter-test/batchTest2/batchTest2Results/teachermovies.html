<dt><b>The Children's Hour.</b> (1961)</dt>
<dd>Directed by William Wyler. Cast: Audrey Hepburn, Shirley MacLaine, James Garner, Miriam Hopkins, Fay Bainter, Karen Balkin. When a vindictive little girl is disciplined in an exclusive girl's school, the child twists an overheard comment into slander. She accuses her teachers of lesbianism--and her gullible grandmother spreads the gossip. Outraged, Karen and Martha fight back in court, but a child's lie is hard to disprove. Wyler's earlier screen adaptation of Hellman's play (<i><a href="#thesethree">These Three</a></i>, 1936) skirted the issue of lesbianism completely by making the central "problem" an adulterous heterosexual love triange in which one teacher is accused of being in love with her best friend's fiance. From the play by Lillian Hellman.

Cast: Hilary Swank, Patrick Dempsey, Scott Glenn, Imelda Staunton, April Lee Hernandez, Mario, Kristin Herrera, Jacklyn Ngan, Sergio Montalvo, Jason Finn, Deance Wyatt, Vanetta Smith, Gabriel Chavarria, Hunter Parrish. Dramatization of a true story about a teacher in a racially divided school who gives her students what they've always needed, a voice. Erin Gruwell comes to a southern California high school bubbling over with naive optimism. She quickly discovers that her unruly classroom is not easily won over by her good intentions. After a few floundering attempts to connect with her students, Gruwell gives them the assignment of keeping journals about their own lives.

Draws heavily from the published journals of the real students themselves. Special features: Feature-length commentary by director Richard LaGravenese and actor Hilary Swank; deleted scenes; featurettes; theatrical trailer; photo gallery. Based on the book "The Freedom Writers diary: how a teacher and 150 teens used writing to change themselves and the world around them" by the Freedom Writers and Erin Gruwell (MOFF: HQ796 .F76355 1999). 122 min. <b>DVD 7635</b></dd>
