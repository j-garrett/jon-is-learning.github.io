What follows is a chapter on survival as the English language weathers Viking and Norman invasions, vying with and eventually absorbing rival tongues. Lively settings such as village pubs and markets bring home the lasting influence of Anglo-Saxon, Old Norse, and Old French.

<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>My New Family</b> In this film the story of the childhood and education of Laurent Clerc, a pioneer of deaf education, is described. When he was twelve, after being deprived of the opportunity to attend school, he went with his uncle on a week long journey to the National Institute for Deaf-Mutes in Paris. It was here that Laurent Clerc spent the next twenty years and met a young deaf man, Jean Massieu. "I knew that I would learn this new deaf language and that these people, this society of the deaf, would become my new family. 36 min. Video/C 3130<br>
<br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>The Shepherd and the Symbol.</b> This film examines the life and work of Jean Massieu. Describes Massieu's frustrated pleas to his father to be allowed to attend school, the kindness of a stranger that lead to his early education in Bordeau under the abbe Sicard and several dramatic examples of Massieu's decades-long friendship with and loyalty to the abbe Sicard. Jean Massieu was not only a friend and mentor of Laurent Clerc, but he was also "the first deaf teacher ever and a symbol worldwide of what a deaf man could achieve through education." 29 min. Video/C 3131<br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>High Theater.</b> This film tells the story of Abbe Roch-Ambroise Sicard, the teacher of Jean Massieu. As the successor to the Abbe de l'Epee, Sicard, along with Massieu, presented a petition to the French National Assembly and obtained a permanent home for the school--Saint-Jacques. Sicard eagerly continued the tradition of public demonstrations and exhibits started by the Abbe de l'Epee. In 1815 Sicard undertook a demonstration tour to London with Massieu, Clerc, and another students. According to Clerc "thus it was that I first came to meet Rev. Thomas Gallaudet." 33 min.

<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>The Secret.</b> This film concerns the history of the false education of deaf people. Focus is upon oralism, the concept that the only proper route for educating deaf students is oral instruction. A central figure in the oralist controversy is Jacob Rodrigue Pereire. He claimed to have a secret method for teaching deaf children to speak. This episode is "a record of the efforts of hearing people to supplant the language of the deaf with their language, to replace signs with speech." 33 min. Video/C 3134<br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>A Tale Based on Fact.</b> This film focuses on Abbe de L'Epee, and the beginning of world wide education for deaf people. The chance encounter between Abbe de L'Epee and two deaf sisters launched him on his career with deaf students and inspired the abbe to begin his school. What is remarkable is that this occurred in an age when the majority view was that deaf people had no abstract ideas, no memory and, of course, no language. "Fortunately, Eppe's independence of spirit kept him from adopting the prevailing views uncritically." 28 min. Video/C 3133<br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>Success and Failure.</b> This film centers around two men, Jean-Marc Itard and Baron Joseph Marie De Gerando, who expended great time and energy in futile efforts to transform deaf students into pseudo-hearing students. There were, fortunately, outspoken critics of these efforts...men such as Ferdinand Berthier and Roch-Ambroise Bebian. In the end, both Itard and De Gerando learned the lessons of their failed experiments. 40 min. Video/C 3135<br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>Fortune and Misfortune.</b> This film centers on events that lead to the founding of education for deaf students in the United States. Thomas Gallaudet, encouraged by Mason Cogswell to learn the European methods of educating deaf students, enrolls at Saint-Jacques. It is here that Gallaudet convinces Laurent Clerc to accompany him to Hartford to assist in founding a school for the deaf in the United States. "You will be a living proof that what has been believed impossible--the education of those born deaf--is indeed possible." 30 min. Video/C 3136<br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>Spreading the Word.</b>This film centers around the efforts of Gallaudet and Clerc to establish the American Asylum, recruit students and seek funding for the school and its programs. These efforts involved extensive travel and public lectures not only to solicit funds but also to recruit students so the school would flourish. Within a dozen years of its founding the school was receiving students from half the states in the Union. "This assembly of much of the deaf youth of America in one place was one of the main forces that created a true society of the deaf with a single language serving to bind them together." 24 min. Video/C 3137<br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>Concerning Women.</b> In this film four women who made significant contributions to the education of the deaf are discussed: Alice Cogswell, Julia Brace, Eliza Boardman Clerc, and Sophia Fowler Gallaudet. Alice Cogswell was the deaf daughter of Mason Cogswell, and the source of the motivation of this pioneer educator; Julia Brace was the first educated deaf-blind person in America; Eliza Boardman, a student at the American Asylum, married Laurent Clerc, in what was the first deaf marriage in America; Sophia Fowler was the fourteen student to enter the school and eventually married Thomas Gallaudet. Their fourth son became president of the National Deaf-Mute College in Washington, D.C. 19 min. Video/C 3138<br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>A Dangerous Incursion.</b> Describes attempts to eradicate and eliminate the language and society of the deaf that had been nurtured at the American Asylum in Hartford. Horace Mann and Samuel Gridley Howe, self-proclaimed social reformers, squandered time, effort and money on the surface appearance of oral language rather than on the true bedrock of intellectual development. "Powerful hearing people want to replace our language, to educate us in a foreign tongue, to disperse our gatherings, to ban our marriages." 18 min. Video/C 3139<br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>The Denial.</b> This film centers upon the opposed viewpoints concerning signed and oral languages between Alexander Graham Bell and Laurent Clerc. Bell was a firm believer in oralism while Clerc favored a deaf community and sign language. Clerc believed that the overriding purpose of education was personal fulfillment, while for Bell it was integration of deaf persons with the hearing majority. 37 min. Video/C 3140<br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>The Incurable Deafness.</b> This final film of the series is reported from the perspective of Harlan Lane concerning his views on the current situation for deaf persons. He believes that the congress held by the Pereire Society in 1880 in Milan was "the single most critical event which released a tidal wave or oralism which resulted in the submersion of sign language and signing communities. He feels the dominance of oralism and the supression of signing have resulted in the limited educational achievement of today's deaf men and women, 80% of whom, in America, are engaged in manual or unskilled labor." 24 min.
