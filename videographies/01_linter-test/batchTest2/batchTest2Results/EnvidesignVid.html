<dd>This program looks at the design and structural strength of Q1 Tower (Queensland Number One) and how it has affected the environment of Surfer's Paradise, once a trendy haven for beach bums. Looks at the imposing structure from more than one angle, studying its extraordinary design elements while asking: how has its pristine environment been affected? Viewers will learn about Q1's massive exterior canopy, its honeycomb core that reduces weight while maintaining structural strength, and the system of 26 supporting piles that had to be buried in the sandy soil beneath the tower. <b>DVD X3042</b><br></dd>

<dd>One of the strongest buildings on the planet, Torre Mayor is constructed to withstand seismic movement that would obliterate the average skyscraper. Built in the wake of Mexico City's devastating 1985 earthquake, the tower is both a monument to engineering and a haven of safety in one of the world's most active seismic zones. This program focuses on the safety solutions behind Torre Mayor's innovative design. Viewers are introduced to its double-triangle diamond pattern, an ultra-solid combination of bracing and dampers, and the building's concrete-encased steel columns -- all resulting in a tower that does not sway significantly during a quake. <b>DVD X3043</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Cira Centre, Philadelphia</b></dd>
<dd>It is an increasingly common scenario: a developer wants to build a tower in a depressed urban area, and must fill half the building before permits are issued. What's the ace in the hole? A superstar architect who brings media attention to the project. This program recounts such a story, in which Petronas Towers and Canary Wharf creator Cesar Pelli waved his magic design wand over the Cira Center project, making it stand apart from other Philadelphia high-rises. In addition to the building's design features, the program reflects on the question: are celebrity architects over-hyped and overpaid, and what--if any--public benefits exist to offset their staggering paychecks? <b>DVD X3044</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Cologne Cathedral</b></dd>

This program examines the design, construction, and history of Cologne Cathedral--which, for a grand total of four years, was the tallest building in the world. Dr. Barbara Schock-Werner, the cathedral's resident chief architect, describes political and cultural conditions during Cologne's initial building years and guides viewers through the evolution of the colossal church. Dr. Ulrike Brinkmann, in charge of the cathedral's acres of stained glass, sheds light on the religious meanings and architectural significance of the myriad colored windows. <b>DVD X3045</b><br></dd>

As this program describes, the developers undertook a billion-dollar gamble by creating an international financial center, symbolized by this obelisk-shaped tower, in the city's East End docklands. Viewers will learn about the complicated political and economic cooperation that had to occur before building could begin. The collapse of the global property market following completion of the complex--resulting in bankruptcy for the developers and darkness for a large section of the tower--is another major subject. <b>DVD X3046</b><br></dd>

<dd>What happens when a city loses its trademark industry and the trademark architectural icon that goes with it? That was the problem facing the Swedish shipbuilding city of Malmo when the Kockums Crane was dismantled in 2002. This program illustrates the city's radical solution--a dramatic reinvention of its skyline and its socioeconomic image with the Turning Torso apartment building. Viewers will learn about the tower's unique sculptural origins, its twisted cube-stack shape, its unusual slanted windows, and its role in creating Malmo's post-industrial identity. The civic controversy that frequently accompanies daring building design is also explored. <b>DVD X3048</b><br></dd>

This episode profiles 7 World Trade Center, the first building to be constructed on Ground Zero. Viewers will encounter the structure's surprising shape-a result of changes in its downtown environment-and discover how the building has taken occupant safety to new levels with a thickened concrete core, stairwells 50 percent wider than code requirements, and a lobby with a blast-resistant glass facade. <b>DVD X3128</b><br></dd>

<dd>In recent years, Havana has become famous all over the world for the morbid charm of its flaking facades. But these ruins are far less poetic for the people who inhabit them. Houses frequently collapse causing fatalities. This unique documentary tells the stories of the people who reside in these modern ruins, from a homeless man who lives in an abandoned theater, to an expropriated landowner who struggles against the decay of his parental home, to a writer who conceives a philosophy of the ruins to explain the gradual collapse of the city and its political system. A mixture of private history, memories, fears and hopes for the future, this documentary explores the quixotic relationship between man and architecture, man and ruins (commenting along the way on the ruin-tourism that has developed in Cuba). Spanning the entire history of Cuban architecture, from the colonial era up through the socialist revolution, this film captures the final moments of these historic buildings before they're renovated -- or simply collapse altogether.
