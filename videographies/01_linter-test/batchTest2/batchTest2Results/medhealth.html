<dt><b>Body Corporate: Who Owns Your Genes?</b></dt>
<dd>Right now across the globe there is a major legal and scientific battle raging over one simple question: should we allow individuals and corporations to patent genes? Some biotech companies say yes, claiming patents reward medical research and promote the investigation of life saving treatments. Others see it very differently, describing patenting as a biotech land-grab that's less about patients and more about greed. Reporter Andrew Fowler travels to the United States and around Australia to hear from both sides in this high-stakes battle. He talks to the researchers, patent lawyers and families who have been forced to pay significant amounts of money to find out if they have genes linked to potentially life-threatening conditions. Who is right? Can the very basis of life itself be patented and sold? Is it possible that a unique gene that makes us what we are could be patented by someone we don't know and then franchised out to a major corporation?

<dt><b>The Medicated Child</b></dt>
<dd>Ten years ago, stimulants like Ritalin and Adderall were the drugs of choice to treat behavioral issues in children. Today, children as young as four years old, are being prescribed more powerful anti-psychotic medications that are much less understood. The drugs can cause serious side effects and virtually nothing is known about their long-term impact. The increase in the use of anti-psychotics is directly tied to the rising incidence of one particular diagnosis, bipolar disorder. Experts estimate that the number of kids with the diagnosis is now over a million and rising. Written, produced and directed by Marcela Gaviria.

As the economy continues to spiral downward, the new administration promises to deliver comprehensive health care reform. Investigates the failures and future of the private insurance industry, examing the best and worst of U.S. healthcare by telling the gripping and sometimes tragic stories of ordinary Americans.

<dt><b>Sick Around the World</b></dt>
<dd>Four in five Americans say the U.S. health-care system needs 'fundamental' change. Can the U.S. learn anything from the rest of the world about how to run a health-care system, or are these nations so culturally different from us that their solutions would simply not be acceptable to Americans? FRONTLINE correspondent T.R. Reid examines first-hand how other advanced capitalist democracies - the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, Taiwan and Switzerland - deliver healthcare, and what the United States might learn from their successes and failures. Contents: 1. Great Britain: a leader in preventive medicine -- 2. Japan: universal coverage, no gatekeepers -- 3. Germany: a popular largely market-based system -- 4. Taiwan: a new system they copied from others -- 5. Switzerland: its former system resembled ours. Produced and directed by Jon Palfreman.

<dt><b>The Great Health Service Swindle.</b>(Life; 5)</dt>
<dd>Explores why Ghanaian nurses have been leaving their country to work abroad, and what this "brain drain" means for the Ghanaian health care system. One widely quoted source says almost two thousand nurses left the country between 1995 and 2002. The exodus is set to continue as nurses opt to leave a crumbling health system to earn more abroad. In the UK, some nurses can earn more in a day than they could in a month back home. Spending on health in Ghana has gone up but its value has declined because of inflation. While most of that money goes to wages, patients have to pay because the health service operates on a "user pays" principle, the so-called "cash and carry" system. The stresses of this system is one reason health workers leave. Filmed &amp; directed by Kim Hopkins. 2005. 26 min. <b>DVD 8389</b><br>

<dt><b>Rothstein's First Assignment: A Story About Documentary Truth</b></dt>
<dd>Reviews the work of FSA photographer Arthur Rothstein, retracing his steps by interviewing descendants of the mountain people he photographed during the depression, weaving them together with a 1964 audio interview of Rothstein, archival newsreel footage, and clips from the documentary "Hollow Folk." During the course of his research, Robinson discovered evidence that Rothstein's images were not pure documentation. Instead, they were often staged for the camera. Digging beneath the official story, the film unearths an unsettling link between propaganda and documentary, and raises troubling questions about the photographer's complicity in the displacement of thousands of people for "progress." The most chilling discovery, though, is the forced institutionalization and sterilization of mountain residents as part of a eugenics program where over 8,000 individuals were sterilized. This fascinating film challenges the viewer to consider the complexity behind images that are viewed as historical truth. Written and directed by Richard Knox Robinson.
