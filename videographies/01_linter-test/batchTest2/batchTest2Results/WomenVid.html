From a personal encounter with a family trying to raise their sons and daughter with identical influences to a series of observational experiments with a group of four to seven year olds, this film explores the social, physiological, neurological and genetic aspects of stereotypical sex typed behavior. <b>Video/C 6371</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>Part 2, The Brain at Work.</b> A generation of equal opportunities has failed to iron out the great sex divide in the workplace. This film examines primarily through research on the brain, how biology plays a role in men's drive to succeed more than it does for women, and why this may explain the lack of women in the boardroom. Also looks at the contrasting behaviors of female and male athletes and the difference of "risk taking" behavior between the sexes. <b>Video/C 6372</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>Part 3, The Emotional Difference.</b> The era of equal opportunities raised expectations that men and women's roles would become interchangeable. Yet, research reveals that most men are neurologically primed to find household routine more difficult, and that women are hormonally primed for maternal behavior, finding such tasks less stressful than men do. This film explores the neurological elements that help to perpetuate persistent divisions of labor, and investigates the biological basis of our seemingly unchangeable emotional systems. <b>Video/C 6373</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>I Lease Wombs, I Don't Sell Babies: An Inquiry Into "Surrogate Motherhood"</b></dt>
<dd>Since it burst onto the public agenda in the 1980s, "surrogate" motherhood has aroused controversy and confusion. This powerful courtroom drama explores the ethical, emotional, and commercial issues underlying the practice of surrogacy and depicts its effects on three participants: the "biological" mother, who becomes pregnant through artificial insemination, the father, and his wife. In setting the issue of "surrogate" motherhood in the context of individual lives, this well-acted video relates a story that is seldom told and reveals the human side of this controversial practice. The courtroom drama is based on actual testimony. Four witnesses, each a party to a preconception agreement, are called to testify: the husband and wife who are having trouble conceiving a child, the broker who sets up the deal, and finally the "surrogate" mother, who has relinquished her baby to the father and his wife for $10,000, which translates to an hourly rate of less than the minimum wage. This is a drama that should be seen by everyone considering "surrogate" parenthood arrangements as well as by professionals in the family planning and counseling fields. The issues it raises force us to examine what it means to society when motherhood is turned into a commercial activity and the values of the marketplace take priority over the interests of women and their children. 1992. 46 min. <b>Video/C MM540</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>Codes of Gender</b></dt>
<dd>Communication scholar Sut Jhally applies the late sociologist Erving Goffman's groundbreaking analysis of advertising to the contemporary commercial landscape in this provocative new film about gender as a ritualized commercial performance.

The film looks beyond advertising as a medium that simply sells products, and beyond analyses of gender that focus on biological difference or issues of surface objectification and beauty, taking us into the two-tiered terrain of identity and power relations.

<dt><b>Killing Us Softly 4</b></dt>
<dd>In this new, highly anticipated update of her pioneering Killing us softly series, Jean Kilbourne takes a fresh look at how advertising traffics in distorted and destructive ideals of femininity. The film marshals a range of new print and television advertisements to lay bare a stunning pattern of damaging gender stereotypes--images and messages that too often reinforce unrealistic, and unhealthy, perceptions of beauty, perfection, and sexuality. By bringing Kilbourne's groundbreaking analysis up to date, Killing us softly 4 stands to challenge a new generation to take advertising seriously, and to think critically about popular culture and its relationship to sexism, eating disorders, and gender violence. Contents: Introduction -- Ads everywhere -- A constructed beauty -- Objectification -- Judged by looks alone -- Thinness -- Dieting -- Eating &amp; morality -- Global impact -- Infantilization &amp; powerlessness -- Advertising &amp; sex -- Experienced virgins -- Consumerism &amp; sexualizing products -- Masculinity -- Violence -- What to do?

<dd>Extreme body consciousness has taken youthful narcissism to new heights, making 'boy meets girl' a ruthless physical selection process.

Beginning with the pressure that men currently feel to conform to an abstract physical ideal, the role of the media is scrutinized, along with the culture that from Munich to Los Angeles excludes all who do not espouse the ideals of bodily perfection at the expense of all else. 30 min. <b>Video/C 9679</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>The Vagina Monologues</b></dt>
<dd>"I was worried about vaginas. I was worried about what we think about vaginas, and even more worried that we don?tthink about them. So I decided to talk to women about their vaginas, to do vagina interviews, which becamevagina monologues. I talkedwith hundreds of women. I talked to old women, young women, married women, single women, lesbians, college professors, actors, corporate professionals, sex workers, African American women, Hispanic women, Asian American Women, Native American women, Caucasian women, Jewish women. At first, women were reluctant to talk. They were a little shy. But once they got going, you couldn?t stop them."

<dt><b>In the Name of the Family</b></dt>
<dd>On December 10, 2007, a 16-year-old schoolgirl, Aqsa Parvez, was strangled to death, and her father and brother are charged with her murder. Three weeks later, teenage sisters, Amina and Sarah Said, were shot to death in Dallas; their father fled the country and is still wanted for murder. Six months later a 19-year-old college student was stabbed by her brother; he was convicted and is now in jail in New York. Friends and family of the murdered girls paint a chilling portrait of the forces that led to their deaths, and Toronto schoolgirls talk about their lives of constant fear. While Muslim women organize to help girls at risk and the Imam at a Toronto mosque teaches that violence has no basis in Islam, some men continue to justify these crimes through patriarchal beliefs about family honour. This documentary challenges the traditions that lie behind the heartbreaking tragedies committed against young girls caught between two cultures in North America. Directed, written and produced by Shelley Saywell. 2010. 60 min. <b>DVD X7108</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>Phantom of the Operator.</b></dt>
<dd>This delightful found-footage film reveals a little-known chapter in labor history: the story of female telephone operators' central place in the development of global communications. Presents more than one hundred clips from rarely seen industrial, advertising and scientific management films produced in North America between 1903 and 1989 by Bell and Western Electric, transformed into a dreamlike montage documentary. As the first agents of globalization, this invisible army of women offered a way for companies to feminize and glamorize what was a highly stressful, underpaid and difficult job. Not merely 'Voices with a Smile,' telephone operators were test pilots for new management systems, and the face of shrewd public relations campaigns. As the work of operators has been eclipsed by the advent of automated systems, this artful piece of labor history also offers an insightful comment on women's work, industrialization and communications technology.

<dt><b>Type/caste: A Secretary with a Camera</b></dt>
<dd>Although the early 20th century "working girl" epitomized independence and modernity, by the end of the century the "secretary" had become the symbol of female subservience. This innovative documentary was shot and edited over a period of several years by a secretary working in downtown San Francisco. Loosely structured as a "day in the life" of a secretary, the film is a funny and compelling look inside the traditional female role in the American workplace. The film effectively interweaves narration, information on the history of clerical workers in the United States, interviews, the voices of secretaries, and provocative music, poetry, and performance to create a multilayered and highly discussible filmic essay that will stimulate thought and debate in a wide variety of courses in women's studies, labor studies, sociology, psychology, and American studies.

The pageant is created by the workers and their trade union to bring their families together for an evening of solidarity and fun. Set against the preparation for the 2003 pageant, this film explores the lives of working women and celebrates them as creators of beauty. Although the end of apartheid has not taken away the drudgery of repetitive factory labor, this pageant shows working class women inventing their own lively folk culture. A film by Jane Kennedy. 2004. 58 min. <b>DVD 5264</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>Hot Wax</b> (Real stories from a free South Africa; v. 1)</dt>
<dd>Ivy is a big, bubbly black woman who managed to run her own beauty salon surreptitiously during the dark days of apartheid. She lives in Alexandra, a restless and poor township, while her white, mostly elderly, clients live in the tree-lined suburbs of Johannesburg. In her salon she is part beautician, long-time friend, lay counselor and honest commentator to her customers. While she masks her clients' imperfections, she also peels away layers of difference separating the races. It can be easily pointed out that Ivy essentially enjoys the intimacy of a domestic servant, while her white clients maintain their economic privileges and know little about Ivy's private world. But since apartheid's end, Ivy owns her own shop and now meets her clients on an equal footing. A film by Andy Spitz. 2004. 49 min. <b>DVD 5263</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>Kiyoko's Situation</b></dt>
<dd>Kiyoko's situation articulates the deeply embedded cultural roles of Japanese women through the parallel stories of two female artists, Kiyoko and Tani. In Idemitsu's narrative-within-a-narrative, "Kiyoko's situation" is played out on a television monitor within Tani's drama. Tani is paralyzed in her attempts to paint by her feeling that, as a single woman, she has failed in society's eyes. Kiyoko, a young mother viciously criticized by her husband and family for her fierce determination to paint, eventually compromises her art for "maternal duty." As Kiyoko complies with the family, Tani, isolated and despairing, is driven to suicide. Idemitsu's chillingly omniscient television monitor, which acts as the psychological "other," metaphorically and literally condemns Tani to death. In the final cruel irony, she hangs herself, using the television monitor as a jumping-off point.

<dt><b>Hajj: Drinking from the Stream.</b></dt>
<dd>A film by Claire Dannenbaum. "Hajj is an experimental ethnography looking at acts of resistence and empowerment in the everyday life of Turkish and Kurdish women. This project explores the notion of performance in everyday life--forms of activity which would otherwise be censurable, dangerous, or threatening--in the context of a gender-segregated and patriarchal culture. While Hajj is not an anthropological film per se, it attempts to counter mainstream ethnographic preoccupation with esoteric or ritual activity (special occasions and "public: culture typically carried out by/for men) by looking at "non-events," or the performative elements in women's domestic tasks. Using footage of village life and women at work, the film addresses the multiple meanings behind women's domestic labor, and the potential social power derived from the marginalized activity of home."

<dt><b>The Pupil of Her Hand, In the Palm of Her Eye.</b></dt>
<dd>A film by Claire Dannenbaum. "A visual exploration of an invisible phenomenon, The Pupil of Her Hand In the Palm of Her Eye maps the cross-cultural and personal journey of the filmmaker's search for an elusive subject, the evil eye. Using footage shot in Morocco, the film traces the irony of looking, gazing and glancing in Moroccan women's culture, where such actions are heavily coded and controlled. Ultimately, an evocation of references that lead to and hover about the evil eye, the film suggests the inherent complexity of ethnographic documents portraying another culture."

<dt><b>Kumari: Living Goddess of Nepal</b></dt>
<dd>In Nepal an ancient tradition survives to this day : young girls are chosen to become goddesses and taken away from their families to live in a temple where people come to worship them and pray for good fortune. In a country where girls are seen as second class citizens, the worshipping of a girl child could be seen as a positive role model, but some are adamant that the tradition should be stopped as the young girls miss out on their family and school life and suffer serious psychological problems as a result. This film looks at the life of three young goddesses and explores the debates for and against this unique tradition. A film by Tassia Kobylinska. c2005. 27 min. <b>DVD X4230</b><br></dd>
<dt><b>The Long-haired Warriors</b></dt>
<dd>Vietnamese women have a long and legendary tradition of fierce warriorship -- a tradition exemplified in recent history by their wholehearted participation in the struggles against the French, the South Vietnamese Regular Army, and the American military. Ultimately, they shared in all those victories, but none came without painful losses and sorrows. This provocative documentary introduces a number of Vietnamese women who were active in the National Liberation Front, or Viet Cong, and shows how their wartime experiences shaped the rest of their lives. A highlight of the film is an emotional visit with four former prisoners to the infamous Con Dao prison camp where, from 1968 to 1975, they were among 600 women -- some as young as 15 years old -- kept in "tiger cages" and subjected to frequent torture and abuse by the American-supported South Vietnamese military forces. From disparate perspectives, these women universally express the conviction that their stories can provide a common thread of compassion to bind the wounds that divide people in the U.S. and Vietnam. They feel a bond with American wives and mothers who have also suffered profound losses. This engaging film examines the lives of some of America's former enemies and illuminates some surprising parallels and contrasts between their world and the world of the American filmmaker who seeks to discover their stories. It will stimulate discussion in a variety of courses in women's studies, Asian studies, and history. Produced by Mel Halbach. 1998. 60 min. <b>Video/C MM549</b><br></dd>
<dt><b>The Love Market</b></dt>
<dd>In the highlands of North Vietnam lies the remote town of Sapa, home to a mosaic of colorful hill tribes. Sapa opened to tourism in the late 1990's and now roughly 200 hill tribe girls aged 7-18 years live independently on the streets of Sapa selling embroidery.

<dt><b>Dying to Leave</b></dt>
<dd>Explores the current worldwide boom in illicit migration. Every year, an estimated two to four million people are shipped in containers, shepherded through sewage pipes, secreted in car chassis, and ferried across frigid waters.

By listening to the voices of those who pulled up their roots, who risked all, this documentary puts a human face on what might otherwise be seen as statistical, overwhelming and remote. Focusing on five major stories whose journeys traverse 16 countries from Colombia to China, from Mexico to Moldova this film looks into the circumstances that drove these migrants from their homes, describes the difficulties involved in their epic journeys and reveals what awaits them in their new world.

But when the Gutu sisters left their home in Moldova they were actually traveling into a nightmare-- not the health aide employment that their "friends" had promised, but rather enslavement as prostitutes. This program follows their story by recording their own painful accounts, a different side of the narrative as told by the mother-daughter pair who led them into deception, and the real-life courtroom drama that unfolds when the sisters bring charges against their former neighbors.

Gender issues and stratification, the gender divide in the workplace, the impact of Title Seven, and the women's movement are explored in this lesson.

<dt><b>Why Men Don't Iron.</b> Three-part series, 52 minutes each, 1998.<br></dt>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>Part 1, Learning the Difference.</b> This film reveals groundbreaking studies, both practical and scientific, that illustrate the variances between the learning patterns of boys and girls from birth to adolescence. From a personal encounter with a family trying to raise their sons and daughter with identical influences to a series of observational experiments with a group of four to seven year olds, this film explores the social, physiological, neurological and genetic aspects of stereotypical sex typed behavior. <b>Video/C 6371</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>Part 2, The Brain at Work.</b> A generation of equal opportunities has failed to iron out the great sex divide in the workplace. This film examines primarily through research on the brain, how biology plays a role in men's drive to succeed more than it does for women, and why this may explain the lack of women in the boardroom. Also looks at the contrasting behaviors of female and male athletes and the difference of "risk taking" behavior between the sexes. <b>Video/C 6372</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>Part 3, The Emotional Difference.</b> The era of equal opportunities raised expectations that men and women's roles would become interchangeable. Yet, research reveals that most men are neurologically primed to find household routine more difficult, and that women are hormonally primed for maternal behavior, finding such tasks less stressful than men do. This film explores the neurological elements that help to perpetuate persistent divisions of labor, and investigates the biological basis of our seemingly unchangeable emotional systems. <b>Video/C 6373</b><br></dd>
