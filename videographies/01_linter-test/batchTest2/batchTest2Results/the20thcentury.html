<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Part 1: Seeds of Change.</b> This program examines daily life in America during the early 1900s--when a loaf of bread cost only a few cents, horse-power really meant horsepower, flying to the moon was the stuff of dreams and the average life span was only 45 years--while looking ahead to the decades of changes yet to come. 46 min. <b>Video/C 6354</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Part 2: 1914-1919: Shell Shock.</b> The psychological damage inflicted by the bombardments of World War I was called shell shock, a term that aptly described the feelings of the World War I world. This program illustrates America's reluctant emergence as a world power and analyzes the social impact of the wholesale loss of life, of husbands and fathers and of sacred ideals such as honor, patriotism and glory that sprang from "the war to end all wars." 45 min. <b>Video/C 6355</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Part 3: 1920-1929: Boom to Bust.</b> In the aftermath of World War I, many modern-minded Americans, particularly women, were eager to do away with outdated traditions and claim new rights and freedoms. This program investigates the culture of the roaring twenties--women's suffrage, prohibition, the exploration of the Antarctic, the Scopes trial, the establishment of the Ku Klux Klan, the new music called "Jazz", technological innovations and finally the stock market crash and the subsequent economic depression. 45 min. <b>Video/C 6356</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Part 4: 1929-1936: Stormy Weather.</b> America--a nation that claimed ever-increasing wealth as its birthright--was rudely awakened by the Great Depression, which caused 25% unemployment, the closing of 9,000 banks, and the loss of $2.5 billion in deposits. This program captures a people's struggle as they faced the collapse of prosperity and diminished hopes of being able to experience the American Dream. 45 min. <b>Video/C 6357</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Part 5: 1936-1941: Over the Edge.</b> Safely watching Europe from across the Atlantic Ocean, many Americans observed the messianic popularity of Hitler and Mussolini and the subsequent outbreak of World War II with dismany. This program explores the six years preceding America's involvement in the war and explores the question: Could the U.S. have resisted involvement and why did American forces fight in another European war? 45 min. <b>Video/C 6358</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Part 6: 1941-1945: Civilians at War.</b> World War II was the first war in history that killed more civilians than soldiers, as leaders on both sides accepted noncombatant casualties as inevitable--and to some, even desirable. This program studies the courage and strength necessary to face and survive starvation, bombing, torpedoing, massacre, and extermination in camps specifically designed for that purpose. 70 min. <b>Video/C 6359</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Part 7: 1941-1945: Homefront.</b> The shock of Pearl Harbor awoke America from its dream of isolationism. As troops went overseas and industry ramped up to supply the urgent need for war materials, a new wave of Southern blacks migrated north and west to fill the workforce--along with millions of women. This program discusses the effects of World War II on the homefront, spotlighting the war's impact as a catalyst for economic, demographic and social change. 45 min. <b>Video/C 6360</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Part 8: 1946-1952: Best Years.</b> Demobilization after World War II meant difficult changes as the U.S., geared up for war, resumed a peacetime existence. This program describes America's new status as a superpower, as the nation shouldered the responsibility for rebuilding Europe and Japan-- and for containing Soviet ambitions. The challenge faced by veterans and spouses to become reacquainted after years of separation and hardship is highlighted. 45 min. <b>Video/C 6361</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Part 9: 1953-1960: Happy Daze.</b> The post-war baby boom, suburban living and Elvis Presley epitomize the contentment of the Eisenhower years. But these were also years marked by the Korean War, rabid McCarthyism, violent civil rights demonstrations, and a frightening escalation in the Cold War. This program probes the tensions between these crosscurrents in American history. 45 min. <b>Video/C 6362</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Part 10: 1960-1964: Poisoned Dreams.</b> Beset by both international and domestic pressures, America during the Camelot years was swiftly approaching a political-cultural meltdown. This program documents U.S.-Soviet conflicts of interest in Cuba and Vietnam and the growing polarization at home between civil rights activists and segregationist hard-liners, which resulted in the Birmingham riots and the freedom march on Washington, D.C. 43 min. <b>Video/C 6363</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Part 11: 1965-1970: Unpinned.</b> Riots and protests intensified in the U.S. as the war in Vietnam dragged on, with anti-war and civil rights activists seeking violent ways to agitate for peace and equality. This program presents the unrelenting rage that divided the nation during those perilous years, as the Watts race riots, the assissinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy, and the Kent State killings made headline news. 45 min. <b>Video/C 6364</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Part 12: 1971-1975: Approaching the Apocalypse.</b> The one bright spot of the 1970's was Nixon's opening of China to the West while the riots at Attica prison and Kent State University, the trauma of the war in Vietnam and the Watergate scandal, left Americans exhausted, embittered and disillusioned. This program appraises the effects of those blights on the political landscape and their impact on the trust between the government and the governed, so vital to the well-being of a representative democracy such as the United States. 45 min. <b>Video/C 6365</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Part 13: 1976-1980: Starting Over.</b> The women's and civil rights movements, begun decades earlier and as controversial as ever, continued to evolve during the nation's Bicentennial period. This program focuses on the changing momentum of these movements while also looking at the developing environmental movement spurred by the Love Canal disaster, the developing political power of Christians and gays, the controversies that arose over affirmative action and busing, the Iran Hostage Crisis and the development of OPEC. 45 min. <b>Video/C 6366</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Part 14: 1981-1989: New World.</b> The Reagan era witnessed the unexpected end of the Cold War and a welcome return to a booming domestic economy--but did events unfold too quickly to control? This program takes a look at the details and aftershocks both of the dissolution of the Soviet Union and of the yuppie capitalism that threatened to push the limits of the American economy too far. 43 min. <b>Video/C 6367</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Part 15: Then and Now.</b> This program examines key moments of the '90's including the Persian Gulf War, the Oklahoma City bombing, the Waco Branch Davidian disaster, the current status of Afro-Americans and the phenomenon of celebrities created by the media. Then the program, with the assistance of leading futurists, looks ahead to some of the possible events and innovations just over the horizon. 45 min. <b>Video/C 6368</b><br></dd>

<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Part 1: Heaven and Earth: Lindbergh's Journey.</b> In the United States, the 1920s were characterized by a powerful tension that pitted the entrenched forces of tradition against the dynamic energy of modernity. This film seeks to understand that conflict through the story of celebrated aviator Charles Lindbergh. Belonging in spirit to a rapidly disappearing small-town America yet a strong believer in progress, Lucky Lindy captured the imagination of the country as he helped to move the world into a new era. 45 min. <b>Video/C 6342</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Part 2: Heaven and Earth: First Step.</b> "The Eagle has landed!" With those words, a collective dream of humankind came true. This program observes the first landing on the lunar surface from the perspective of the visionary technicians, scientists, and researchers who, in control rooms and laboratories, made it possible for Neil Armstrong to take his "one small step." Their exploits paved the way for eventual landings in the 21st century--on Mars. 41 min. <b>Video/C 6343</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Part 3: Ultimate Power: Evil Rising.</b> How did Adolf Hitler--an Austrian of little means and meager prospects--rise to absolute power in post-World War I Germany? Did the nation's economic and political situation make it inevitable? This program traces Hitler's amazing ascent from corporal in the Great War through his foray into politics, his imprisonment after the bungled Beer Hall Putsch, his bid for the presidency against Paul von Hindenburg, and his subsequent installment as Chancellor. In English and German with English subtitles. 42 min. <b>Video/C 6344</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Part 4: Ultimate Power: The Race.</b> In a devastating instant at Hiroshima, the world was propelled into the age of nuclear armaments. This program, set against the backdrop of World War II, documents the race to invent the atomic bomb: the allied scientists who made it possible, the technological hurdles they overcame, the deep moral issues they confronted, and the responsibility they accepted knowingly or unknowingly for the fate of the free world. 42 min. <b>Video/C 6345</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Part 5: No Man's Land: The Great War.</b> The optimism that fueled the early years of the 20th century vanished as America was drawn into "The war to end all wars." This program presents, through archival footage and first person accounts, the grim story of World War I--including the sinking of the Lusitania and the Bulshevik revolution, which led to Russia's withdrawal from the conflict--and the fruitless struggles of President Wilson, Who sought first to keep America out of the war and then, at its end, to forge a lasting and meaningful peace. 42 min. <b>Video/C 6346</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Part 6: No Man's Land: The Fall.</b> During the Vietnam war the image of desperate people clinging to an evacuation helicopter atop the U.S. embassy, only hours before North Vietnamese troops arrived is seared into the American consciousness. This program uses the story of South Vietnam's last days as a prism through which the dark side of American foreign involvement can be seen. How did the White House and the Pentagon so completely misjudge America's ability to thwart a people's revolution in Southeast Asia? 42 min. <b>Video/C 6347</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Part 7: Memphis Dreams: Innocence and Rebellion.</b> Elvis: Iconoclastic phenomenon, inciting hysteria in teenagers and indignation in parents. On his way to the top he combined the R&amp;B of the Mississippi delta with rocka-billy and tapped into the turbulent forces of youth, sexuality, class, and race, transforming American culture. This program documents the astounding career of Elvis Presley, from his first hits with Sun Records to his final days at Graceland. In the words of John Lennon, "Before Elvis there was nothing." 43 min. <b>Video/C 6348</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Part 8: Memphis Dreams: Searching for the Promised Land.</b> When Martin Luther King, Jr., was assassinated in 1968 Memphis--like Dallas in 1963--became a symbol of hope extinguished. This program examines the Civil Rights Movement and the last few years of Martin Luther King's life with emphasis on the sanitation workers strike in Memphis, Tennessee and the killing of America's greatest civil rights leader, its impact on Afro-Americans and the nation. 46 min. <b>Video/C 6349</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Part 9: Coming Apart: Nothing to Fear.</b> In the early 1930's mass unemployment, widespread hunger, and a mood of fearful pessimism and simmering unrest were Herbert Hoover's legacy to American's new chief executive. This program spotlights the early days of Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency, where he scrambled to transform the New Deal from a campaign slogan to nothing short of a social revolution--while staving off attacks by those who viewed him as a dictator and his reforms as a threatening turn to the left. 43 min. <b>Video/C 6350</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Part 10: Coming Apart: Picture This.</b> In the late 1940's, while the Soviet Union and the U.S. eyed each other over the Iron Curtain, conservative Americans at all levels of society worried about communist infiltration--especially in the movie industry, since that medium plays a huge role in shaping public perceptions and attitudes. This program reveals a time of McCarthyism and career-ending blacklists, a time when freedom of speech itself became a casualty in the desperate fight to protect democracy from "The red menace." 43 min. <b>Video/C 6351</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Part 11: The Evolution of Revolution: Live from Tehran.</b> During the Carter administration, Iranian students seized the American embassy in Tehran--and 53 American hostages--to begin a standoff that lasted until Ronald Reagan's inauguration 444 days later. What factors prompted that act of terrorism? This program examines the history of America's relations with Iran and the consequences of an American foreign policy shaped more by a desire to protect an oil-dependent standard of living and opposition to communist expansion than to promote democracy. 73 min. <b>Video/C 6352</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Part 12: The Evolution of Revolution: Facing the New Millennium.</b> What can the costly yet valuable lessons of the past century suggest about the future of the United States, its partners in the Global Village, and planet Earth itself? What will be the long-term impact of the Internet and the Human Genome Project? Who will be the world's new movers and shakers? In this program, eminent visionaries share their observations on the last hundred years and offer their predictions regarding events and innovations yet to come. 14 min. <b>Video/C 6353</b><br></dd>

<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Age of Hope, 1900.</b> The dawn of the twentieth century was forged in hope and optimism. Here interviewees from Europe, Asia and the United States (boasting an average age of 102), recount the part they played in the century's early history. Whether fighting on the barricades of the failed Russian Revolution of 1905 or campaigning for votes for women; recalling the Paris Exposition of 1900, or President McKinley's assassination or witnessing the sinking of the Titanic, all remember the changes they lived through and the clash of forces and ideas before World War I. <b>Video/C 5555</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Killing Fields, 1914.</b> In August 1914, the people of Europe were swept into the first of the wars that would make this century the bloodiest ever. Seventy million soldiers from more than twenty countries marched off to do their duty. In this film soldiers from all sides give a personal account of the trenches and the tactics--and the terrible nature and scale of the slaughter that shattered the old world order. In the end, four empires collapsed and nine million gave their lives. Some became pacificts while others sought retribution and many found themselves fighting another war only two decades later. <b>Video/C 5543</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Red flag, 1917.</b> When Lenin's Bolsheviks stormed the Winter Palace in 1917, they did so in the name of a new ideology. Millions were drawn by its promise. In this film the people who were there--from members of the Red Guard to party activists to students--explain how Communism appealed to their deepest hopes and dreams. Through them, we hear how Communist leadership, under Vladimir Lenin and later, Joseph Stalin, compromised the proletarian ideal--and how hope eventually gave way to despair. <b>Video/C 5544</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Lost Peace, 1919</b> After the First World War a whole generation was traumatized by the horror of war and vowed that war would be a thing of the past. This film revists the popular hopes and experiences in the years following World War I--and the looming threat of a new nationalism. Despite Woodrow Wilson's promise of a "people's peace", defeated nations were resentful and unreconciled. As fascism and militarism spread, worldwide pacifist movements fought an increasingly unsuccessful rearguard action to preserve the dream of peace. <b>Video/C 5547</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>On the Line, 1924.</b> When Henry Ford's Model T rolled onto the scene in 1908, it was inconceivable that it would ever be anything more than a plaything for the wealthy. But mass production and later, Ford's moving assembly line, allowed manufacturers to produce goods at affordable prices that made them accessible to a new mass market. This film follows the acceleration of mass production, from the days of master craftsmen to the pressures and benefits of assembly-line work to the growing strength of "people power" as labor and management struggled to divide the fruits of increased productivity. <b>Video/C 5546</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Great Escape, 1927.</b> By the mid-1920s, millions worldwide were already confirmed "moviegoers". Movies reflected and affected the way people dressed, thought and spoke, teaching the inexperienced about love and courage, while the governments around the globe were quick to realize the power of film: this new mass entertainment would also prove an unrivaled tool of mass persuasion. Here moviegoers reminisce, revealing how the new medium persuaded, influenced and entralled them, as it offered a welcome refuge from the century's pressures. <b>Video/C 5549</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Breadline, 1929.</b> The 1920s found Americans enjoying the fruits of a new prosperity in a post-war boom. Then, in 1929, the New York Stock Exchange crashed; banks failed and industry withered. From Europe and the United States to Latin America and Asia, the Great Depression shattered economies and communities worldwide. In this film the people who were there remember the blow as workers from the United States, Chile, Britain, Belgium and Scandinavia recall the hungry 1930s. <b>Video/C 5550</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Sporting Fever, 1930.</b> In the early 1900's, competitive sports were still not far removed from recreation--more for the player than the spectator. This film follows boxing, baseball, soccer, and more, as sports transition from a modest pastime to a fiercely competitive--and commercial-- business to a potent expression of national pride and politics. Throughout, sports fans the world over remember the drama, the thrill, the exhilaration--and the patriotism--their favorite athletes and sports teams aroused. Includes a look at the role of American sportswriters, and live radio and television broadcasting of sporting events. <b>Video/C 5545</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Total War, 1939.</b> The Second World War was the first modern conflict in which millions more civilians died than soldiers. In this film, eyewitnesses from Britain, Germany, Russia, Korea, Japan and the United States tell the story of the civilians who suffered and died. Residents of Plymouth, Tokyo, and Hamburg remember the air raids; Russian peasants recall the siege of Leningrad; Japanese soldiers and Korean slave-laborers describe the brutality of war in Asia. <b>Video/C 5551</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Brave New World, 1945.</b> Just over fifty years ago, Soviet and American troops met at the River Elbe and rejoiced at the defeat of Nazi Germany but their optimism was short lived. This film tracks the building tensions between these two superpowers, from the post-war world of the late 1940s through the early 1960s, as the hope for peace swiftly disintegrated into a "cold" war. Here eyewitnesses recall the meeting on the Elbe, the impact of Stalin, Churchill and Khrushchev, propaganda wars between the two nations, the Berlin blockade, the Hungarian uprising and the installation of the Berlin Wall. <b>Video/C 5552</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Fallout, 1945.</b> Tells of the impact of nuclear energy upon the world starting with the first use of the atomic bomb at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and covering nuclear testing, the "arms race", protest movements against nuclear armaments and nuclear power and the nuclear power plant accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. <b>Video/C 6432</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Boomtime, 1948.</b> After World War II, the USA enjoyed unparalleled prosperity while Europe and much of the rest of the world suffered from devastation, lack of food and other necessities, and unemployment. The American Marshall Plan assisted Europe greatly in its recovery from the war and helped Europeans learn the 'American way' of doing things. Europeans began changing their economy by themselves and became consumers as well as producers. This prosperity lasted until 1973, when the certainty of cheap oil and a world dominated by the West was over. It was the beginning of the end of the greatest boom of the century. <b>Video/C 6444</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Asia Rising, 1951.</b> Japan began the slow painful process of reconstruction after World War II, while Korea, after the Korean War, was one of the poorest countries in the world. This program documents how Japan and Korea managed to rise above the strife of war to develop into world economic powers, setting the global pace for competition in the late 20th century. <b>Video/C 6433</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Living Longer, 1954.</b> With the advent and widespread use of penicillin during the Second World War and a greater understanding of microbiology, astonishing advances in Western medicine and public health followed as age-old diseases were systematically tackled in the United States and around the world. Millions hoped that new medical technologies would offer them better health--and longer lives. <b>Video/C 6434</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Endangered Planet, 1959.</b> Throughout the 20th century the natural world has been assaulted as never before by advancing technology. This film chronicles the rise of the environmental movement which began in the late 1950's when it was first uncovered that unbridled industrial and economic growth can have a devastating impact on the quality of life on earth. <b>Video/C 6435</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Skin Deep, 1960.</b> Skin deep examines the fight against legal, institutionalized racism in the United States and South Africa. In 1948, South Africa became unique among nations by writing segregation into the law of the land. The architects of apartheid took comfort in the fact that racial segregation was also found in the world's greatest democracy--the United States. <b>Video/C 6436</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Picture Power, 1963.</b> This film examines the development of the power of television to sway public opinion and unite the world. Includes televised coverage of the 1939 World's Fair, the coronation of Queen Elizabeth, the Kennedy-Nixon debates, the assassination of John F. Kennedy, man's first steps on the moon, the Munich Olympics, direct satellite broadcasting and the revolution in Eastern Europe in 1989. All became, through television, the shared experiences of humankind thanks to the immediacy of the small screen. <b>Video/C 6437</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Great Leap, 1965.</b> Profiles the history of China from the revolution in 1949, through the Mao years, to the various reform and protest movements in the 1960's, 1970's and 1980's. Topics covered include Mao's 1949 takeover, the advent of collective farms, the "Great Leap Forward", the Red Guards and the Cultural Revolution. With the death of Mao came a re-emergent China's new focus on stability and increasing prosperity. <b>Video/C 6438</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Young Blood, 1968.</b> By 1960 almost half the U.S. population was under eighteen years of age. By 1968, the conservative '50s had been overtaken by full-blown social and political revolt. In Europe, students rioted and demonstrated for greater intellectual freedom--and against the rigid values of the parents' generation. This film revisits the Civil Rights Movement, the beginnings of Students for a Democratic Society, the experience of the Vietnam War, student protests in 1968 Paris, anti-war movements, the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, the Weather Underground, the advent of rock and roll, hippies, counter-culture, yippies and anti-nuclear campaigns. <b>Video/C 6439</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Half the People, 1970.</b> Inspired by the successes of the Civil Rights Movement, women began to challenge discrimination on the basis of gender. The National Organization for Women was founded in 1966 to support full equality for women in America. In the boardroom and other bastions of male power, women pressed their demands with growing success. This film examines the history of the women's rights movements in the United States, Iran, Mexico, Denmark, China and Africa. <b>Video/C 6440</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>Guerrilla Wars, 1973.</b> Examines how highly motivated guerrillas have organized revolts that eventually defeated large well-equipped governments. Using interviews and archival footage this film examines the Cuban revolution, America's futile struggle in Vietnam and the Soviet Union's equally unsuccessful attempts to control Afghanistan. <b>Video/C 6441</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>God Fights Back, 1979.</b> By mid-century, modern technology and Western thought had swept religion to the margins of public life. Since then millions have turned back to God--and taken political action based on their religious beliefs. In Iran, a resurgence in Islamic fundamentalism led to a revolt against the Shah and to the return of the long exiled Ayatollah Khomeini. In the U.S., religious fundamentalism was also on the march, the Christian faithful eager to restore a "nation under God." <b>Video/C 6442</b><br></dd>

The 1920s : a decade of contradictions -- The 1930s : the great depression -- The 1940s : war, recovery and rebirth.<br>
Brings the 20th century back to life through narration, rare photographs and stunning footage. Disc 1 covers events from 1900-1950. <b>The 1900s</b> : the seeds of progress: The turn of the century ignites enormous changes, not only for the calendar, but also for society. Milestones include: the industrial revolution and the rise of urban living; massive immigration to the U.S.; the rise of black culture and institutions; the assassination of President McKinley; and the emergence of the U.S. as a global power. <b>The 1910s</b> : the modern age begins: As technology moves forward and international struggles flare, warfare rises to a new, more murderous level. Milestones include: giant leaps in transportation, telecommunications, oil and steel industries; revolutions in Mexico, Ireland, Russia and Germany; the first World War; women's suffrage movements; and the emergence of nickelodeons and jazz music. <b>The 1920s</b> : a decade of contradictions: "The Roaring Twenties," as they are known, see a major polarization of people around the world --people who embrace change, and those who fear it. Milestones include: prohibition leads to bootlegging and organized crime; African-American culture accelerates and membership in the KKK reaches an all-time high; Stalin and Mussolini gain power as America turns its back on international affairs; American cities boom while agriculture lags; and big spending and overproduction lead to the stock market crash. <b>The 1930s</b> : the great depression: The stock market crash of 1929 ushers in a severe economic crisis in the United States and contributes to the rise of international tension. Milestones include: U.S. unemployment tops 15 million; drought devastates the Great Plains; FDR implements his "New Deal"; Americans turn to baseball, radio and movies for entertainment and escapism; and Stalin begins to "purge" his enemies while Japan and Germany flex their military muscles. <b>The 1940s</b> : war, recovery and rebirth: With Americans still struggling through a severe economic depression, the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor leads the United States into the second global conflict of the century. Milestones include: World War II, the Holocaust and the atomic bomb; women enter the work force in large numbers; Israel declares its independence; the Baby Boom begins; and entertainment shifts to Big Bands, the jitterbug and crooners including Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra. <b>DVD X3170</b><br></dd>

<b>The 1950s</b> : promoting the American dream: The U.S. solidifies its position as a world leader, while on the home front; the "traditional family" takes center stage.
