<dt><b>America's Stone Age Explorers: Where Did the First Americans Come From?</b></dt>
<dd>Archaeological experts and others challenge the theory that the first Americans arrived in America around 13,500 years ago and suggest possibilites that they could have arrived even sooner. This television program asks the question "who were America's first settlers?" While the discovery of spear points in Clovis, New Mexico in the 1930's led scientists to conclude that the earliest settlers crossed the land bridge from Siberia to Alaska at the end of the last ice age, new findings challenge this theory. This documentary presents an engaging debate between several scientists and archeologists concerning new findings which suggest the settlers may have been in America much earlier, and that they may have come from Europe, rather than Asia. Visits the sites of promising, yet controversial findings in Pennsylvania, Texas, Chile, and France in order to reconsider long-held beliefs about America's first inhabitants.
