The last of a four part series packed with personal remembrances and rare archival footage of the Irish immigration to America.

The Kennedys were considered America's royalty, especially when patriarch Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., was appointed ambassador to England and his son, John F. Kennedy became the first Irish-Catholic president of the United States. In contrast to the Kennedy's basking in their assimilation as Americans, the playwright, Eugene O'Neill, was fiercely Irish and kept his family roots exposed in most of his classic plays preferring to relive his family's bitter struggle to remain Irish in America.
