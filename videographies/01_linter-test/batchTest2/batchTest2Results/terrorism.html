<dd>On the morning of September 11, 2001, brothers Jules and Gedeon Naudet were working on a documentary about a rookie New York City firefighter.

With cameras rolling, the Naudets follow NYC firefighters into the heart of what would be known as Ground Zero. A striking tribute to real-life heroes who rose to extraordinary acts of courage and compassion. Originally broadcast on CBS in 2001. 130 min. <b>DVD 1320</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>9/11: Press for Truth</b></dt>
<dd>Although independent investigations began within weeks of both Pearl Harbor and the Kennedy assassination, the same was not true of the attacks of September 11th. Most are unaware that formation of the 9/11 Commission was strongly opposed by many in Washington, including the Bush administration. It was only due to pressure from a small group of grieving families, led by twelve who called themselves the Family Steering Committee, that, 14 months after the attacks, the first hearing finally began. Here, five of the members of that Committee (including the Jersey Girls) tell their story, providing powerful arguments for why 9/11 still needs to be investigated. The film-makers stitch together rare, overlooked news clips, buried stories about Pakistani involvement in the 9/11 attacks, and government press conferences, revealing a pattern of official lies, deception, and spin. The documentary is based in part on the "Complete 9/11 Timeline" (published by HarperCollins as "The Terror Timeline") that was compiled by citizen investigator Paul Thompson. Special features (30 min.): Theatrical trailer ; Congressional testimonies by Lorie Van Auken and Paul Thompson: "One Year Later." Thompson reports on the terrible errors and dereliction of responsibility of those in NORAD and the Federal Aviation Administration during those first minutes when planes were hijacked or striking the buildings. Widow Lorie Van Auken describes how the victims' families began to agitate for the formation of the 9/11 Commission and how many questions remained unanswered in its Report. 2006. 85 min. <b>DVD 6285</b><br></dd>

Part I, The greatest story ever told: Denounces the originality of many world religions, arguing they are mainly derived from astrological myths and traditions established long before them. Also argues that the historical Jesus is a fictional creation, nurtured in the interest of political control.<br>
Part II, All the world's a stage: Asserts that the events of September 11th were either orchestrated by, or allowed to happen by, elements within the United States government. This was done in order to generate mass fear, initiate and justify the War on Terror, provide a pretext for the denial of civil liberties to the general public, and produce economic gain.<br>
Part III, Don' t mind the men behind the curtain: Explores the history of the Federal Reserve bank, asserting that they engineered the Great Depression and every American war of the 20th century in order to enrich the international banking community. Also explores the possibility that there is a clandestine movement to merge the United States, Canada and Mexico into a North American Union that uses a single currency, in hopes of eventually creating one world government. c2009. 85 min. <b>DVD X2524</b> 2008. 122 min. <b>DVD X6896</b><br>

<dt><b>Not in My Name</b></dt>
<dd>An independently produced documentary which presents an alternate view to the mass media presentations of America's "war on terrorism." It explains the background to the war, and the central part the U.S. played in actually creating the power of Osama bin Laden and explores the way the control of television coverage has become a central issue in the war, with mainstream broadcasters relaying government propaganda. Bush claims his war is a war between good and evil. Others believe it is a war about oil and global domination. The U.S. says they will attack terrorist anywhere in the world, but who decides who is a terrorist?<br>

As Hamdan&rsquo;s trial progresses, his military lawyers challenge fundamental flaws in the court system.

<dt><b>The Forest for the Trees.</b></dt>
<dd>On May 29, 1990, Earth First! organizer Judi Bari's car was bombed in Oakland, California. Within three hours of the bombing, Bari was accused of transporting the explosives that had nearly killed her.

For the next twelve years, Bari and civil rights lawyer Dennis Cunningham would pursue a federal civil rights suit against the FBI and the Oakland police department. This documentary, directed by Cunningham's daughter, is an intimate, behind-the-scenes look at Bari's fight, an important instance of the false and damaging association of dissent with crime and terrorism.

<dd>"In the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Islamic fundamentalism has, in the minds of many, taken the place once held by communism as the leading threat to the safety and security of the industrialized West.
