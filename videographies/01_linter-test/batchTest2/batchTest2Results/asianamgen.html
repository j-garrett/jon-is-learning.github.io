<dt><b>[Fulbeck, Kip] Kip Fulbeck, Selected Videos</b></dt>
<dd>Volume 1 : Game of death : the legendary Bruce Lee is examined in the various roles he posthumously came to represent, from Fulbeck's own boyhood idol to Asian American male icon; A day at the fair : examines personal identity within the context of race, ethnicity, and sexuality; Banana split : takes the viewer from childhood fights to adult dilemmas, questions interracial dating patters and media depictions of Asian men, and explores the idea of ethnic identity in a country which ignores multiraciality; Lilo &amp; me : the question "Which celebrity do you most resemble?" starts a rollicking ride in which Fulbeck documents his uncanny resemblance to Pochahontas, Mulan, Aladdin and other "ethnically ambiguous" animated characters, thereby examining the muting of race in mainstream media and its effects on multiracial Americans. Volume 2 : Some questions for 28 kisses : confronts the viewer with images of Asian female/non-Asian male pairings in American movies and mass media, examining topics such as interracial dating, ethnic fetishes and race identity; Asian studs nightmare : a wacky spoof on the racial politics operating behind a hit television dating show; Sweet or spicy? : in the context of a telephone dating service, examines dating relationships for men of mixed Asian / white descent and probes Asian American male sexuality in popular culture; Sex, love &amp; Kung Fu : a comical look at two crazed kung fu fanatics who argue over Asian American masculinity and the nature of martial arts films; L.A. Christmas : documents the quintessential American Christmas in a delightfully playful home movie about home movies, featuring a 9-year-old black belt, Buddhists butchering Christmas carols and a nephew reciting pi to 200 digits; Nine fish : Fulbeck uses his artistic abilities with the camera to express his personal reflection on the impact of his Cantonese grandmother's continuing physical decline.

<dd>Looks at the legacy of the case of Vincent Chin, a young Chinese American man who was attacked and killed at his bachelor's party at a suburban Detroit bar by current and former autoworkers who were unhappy with competition from Japanese auto manufacturers. The case attracted wide attention after Chin's attackers struck a plea bargain and were sentenced to three thousand dollars in fines and three years in prison, time that they never were required to serve after posting bail. Indignation by the Asian American community and others led to further charges being filed against the perpetrators. The film explores how the murder of Vincent Chin continues to have meaning to society today, as well as how the hate crime remains unknown or forgotten in many Americans' minds. Written &amp; produced by Curtis Chin ; directed by Tony Lam. 2009. 40 min. <b>DVD X3182</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>Western Eyes</b></dt>
<dd>Examines the search for beauty and self-acceptance through the experiences of a young Filipina and Korean woman living in Canada who both believe their appearance, specifically their eyes, affect the way they are perceived. Both feel unsettled in Western society and are contemplating cosmetic surgery on their eyes. Layering interviews with references to super models and other pop-culture icons of beauty, the filmmaker captures the pain that almost always lies behind the desire for plastic surgery.
