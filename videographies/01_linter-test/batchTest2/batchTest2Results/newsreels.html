<dt><font color="#00CC99"><font size="+2">B</font></font>efore the advent of television and broadcast news, there were newsreels. Newsreels were 5 to 10 minute motion picture compilations highlighting the news of the day. These films were shown between feature films in motion picture theaters. Among the best-known early newsreel series were the <i>Path&eacute;-Journal</i>, shown first in England and France, and the <i>Path&eacute; Weekly</i>, produced for American audiences. <i>The March of Time</i>, produced in the United States by Time, Inc. was one of the most successful US newsreel of the 1930's and 40's.<br>

<dt><b>Cameramen at War.</b> (1943)</dt>
<dd>Compiled by Len Lye. A tribute to the cameramen of the British military film units and the newsreel companies that sent back front-line reports. Most of the film shown is of World War II, with special emphasis on the European and North African combat areas. 15 min. Video/C 5027<br></dd>
<dt><b>Citizen Kane</b> (1941)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Orson Welles. Cast: Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten, William Alland, Everett Sloane, Agnes Moorehead. When one of the world's richest and most influential men dies muttering the word "Rosebud", a newspaper's managing editor insists that Kane's obituary film is missing something and "needs an angle." He orders his top reporter Thompson (Alland) to discover what "Rosebud" means. Thompson searches for, finds, and interviews five key figures, but ulimately does not solve the mystery. Because Kane was purportedly based on newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst, efforts were made to surpress the film, by 'Hearst hatchet woman' Louella Parsons, among others.<br>
"The movie opens with newsreel obituary footage that briefs us on the life and times of Charles Foster Kane; this footage, with its portentous narration, is Welles' bemused nod in the direction of the ``March of Time'' newsreels then being produced by another media mogul, Henry Luce. They provide a map of Kane's trajectory, and it will keep us oriented as the screenplay skips around in time, piecing together the memories of those who knew him."

<dt><b>Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?</b></dt>
<dd>This documentary juxtaposes newsreel footage, film clips and period music in an eye-opening look at the Great Depression. Many of the movies created in the 1930s featured strong social commentary, while others offered pure escapism and fed a fascination with a dazzling world out of reach to the everyday American. Through a contrast between the fantasy of film and the reality of everyday life, a fascinating perspective on the Great Depression and Hollywood's golden age is presented. Also includes political speeches by Franklin D. Roosevelt and others.1975. 112 min. <b>DVD 450</b><br>

What you're pledged to defend is essentially everything that can be claimed American, multicultural style. Sprinkled liberally throughout are unique glimpses of just about every aspect of life in the U.S. as it existed at the time of filming (1968) with carefully spaced glimpses of men in arms. <b>Tragedy or hope?</b>: Revised version of the film "Brink of disaster" reissued in the same year and included on this DVD. <b>Brink of disaster</b>: A fantasy story about a student and Vietnam veteran who defends a university library against a night attack by radicals bent on destroying its collections. Initially in league with the "radicals" he decides to reject their cause after his patriotic ancestors return to haunt him and a history professor explains he has become an unwitting dupe of a communist conspiracy to undermine American society. <b>Columbia revolt</b>: This documentary of the student protests and riots at Columbia University in 1968, presents the events as they happened from the perspective of the students, from the early stages of what began as a demonstration but quickly became an occupation by students of campus facilites, setting off a chain of events ultimately resulted in a two month long, violent siege. <b>Red Chinese battle plan</b>: Newsreel report on French military operations against Vietnamese guerillas.
