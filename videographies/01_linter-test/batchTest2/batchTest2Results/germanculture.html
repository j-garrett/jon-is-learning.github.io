<dd>A film essay by Peter Buchka analyzing Herzog's work through extracts from his films and statements by the filmmaker himself. From the very outset of Herzog's film career, his intellectual quest has taken him to marginal groups. In their ecstatic isolation he has sought to regain a measure of humanity and human dignity. Herzog's heroes generally fail, however, in a measure proportional to the effort they expend -- which is precisely what makes them heroes in Herzog's eyes, because it elevates their stories to the level of myths. 1988. 60 min.
