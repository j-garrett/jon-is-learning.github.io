Eighty-one year old Nat Moyer is a compulsive and fanciful talker, a feisty philosopher, and a troublemaker given to assuming personalities.

<dt><b>When Angels Fall (Gdy spadaja anioly)</b> (Poland, 1959)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Roman Polanski. A church bell chimes. An old woman stops to feed pigeons on her way to work in the men's lavatory in the basement of a public building. She sits all day by the lavatory door as little dramas play out -- of illness, assignation, and routine -- a few tips her only acknowledgment. The sound of footsteps on the floor above her brings a reverie of her youth, when she was a beauty, the day a platoon of soldiers marched into her valley. As the day in the basement proceeds, she completes a set of memories that takes her from passion to maternal love to rejection and tragedy. Could there be more awaiting her on this day of remembering the fruit of her womb? [<a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0052838/plotsummary">IMDB</a>] 21 min. <b>DVD 1935 disc 2</b><br></dd>
<dt><b>White Angel (Beyaz melek)</b>(Turkey, 2007)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Yilmaz G&uuml;ney. Cast: Ali S&uuml;rmeli, Arif Erkin, Bilge Zobu, Cezmi Baskin, Cihat Tamer. An old and ill Kurdish man named Ahmet visits Istanbul to receive medical treatment. Overwhelmed by the medical procedure, he runs away and sits on the steps of an old people's home to rest. The inhabitants of the home invite him inside thinking that he has been dumped there by his children, just like all the other old people in the home. When Ahmet's sons locate and retrieve their father, Ahmet invites them to his east Anatolian village in Diyarbakir. The journey of this interesting group of people is not only a voyage from the urbanized, west of Turkey into the rural east, but a journey back to long forgotten ideals of family unity and co-operation, where the elderly receive the traditional care and respect from the young which has diminished in urban society. 118 min. <b>DVD X5903</b></dd>
