<dt><b>Liberia: An Uncivil War</b></dt>
<dd>Provides an in-depth case study of one of the many brutal civil wars that have sprung up across Africa. It is also an exciting example of war-time journalism--harrowing reporting with bullets ricocheting just feet from the camera--placed in a historical context stretching back nearly two hundred years. Reporter Jonathan Stack is besieged in the Liberian capital of Monrovia where President Charles Taylor says he will not leave until peacekeepers are in place. James Barbazon, embedded with The LURD (Liberians United For Reconcilation and Democracy) who have pledged to pillage the country until President Taylor leaves, introduces General Cobra, Col. Black Diamond and other soldiers, slightly more than children. On August 5th 2003 - with the rebels at the bridges leading to Monrovia, the Nigerians are at last persuaded to send 750 peacekeepers and the U.N. soon follows with 14,000. But what remains in the viewer's mind is President Bush's empty promises of help during the darkest days of Liberia's civil war. Produced and directed by Jonathan Stack. 2004. 102 min. <b>DVD 4337</b><br></dd>

<dd>Documents economic and social conditions in Malawi, where 3 million of a 12 million population live in abject poverty. During the 1990s, non-governmental organizations such as the World Food Program distributed seeds and farm tools to the poor, and the government allowed them to live and farm on public land. The program's subsidies supported the farmers during poor growing seasons. The World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund have forced the Malawi government to stop the subsidies, starving millions. AIDS is so pervasive in Malawi that many widows prefer starvation for themselves and their families to seeking a new mate. Due to AIDS and food shortages, there are more than one million orphans in Malawi. Dist.: <a href="http://www.films.com">Films Media Group.</a> 2004. 26 min. <b>DVD 5447</b><br></dd>

<dd>To fulfill the Millennium Development goals, many poor countries are now implementing Poverty Reduction Strategy Programs (PRSPs). But in Malawi, PRSPs are viewed by many as merely a new version of old World Bank policies, with decisions ultimately made in Washington, rather than by the country's own citizens. This report investigates the PRSP process and its effectiveness in Malawi with interviews with citizens in rural communities, government officials, civil society campaigners, World Bank economists and critics of World Bank policies.

<dt><b>Milking the Rhino</b></dt>
<dd>A ferocious kill on the Serengeti; warnings about endangered species... These clich&eacute;s of nature films ignore a key landscape feature: villagers just off-camera who endure the dangers and costs of living with wild animals. The Maasai tribe of Kenya and Namibia's Himba -- two of earth's oldest cattle cultures -- are emerging from a century of 'white man's conservation,' which threw them off their lands, banned subsistence hunting and fueled resentment. They are discovering that earnings from wildlife tourism can rival the benefits of livestock. But change is not easy. Charting the collision of ancient ways with Western expectations, this film offers complex, intimate stories of Africans at the forefront of community-based conservation.

Research into how and why these private schools have emerged in such unlikely circumstances has been organized by a team from the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Their research reveals that in communities like Makoko, parents are voting with their feet. They think the state system has failed, and a new and interesting grass roots movement in education seems to be the result. Produced and directed by Dick Bower. 23 min. <b>DVD 8386</b><br></dd>

<dd>Examines the humanitarian, environmental and economic devastation caused by 50 years of oil extraction in Nigeria's Niger Delta. In the summer of 2008, militants from the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) declared an "oil war" in Nigeria. Escalating unrest and kidnappings by militants have shut down as much as 40% of oil production in the region. Meanwhile, the people of the Delta continue to suffer as they have for half a century. Billions of dollars of crude oil are pumped out from beneath their feet while they live in desperate poverty without means of a livelihood in a decimated environment. Oil spills, dredging and acid rain from gas flaring have destroyed habitats, killed the fish population, fouled the soil and poisoned the villagers.

<dt><b>Nabantwa Bam' With my children: A Family Portrait</b>(Real stories from a free South Africa; v. 5)</dt>
<dd>This film is a fascinating case study of the emergence of social classes within the same Black South African family. Two brothers live with their successful and ambitious mother, a market researcher, in a comfortable, middle class Soweto home. The older brother Nhlanhla has suffered a head injury which may be debilitating and has had no time to receive an education that would let him take advantage of the opportunities offered by the new South Africa. Street-wise instead, he spends his time hanging out with his home boys and his dog. His younger brother, Miles, is a 'born free,' the first black student at his all white school and now a programmer with a promising career at Microsoft. Though fond of his brother, his life is in complete contrast to Nhlanhla's. Miles has very clear goals and deadlines for himself; his strong motivation shows what a difference it makes to know that there is no ceiling on one's ambitions. Written and directed by Victor Khulile Nxumalo. 2004. 41 min. <b>DVD 5267</b><br></dd>

"Some time in the 1960's, in the heart of Africa, a new animal was introduced into Lake Victoria as a little scientific experiment. The Nile Perch, a voracious predator, extinguished almost the entire stock of the native fish species. However, the new fish multiplied so fast, that its white fillets are today exported all around the world. Huge hulking ex-Soviet cargo planes come daily to collect the latest catch in exchange for their southbound cargo? Kalashnikovs and ammunitions for the uncounted wars in the dark center of the continent. This booming multinational industry of fish and weapons has created an ungodly globalized alliance on the shores of the world?s biggest tropical lake: an army of local fishermen, World bank agents, homeless children, African ministers, EU-commissioners, Tanzanian prostitutes and Russian pilots."

<dd>Looks at the economic situation in Zambia and how foreign aid is being utilized by the Zambian government and non-governmental organizations.

There are many individual NGOs in Zambia involved in local projects, independent from government and funded directly by international donors. But now the government is arguing that it should be in control of dispersing all international development aid. The days of individual donors funding individual projects could be a thing of the past.
