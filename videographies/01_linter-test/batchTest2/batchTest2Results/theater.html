The story of legendary producer Florenz Ziegfeld introduces the era's key figures: songwriter Irving Berlin, comedienne-singer Fanny Brice and comic Bert Williams -- America's first "crossover" artists -- and brash song-and-dance man George M. Cohan, Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II unleased Broadway's potential with the groundbreaking Show Boat. <b>DVD 3077</b><br></dd>

Marilyn Miller, the Marx Brothers, and Al Jolson rocketed to stardom, as songwriter teams like George and Ira Gershwin, Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle, and Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart wrote the music that seduced the nation with New York City's syncopated rhythm.

Rodgers and Hart returned to New York to create new shows, stars like Ethel Merman and Ethel Waters became top box office draws, and George Gershwin created his epic folk opera, Porgy and Bess. The advent of World War II prompted Irving Berlin to write one of his biggest hits, This is the Army. <b>DVD 3078</b><br></dd>

With On the town, Leonard Bernstein, Betty Comden, Adolph Green, and Jerome Robbins musicalized wartime New York and Irving Berlin and Ethel Merman triumphed with Annie get your gun. Shows like Kiss me, Kate, Guys and dolls, and My fair lady offered sophisticated literary adaptations, and the Ed Sullivan show brought a television spot-light to Broadway.

But in the era of rock &amp; roll and tumultuous social change, Broadway reinvented itself and established new traditions. The conceptual theater of John Kander &amp; Fred Ebb's Cabaret, as directed by Hal Prince, was followed by the rock musical Hair and the urban angst of Stephen Sondheim's Company. Bob Fosse showcased sexy cynicism in Chicago, and Michael Bennett created the blockbuster A chorus line.

Julie Taymor re-imagined Disney's The lion king, composer Jonathan Larson scored a bittersweet triumph with Rent, and the old-fashioned musical was reborn in Mel Brooks' The Producers.

<dt><b>Behind the Burly Q</b></dt>
<dd>Burlesque and vaudeville acts were America's most popular form of live entertainment in the first half of the 20th century - until cinema drove them from the mainstream. To add insult to injury, the art of burlesque became vilified and misunderstood, and was largely left out of our cultural history. By telling the intimate and surprising stories from its golden age through the women (and men!) who lived it, Behind the Burly Q reveals the true story of burlesque, even as it experiences a new renaissance. Written, directed, and produced by Leslie Zemeckis.
