" Dead Man is the story of a young man's journey, both physically and spiritually, into very unfamiliar terrain. William Blake travels to the extreme western frontiers of America sometime in the 2nd half of the 19th century. Lost and badly wounded, he encounters a very odd, outcast Native American, named "Nobody," who believes Blake is actually the dead English poet of the same name. The story, with Nobody's help, leads William Blake through situations that are in turn comical and violent. Contrary to his nature, circumstances transform Blake into a hunted outlaw, a killer, and a man whose physical existence is slowly slipping away. Thrown into a world that is cruel and chaotic, his eyes are opened to the fragility that defines the realm of the living. It is as though he passes through the surface of a mirror, and emerges into a previously-unknown world that exists on the other side." [Internet Movie Database] 121 min. <b>DVD 963</b></dd>

<dt><b>A Feather in His Hare</b> (1948)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Chuck Jones. Animated short. A myopic Mohican tries to catch Bugs. Bugs leads the Indian to the rabbit hole with hundreds of signs. Bugs gets tied to a stake and gets away, hitting the guy with snowballs (it's too cold to throw them in the winter). He parts the guy's hair with a tomahawk, and makes a clay jar to smack him with. "Who does dis character think he is anyway?" asks Bugs. The Indian replies: "Me? Me the last of the Mohicans." Pointing skyward, Bugs says: "Oh, da last of da Mohicans, eh? Well, look up, Geronimo." Up above are storks bringing baby Indians. The Indian faints. Bugs says "Oh, Prunella!" and laughs, then looks up and see storks bringing hundreds of baby bunnies. The baby rabbits say, "Ehh, what's up, Pop?" In a classic scene where Bugs is tied up, the Indian has a kettle on the fire and is slicing carrots and onions into the pot. Bugs keeps moving from place to place, and the Indian keeps picking up the kettle and moving near to where Bugs is. <b>DVD 8510</b><br></dd>

In this drama of war on the American frontier between the Apache Indians and the U.S. Cavalry, a military martinet assumes command of a desert fort where his rigid leadership creates dissension and conflict among his family and staff. Frank Nugent, who wrote the script for Fort Apache, recounted the following regarding Ford's approach to history and myth in his movies: "He gave me a list of about fifty books to read - memoires, novels, anything about the period. Later, he sent me down into the old Apache country to nose around, get the smell and feel of the land... When I got back, Ford asked me if I thought I had enough research. I said yes. 'Good,' he said, 'Now just forget everything you've read, and we'll start writing a movie.'" (Anderson, Lindsay. <i>About John Ford</i>. London: Plexus, 1981. pp. 77-79) 127 min. <b>DVD 5669</b></dd>

<dt><b>Little Big Man</b> (1970)</dt>
<dd>Directed by Arthur Penn. Cast: Dustin Hoffman, Martin Balsam, Jeff Corey, Chief Dan George, Faye Dunaway, Richard Mulligan. Jack Crabb (Dustin Hoffman) is 121 years old. And he's done it all. He's been a full-fledged Cheyenne, an Indian fighter, a snake oil merchant, master gunman, drinking buddy of wild Bill Hickok, colleague of Buffalo Bill, and is the only survivor of Custer's Last Stand. Crabb is either the Old West's most neglected hero or the biggest liar ever to cross the Mississippi. Little Big Man is Jack Crabb's story. In their article, "The Hollywood Indian in <i>Little Big Man</i>: A Revisionist View," Margo Kasdan and Susan Tavernetti comment: " In <i>Little Big Man,</i> Arthur Penn directed a film that inverts the mythologies of American frontier history usually presented in the western genre, and, in particular, the story of the westward expansion. The film combines established generic conventions--the post-Civil War period, Great Plains setting, conflict between whites and Indians--with a reconsideration of western history, a revisionist treatment of legendary figures of the time, of the western hero, and of Native Americans in a comic and ironic tone. This combination makes the film distinctive (while at the same time sows the seeds for such contemporary westerns as <i>Dances with Wolves</i>). (<i>Film &amp; History</i>, xxiii (1993), 70). Based on the novel <i>Little Big Man</i> by Thomas Berger (Main Stack PS3552.Be63.L5; Moffitt PS3552.E719.L5)140 min. <b>DVD 1738; vhs 999:420</b></dd>

<dt><b>Peter Pan</b> (1953)</dt>
<dd>Disney. This animated story begins when the hero of Wendy, John and Michael's bedtime stories--Peter Pan--returns to the nursery and invites them on a magical journey to Never Land. With the help of Tinker Bell, his feisty sidekick, and a dazzling shower of pixie dust, Peter Pan teaches them to fly. Off they soar to an enchanted island filled with wonder and adventure. Before they know it, they're knee-deep in a high-flying battle with swashbuckling pirates, led by Peter's arch enemy, Captain Hook--whose time is nearly up against a ticktocking crocodile.<br>
"...the books [by British novelist and playwright J. M. Barrie] have been accused of both racism and sexism. The former charge primarily concerns the portrayal of Native Americans in Peter And Wendy ? the portrayal is highly stereotypical, with Native Americans being shown as warlike primitives who speak in guttural tones. Barrie's treatment of female characters has also been criticized by modern readers ? most of the female characters in Peter And Wendy (Wendy, Tinker Bell, Tiger Lily, and the mermaids) fawn over Peter Pan (and Tinker Bell makes several attempts on Wendy's life, out of jealousy), yet Peter ignores all of their affections. This criticism is also leveled against several more recent adaptations of the story, most notably the 1953 animated Disney film which contains a song often criticized as offensive, "What Makes The Red Man Red?", a catalog of Native American stereotypes." [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan">Wikipedia</a>]:<br>
