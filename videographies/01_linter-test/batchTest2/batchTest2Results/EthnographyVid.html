<dt><b>Across the Frontiers (<i>Tribal Eye</i>).</b></dt>
<dd>Discusses the international processes and positive and negative external forces that effect change in tribal societies.1976 52 min. <b>Video/C 181</b><br></dd>
<dt><b>Albert Kahn's Archive of the Planet</b></dt>
<dd>A peace-loving man with a decidedly global perspective, Albert Kahn spent most of his life and wealth trying to expand Western understanding of other cultures -- largely through film and photography. Originally released in 2007 as a series for BBC television. Dist.: <a href="http://www.films.com">Films Media Group.</a><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"><b>A Vision of the World</b></dd>
<dd>This program delves into Kahn's origins and formative years and the launch of his Archive of the Planet project. Topics include Kahn's Jewish ancestry and Alsacian upbringing; his early success in finance; his admiration of Japanese art and customs; the development of autochrome photography by the Lumi&egrave;re brothers; Marguerite Mespoulet's colorful documentation of Ireland's vanishing Celtic traditions; and Kahn's expedition to Cornwall and London with August Leon. 50 min. <b>DVD X5707</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"><b>Men of the World</b></dd>
<dd>In 1908, Albert Kahn and his chauffeur embarked on a global trek to observe and absorb other cultures -- an early "prototype' of the many photographic missions Kahn would fund over the years. this program illustrates that formative round-the-world trip as well as the 1913 journey undertaken by photographer St&eacute;phane Passet to China, Mongolia and India. Viewers will encounter startling images of early 20th century Manhattan, San Francisco, Tokyo and Beijing, as well as views of nascent Rio de Janeiro and burgeoning Buenos Aires. Scenes from Tsarist Siberia, the Mongolian steppes, a Varanasi teeming with worshippers, and a camel-and-elephant caravan on the Khyber Pass reaffirm the spectacular value of Kahn's grand project. 52 min. <b>DVD X5708</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"><b>Europe on the Brink</b></dd>
<dd>Poverty, emigration, declining birth rates, and ethnic divisions weakened many European countries as the 20th century began. From France to the Balkans, leaders prescribed nationalism and military buildup as the only solutions. This program studies the continent's march to war as depicted in the photographic record commissioned by French banker Albert Kahn. Early color images and film footage explore a range of themes -- including contrasts between urbanization and rural life in France, Germany and Scandinavia, the decline of the Ottoman Empire and its impact in Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece and Macedonia; and the grittiness of everyday life in Europe. kahn's pacifism is also a topic. 51 min. <b>DVD X5709</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"><b>The Soldiers' Story</b></dd>
<dd>As World War I engulfed his country, Albert Kahn struck a deal with the French army: his team of photographers would capture images and footage that helped the war effort in exchange for direct access to militarized zones. A century later, this program presents the results -- revealing the life and environment of the French soldier as recorded in Kahn's Archive of the Planet. The visual details of trench warfare and all its misery are combined with pictures from towns, hospitals , and barracks a few miles from the front -- evoking the humanity of the ordinary fighting man as well as the appalling devastation wrought by the era's instruments of death. 52 min. <b>DVD X5710</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"><b>The Civilians' Story: Albert Kahn's Archive of the Planet</b></dd>
<dd>In addition to documenting the Great War, Albert Kahn's team of photographers recorded the impact of the conflict on French civilian ife. This program explores both the propaganda value and the genuine emotional power in images of the war-torn French populace. French and Belgian refugees, ruined churches, and farms tended by women and the elderly are a few of the subjects rendered in exquisite and moving detail. Soissons smolders after a German retreat; Reims and its shattered cathedral hover on the edge of total destruction; and the Alsace region, Kahn's birthplace, regains its French identity. 52 min. <b>DVD X5711</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"><b>Europe After the Fire</b></dd>
<dd>Versailles, 1919: French banker Albert Kahn and his camera team are among the few photographers allowed inside the Hall of Mirrors for the treaty signing -- an example of Kahn's uncanny talent for documenting change. This program focuses on Kahn's pictorial record of the war's aftermath and the challenges of securing a true peace across Europe. Zeppelin-borne aerial footage conveys the scope of the destruction, while grave-digging and burial scenes evoke the staggering number of combatants killed. Other events and subjects include the influx of foreign workers that filled France's labor void; the French occupation of the Rhineland; German breadlines and Paris dance-halls; and war monuments in London and Verdun. 52 min. <b>DVD X5712</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"><b>Middle East, The Birth of Nations</b></dd>
<dd>No sooner had Europe declared an end to its Great War than the seeds of new conflict were sewn -- in the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire. With typical global awareness, photography archivist Albert Khan chose to document the historic changes occurring in the colonial Middle East. This program traces his team's expeditions into Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine as Western powers redrew the map of the region. The French takeover of Syria, the Balfour Declaration, and Turkey&rsquo;s war with Greece come to life in Kahn&rsquo;s street-level films and autochromes-- which also serve as reminders that Jerusalem, like many other Middle East locations, suffered greatly during World War I. 52 min. <b>DVD X5713</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"><b>Far East, Expeditions to Empires</b></dd>
<dd>From 1914 through much of the 1920's, Albert Kahn's photographic team was hard at work in Asia, amassing culturally and historically vital images. This program recounts journeys through Indochina and greater Asia in which the Kahn team opened up a world most Europeans had never dreamed of. Viewers discover Vietnam through its beggars, Tet celebrants and elegantly dressed Mandarin administrators; Cambodia, through its dancers and the imposing Angkor City complex; Japan, through rapidly Westernizing homes, dress and hairstyles; and India, through pictures of the maharajahs and other authorities rendered powerless by British rule. 51 min. <b>DVD X5714</b><br></dd>
<dd><img src="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"> <b>The End of a World</b></dd>
<dd>As they built an unsurpassed visual archive of world culture, Albert Kahn and his photographers turned their attention to widely divergent locations. This program follows the maritime odyssey of Lucien Le Saint, circa 1922, as he captured on film the daily lives of Newfoundland cod fisherman, as well as expeditions into northwestern Africa. Images from Morocco and Tunisia focus on occupying French soldiers, the prostitutes they patronized, and larger changes in those societies, while pictures taken in Dahomey (now Benin) shed light on the symbiotic relationship between Catholocism and the Vodun religion. Viewers also learn about the Colonial Exhibition of 1931, Kahn's financial collapse, and the fate of his archive after his death in 1940. 51 min. <b>DVD X5714</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>Body Art</b></dt>
<dd>Throughout history people in nearly every culture have decorated or altered their bodies. The reasons are as varied as the patterns and processes: they seek to define themselves and their positions in society, to declare their allegiance to a god or to a cause, to conform to the customs of a group or to shock or entertain. From body painting to piercing to scarification, from tattoos to plastic surgery, from the Bronze age to the computer age, this film explores and celebrates the stunning diversity of body art. 2000. 50 min. <b>DVD 1239</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>The Face of Evil</b></dt>
<dd>Surveys the long history of attempts to identify and categorize the physiognomy of evil, from the paintings of Hieronymous Bosch to such "sciences" as physiognomics, phrenology, eugenics, and anthropometrics, to latterday notions of criminal anthropology. The film illustrates these dubious efforts through the historical case study of Bruno Ludke, an alleged serial killer arrested in Germany in 1943. The stockily-built, mentally deficient young man, who was felt by Nazi authorities to have the appearance of a "born criminal," became a guinea pig for a series of biological experiments to validate their beliefs in racial categories, of atavistic or degenerate types, a hierarchical ranking of the "Other."

<dt><b>Religion and Magic</b></dt>
<dd>While all cultures exhibit some religious practices andbeliefs, the forms taken are diverse. The animism practiced by American Indians, the mixture of ancient religion and Roman Catholicism among the Highland Maya, the ritual of Eka Dasa Rudra among the Balinese and successful and unsuccessful modern movements serve to illustrate the thesis. c1983. 30 min. <b>Video/c 578</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>Ruins: A Fake Documentary</b></dt>
<dd>Counterfeiting is a practice with broad implications, from the merest of fake objects to entire histories shaped as facsimile. Here filmmaker Lerner collates early colonial misconceptions of the Mexican populace, a jumble of ethnographic and political distortions. From there he charts the process that recontextualizes archeological objects as art. At the center of the film is master forger Brigido Lara, whose pre-columbian objects have been exhibited in major museums throughout the U.S. and Europe.

<dt><b>The Sacred</b></dt>
<dd>All communities hold something sacred, whether it is a supreme being, nature, or life itself. This program explores the role of the sacred in societies, from the most primitive forms of animism to the contemporary secular institutions that have sacred attributes. The importance of ritual, signs, and specific individuals in disparate cultures is addressed by noted anthropologists. The program also addresses the role of myth, stressing the universal presence of the mother goddess in all early religions. 1997. 48 min. <b>Video/C 9677</b><br></dd>
<dt><b>Secrets of the Tribe</b></dt>
<dd>The field of anthropology goes under the magnifying glass in this fiery investigation of the seminal research on Yanomami Indians. In the 1960s and '70s, a steady stream of anthropologists filed into the Amazon Basin to observe this "virgin" society untouched by modern life. Thirty years later, the events surrounding this infiltration have become a scandalous tale of academic ethics and infighting. Director Jos&eacute; Padilha brilliantly employs two provocative strategies to raise unsettling questions about the boundaries of cultural encounters. He allows professors accused of heinous activities to defend themselves, and the Yanomamo to represent their side of the story. As this riviting excavation deconstructs anthropology's colonial legacy, it challenges our society's myths of objectivity and the very notion of "the other." Director, Jos&eacute; Padilha. c2010. 98 min. <b>DVD X5035</b><br></dd>

<dt><b>Jean Rouch: Premier Film : 1947-1991 (First Film, 1947-1991)</b></dt>
<dd>Filmmaker Jean Rouch improvises a new commentary for his first film made in 1947, "In the land of the Black Magi" (Au pays des mages noirs). He explains the sacrifices he made due to the producer ; his footage was re-edited with a new ending, new titles, stock footage, "tropical muzak," and a newsreel-style narration heavy on drama and highlighting the exotic. Here the insight of Rouch emerges as he "finishes" and restores the film, improvising a new commentary and transforming it into a new form in which the film's true meaning is illuminated and the humanity of the subjects restored. 27 min. <b>DVD 4951</b><br></dd>

In reviewing portions of their filmed s&eacute;ances with ethnographer Richard Werbner, the couple are moved by the diviner's revelations about their intimate lives, but are puzzled by the diviner's rapid recital of highly ambiguous, archaic verse, his leading them in chants of call and response, and his preaching against Christianity and for restored communication with the ancestors, leaving the couple doubting the healing treatment.

<dt><b>Moana: A Romance of the South Seas.</b></dt>
<dd>"Life and love in the South Seas... Robert Flaherty's famous travelogue." The rites, customs, and daily lives of the Samoan natives of Savaii Island, Western Samoa are depicted in this early 20th century ethnographic film. "In 1923, Jesse Lasky of Paramount offered Flaherty the opportunity to shoot a film anywhere in the world?so long as it turned out to be another Nanook. Flaherty, along with his wife and family, traveled to the village of Safune on the Samoan island of Savi?i to record the traditional culture of a civilization which was rapidly changing and becoming westernized under British rule. The result was Moana: A Romance of the Golden Age. Shot in black and white on panchromatic film, Moana has an almost stereoscopic look?the figures seem solid and real and the colors of the island foliage appear as varying shades of silvery-gray. The film explores the lives of the lovely and gentle Samoans and culminates in a ritual tattooing. Although not on the same level as Nanook or some of Flaherty?s later work, Moana was received with critical acclaim and popularity on its release. In fact, John Grierson coined the term "documentary" to describe the film. During the making of Moana, Flaherty, the independent filmmaker, had his first conflict with the studio system when Paramount insisted he cut the film for a slightly shorter running time."

<dt><b>We Have No War-Songs: Gypsies: the Professional Amateurs of Life.</b></dt>
<dd>Since their appearance in Europe first recorded in the 14th century, the Gypsies have always struggled for the freedom to live their own lives in their own way.

Filmed at the seven day gathering of thousands of Gypsies from all over the World in Saintes Maires de-la Mer in the South of France, this film celebrates the unique nature of the Gypsy people and poses questions of tolerance and individuality in today's increasingly materialistic and nationalistic world.

<dt><b>Hajj: Drinking from the Stream.</b></dt>
<dd>A film by Claire Dannenbaum. "Hajj is an experimental ethnography looking at acts of resistence and empowerment in the everyday life of Turkish and Kurdish women. This project explores the notion of performance in everyday life--forms of activity which would otherwise be censurable, dangerous, or threatening--in the context of a gender-segregated and patriarchal culture. While Hajj is not an anthropological film per se, it attempts to counter mainstream ethnographic preoccupation with esoteric or ritual activity (special occasions and "public: culture typically carried out by/for men) by looking at "non-events," or the performative elements in women's domestic tasks. Using footage of village life and women at work, the film addresses the multiple meanings behind women's domestic labor, and the potential social power derived from the marginalized activity of home."

<dt><b>The Pupil of Her Hand, In the Palm of Her Eye.</b></dt>
<dd>A film by Claire Dannenbaum. "A visual exploration of an invisible phenomenon, The Pupil of Her Hand In the Palm of Her Eye maps the cross-cultural and personal journey of the filmmaker's search for an elusive subject, the evil eye. Using footage shot in Morocco, the film traces the irony of looking, gazing and glancing in Moroccan women's culture, where such actions are heavily coded and controlled. Ultimately, an evocation of references that lead to and hover about the evil eye, the film suggests the inherent complexity of ethnographic documents portraying another culture."

To her amazement, and in spite of her lapsed religious beliefs, she must admit that her life has been transformed by the event. And when the press gets ahold of the story what ensues is an amusing look at what it means to believe and to belong. 1997. 57 min. Video/C 5041<br></dd>

<dd>Part of the (who is s/he) project, produced in collaboration with Mama Cash. Camera, Sunny Bergman ... [et. al.] ; editor, Milika de Jong ; final editing IKON, Wessel van der Hammen ; music, Rimer Veeman. Investigates why an increasing number of people in our modern, highly developed societies, are eagerly seeking "authentic," real-life experiences, while at the same time trying to fathom the meaning of the concept itself. "Keeping it Real" profiles a sailor and world adventurer whose exploits are marketed in books, photos and videos to fascinated, wannabe adventurers; goes behind-the-scenes of a city tour with a real-life "homeless" person; interviews an African immigrant whose life experience fulfills a Western fantasy of being more connected to nature; follows an office worker who takes a year off to sail alone around the world; and questions pop-music stars how they distinguish between their public personas and real lives. The idealized representations of 'authenticity' being promoted or pursued are shown to be inherently inauthentic or at least illusory. A Film by Sunny Bergman. 2004. 51 min. <b>DVD 8640</b><br></dd>
