<dt><b>Our Secret Century. </b><dd>(CD-ROM for Macintosh). <dd>Media archaeologist Richard Prelinger presents ten hilarious, disturbing, and revealing archival films.



<br>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10">Volumes 1 and 2.  Contents:  1. The rainbow is yours -- 2. Capitalist realism.   In vol. 1, seven color films explore how 1950s glitz 'n' glamour seduced Americans into an obsession with the look of designed objects; includes "American Look," the definitive Populuxe film, and General Motors' 1956 motorama musical, "Design for dreaming."  In vol. 2, two black-and-white 1930s industrial films  attempt to humanize the face of mass production, very  much like Soviet propaganda, and "Valley Town" tells  the story of a depressed steel town.   <B>Compu/D 345</B>



<br><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10">Volumes 3 and 4.  Contents:  1. The behavior offensive -- 2. Menace and jeopardy. In vol. 3, nine comic and creepy social-guidance classics document the postwar social crusade to instill family values, 1950s style. Highlights: Are  you popular?, Shy guy, and Habit patterns. In vol. 4, seven safety films shot between 1936 and 1962, lecture about the perils of haste and carelessness. Classics of this genre include Time out for trouble, More dangerous than dynamite, and Safety belt for Susie.  <B>Compu/D 346
</B>

<br><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10">Volumes 5 and 6.   Contents: 1. Teenage transgression -- 2. The Uncharted landscape.  In vol. 5, six movies explore the not-so-golden years  of the late fifties and early sixties. White and  Chicano gangs in working class L.A. call a truce in Gang Boy. Robert's downward spiral in The Dropout includes a stint in the malt shop waiting on  his one-time peers and The Terrible truth is that nice girls get hooked on "horse". Vol. 6 is a rare visual  record of the changing face of urban and rural America,  the blank slate upon which fantasies of growth and  prosperity were enacted. In the Suburbs celebrates the  swingin' white suburban dream (a paradise for advertisers), and in American Harvest the exploitation of our bountiful natural resources culminates in...a Chevrolet.  <B>Compu/D 347  </B>

<br>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10">Volumes 7 and 8.   Contents:  1. Gender roll call -- 2. Tireless marketers.  Vol. 7 considers how and when girls and boys learn to be true to their sex in the inflexible fifties. The  Home Economics story points out that "cooking is practically applied chemistry," and dinette  doubles as darkroom when Mike's photographer wife  solves those pesky two-career problems by quitting her  job. Vol. 8 documents the growth of mass advertising and its migration from movie theaters to television. These sweet and subtle precursors to the infomercial include the journey of an animated drop of gasoline  through the fuel-efficient 1935 Chevrolet and "RFD Greenwich Village," a suburban oasis where the modern  villager relaxes in mod duds of all-cotton corduroy. <B> Compu/D 348</B>

See It Now produced in the 50s by CBS, though not television's first public affairs program, was surely its most significant. Hosted by Edward R. Murrow, it was the first public affairs show to use its own film footage instead of newsreel; no interviews were rehearsed and it pioneered the use of field producers, who supervised the filming on location. Its first show on Nov. 18, 1951 marked the first commercial coast-to-coast television broadcast. c1985. 112 min. <B>Video/C 7142</B><br>

<dt><b>Sex, Censorship and the Silver Screen: The 1950s and '60s</b><DD>After World War II, the wholesomeness of American movies faced a tidal wave of change--from outside, as a growing number of provocative foreign films made their way to the U.S., and from within, as car culture flowered and drive-in theaters sprang up across the country. This program documents the period, from the birth of art house cinema to the ascent of boundary-busting American actresses such as Ingrid Bergman, Brigitte Bardot, Sophia Loren, Marilyn Monroe and directors like Marlon Brando and Stanley Kubrick. Studying the shifting moral standards that Hollywood, Italian cinema, and the French New Wave signaled--and which the Catholic Legion of Decency resisted tooth and nail. The 1952 Supreme Court decision granting First Amendment protection to motion pictures is also highlighted.  Dist.: <A HREF="http://www.films.com">Films Media Group.</A>

But, when Willie realizes that he is being manipulated, he veers off on his own to become the darling of the electorate's downtrodden and forgotten hicks. Covering the campaign for a local paper is Jack Burden, whose editorial pieces become so admiring of Willie that he's fired. But, when Stark wins, Burden hires onto the new governor's team as a personal aide. Once in office, Governor Stark antagonizes the state legislature, the oil companies, and the moneyed classes with his share-the-wealth promises to the sweaty masses.
