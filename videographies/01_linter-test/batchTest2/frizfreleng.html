The camouflage troops march by, invisibly. We see training substitutes: wooden guns, cars marked "tank" and, alas, a banner marked "parachute" deployed in mid-jump. More training: aerial games (of tic-tac-toe). The anti-aircraft division has target practice, on an aerial shooting gallery. Finally, in an elaborate process, a general provides firing instructions to a big gun; when it hits his own building, he says, "I'm a baaad general."  <B>Video Disc 165l vhs 999:840</B>

The wolf dresses as a sheep, mingles with the flock, and almost catches a fleeing sheep, but he catches the sheepdog instead. The sheepdog scolds the disguised wolf and throws him into the midst of the flock. A black sheep realizes the deception and runs to the sheepdog to alert him. The black sheep talks like Eddie "Rochester" Anderson calling the sheepdog "Boss" in the same fashion as Rochester used to with Jack Benny. The sheepdog has a hard time finding the disguised wolf among the sheep. He uses a mating horn that fools the wolf into turning into a Pep Le Pew-type Casanova who grabs the sheepdog to romance him. He snaps out of it and flees. The rest of the chase is interrupted by a spoof of the Little Red Riding Hood story.
