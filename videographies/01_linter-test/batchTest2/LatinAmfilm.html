A wealthy American is touring Morocco with his wife. The two become the focus of an international incident also involving a poor Moroccan farmer who is struggling to keep his two young sons in line and his family together. A San Diego nanny, with her employers absent, makes the disastrous decision to take her charges with her to a wedding in Mexico. A deaf-mute Japanese teen tries to deal with a relationship with her father and the world in general that has been upended by the death of her mother. It's about a gun. It's about communication - or the lack of it - both intercultural and intracultural. Raises issues like terrorism and immigration, and is as basic as husbands talking to their wives and parents understanding their children. 143 min.<B> DVD 7293 </B>

<DT><B> Simon  of the Desert (Sim&oacute;n del Desierto) </B>(Mexico, 1965) <DD>Directed by Luis Bu&ntilde;uel.  Cast 	Claudio Brook, Silvia Pinal, Enrique Alvarez Felix, Hortensia Santove&ntilde;a, Francisco Reiguera, Luis Aceves Casta&ntilde;eda, Enrique Garcia Alvarez, Antonio Bravo, Enrique del Castillo, Eduardo MacGregor. Bu&ntilde;uel's bizarre, very off-beat film based loosely on the life of the 5th century saint, Simeon Stylites.  Simon has stood on top of a pillar in the desert for  six years, six weeks and six days. His saintliness and  denial prompts the Devil to try and tempt him in a variety of guises (all of them female). A bizarre conclusion, with a hint of nuclear catastrophe waiting in the wings, rounds things off quite nicely in this off-beat film.  Special DVD features: A Mexican Bu&ntilde;uel (1997), a 50 min. documentary by Emilio Maill&eacute; ; new interview with actress Silvia Pinal ; new and improved subtitle translation; new essay by Michael Wood and a reprint interview with Bu&ntilde;uel.  45 min.  <B>DVD X1133; vhs 999:165</B>

In rural Mexico, during the peasant revolts of the 1970s, Plutarco, his son Genaro and grandson Lucio lead double lives. On the one hand, they are simple country musicians, and on the other they actively support the peasant guerrilla movement against the oppressor government. When the army occupies the village, the rebels are forced to flee and leave their ammunition behind. Making the most of the fact that he looks like an inoffensive violinist, Plutarco has a plan: to recover the munitions hidden in his cornfield. His music enraptures the captain, but he still has to get his hands on the ammunition.
Un bisou pour le monde: In this short film a primary school teacher shows her pupils some daily newspapers. As one of the students wants to look at the copy of Le Monde more carefully, he tears it into pieces. The teacher makes him tape the pieces back together, but the student's choices for where the pieces should go has a surprising effect on "the world."  98 min.  <B>DVD 9839</B>

A Cuban propaganda film first exhibited outside of Cuba and the Soviet Union in 1992.
