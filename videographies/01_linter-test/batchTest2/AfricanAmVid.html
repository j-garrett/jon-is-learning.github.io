<br><DD><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <B>The Downward Spiral.</B> Episode one opens in the 1620s with the introduction of 11 men of African descent and mixed ethnicity into slavery in New Amsterdam. Working side by side with white indentured servants, these men labored to lay the foundations of the Dutch colony that would later become New York. There were no laws defining the limitations imposed on slaves at this point in time. Enslaved people, such as Anthony d'Angola, Emmanuel Driggus, and Frances Driggus could bring suits to court, earn wages, and marry. But in the span of a hundred years, everything changed. By the early 18th century, the trade of African slaves in America was expanding to accommodate an agricultural economy growing in the hands of ambitious planters. After the violent Stono Rebellion many colonies adopted strict "black codes" transforming the social system into one of legal racial oppression.<B>  DVD 3918</B>

Ensuing generations of slaves developed a unique culture that blended elements of African and American life. Episode two follows the paths of several African Americans, including Thomas Jefferson's slave Jupiter, Colonel Tye, Elizabeth Freeman, David Walker, and Mariah Stewart, as they respond to the increasingly restrictive system of slavery. At the core of this episode is the Revolutionary War, an event which reveals the contradictions of a nation seeking independence while simultaneously denying freedom to its black citizens. <B>DVD 3919</B>








<br><DD><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <B>Seeds of Destruction.</B> One by one the Northern states, led by Vermont in 1777, adopted laws to abolish and phase out slavery. Simultaneously, slavery in the Southern United States entered the period of its greatest expansion. Episode three, which starts at the beginning of the 1800s, examines slavery's increasing divisiveness in America as the nation develops westward and cotton replaces tobacco as the country's most valuable crop. The episode weaves national events through the personal histories of three African American slaves -- Harriet Jacobs, Solomon Northup and Louis Hughes -- who not only managed to escape bondage, but also exposed the horrific realities of the slave experience in autobiographical narratives. These and other stories of physical, psychological, and sexual exploitation fed the fires of a reinvigorated abolitionist movement. With a diverse membership comprised of men and women, blacks and whites, and led by figures including Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, and Amy Post, abolitionist sentiment gathered strength in the North, contributing to the widening fissure and imminent break-up of the nation. <B>DVD 3920</B>
<br><DD><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <B>The Challenge of Freedom.</B>  Looks at Civil War and Reconstruction through the experiences of South Carolina slave Robert Smalls. It chronicles Smalls' daring escape to freedom, his military service, and his tenure as a congressman after the war. As the events of Smalls' life unfold, the complexities of this period in American history are revealed. The episode shows the transformation of the war from a struggle for union to a battle over slavery. It examines the black contribution to the war effort and traces the gains and losses of newly freed African Americans during Reconstruction. The 13th amendment abolished slavery in 1865, the 14th and 15th amendments guaranteed black civil rights, and the Freedmen's Bureau offered aid to former slaves throughout the 1870s. Yet simultaneously, the formation of militant groups, such as the Ku Klux Klan threatened the future of racial equality and segregation laws began to appear across the country. Slavery's eradication had not brought an end to black oppression.  <B>DVD 3921</B>



<br><dt><b> A Son of Africa.</b> <dd>A docudrama based on the book, The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Oloudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vaasa the African, which was the first influential slave  autobiography. When it was published in 1789, it fueled a growing anti-slavery movement in the U.S. and England. This production employs dramatic reconstruction, archival material and interviews with scholars. Equiano's narrative begins in the West African village where he was kidnapped into slavery in 1756. He was shipped to a Virginia plantation and then later sold again to a British naval officer. Here he learned to read and write, became a skilled trader, eventually bought his freedom and married into English society where he became a leading abolitionist. 1996.  28 min. <B>DVD 3053; also VHS Video/C 4464</B><br>

Using the life and work of Langston Hughes during the jazz/blues infused Harlem Renaissance of the 1920's, the film weaves together the poetry of Hughes and Essex Hempill, music, sylized dramatic sequences and archival material in a celebration of gay desire and a testament to contemporary society's attempt to shatter multiple identitites."

<br><dt><b>The "New Negro" Arts Movement </b> (Art: Transatlantic Modernism)  <dd>   Between WWI and WWII nearly 2 million blacks migrated to   Harlem making it an exciting and culturally rich   neighborhood.

Here Professor   Corn shows numerous examples of African-Americans   being "in vogue" in the 20's -- one example is famed   dancer Josephine Baker, whose high moment of fame in   Paris -- "Revue Negre" made her a symbol of the "new   woman."  1998. 60 min. <B>Video/C 7276</B>

<dt><b>761st, The Story of the Black Panther Tank Battalion</b><DD>	The 761st Tank Battalion, the first unit to enlist African-American soldiers to operate armored vehicles was activated on April 1, 1942, at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana and deployed to Europe, landing at Omaha Beach in France on October 10, 1944. Over the course of 183 days of continuous fighting (including action in the Battle of the Bulge) the "Black Panthers" became the first African-American armored unit to enter combat. With the motto "Come Out Fighting!" they faced racism at home and death overseas in a war for many freedoms they did not enjoy in America.  Directed by Pete Chatmon. 200-?  72 min. <B>DVD X5625 </B>

<br><i><b>Challenge to democracy: The Internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II</b> </i>is here explained according to the Government's point of view. <i><b>Close harmony</b></i>: Attempts to show the need for good labor/management relations in the U.S. arms industry, resorting to the "step 'n fetch it" stereotype of Black Americans. <i><b>Farmer Henry Browne</b></i>: Shows how a black Georgian farmer does his part for the war, with his farm, his family and the service of his Tuskegee fighter pilot eldest son. <i><b>Japanese relocation</b></i>: A propaganda film designed to show the co-operation and satisfaction of the Japanese American internees in terms of being relocated, re-employed, re-educated and interned. <b><i> Negro colleges in wartime</i></b>: An exposition of the teaching and training of Black Americans for war, science, industry, agriculture, husbandry, meteorology, medicine, engineering and technical trades at black colleges. 57 min.<B> DVD 2253</B><br>




<br><dt><b>From Swastika to Jim Crow</b><dd>Before and during the Second World War Jewish scholars  who escaped Nazi Germany and immigrated to the U.S. faced anti-Semitism at major universities and a public distrust of foreigners, so a significant number secured teaching positions at historically Black colleges in the South.

This is a story of two cultures, each sharing a burden of oppression, brought together by the tragic  circumstances of war. 1999. 57 min. <B>Video/C 7866</B><br>
