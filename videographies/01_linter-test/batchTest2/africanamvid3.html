<B>Black Hollywood</B>  Does the increasing success of African-Americans as film actors, directors, and producers signal a genuine shift in the role of race and the influence of people of color in the movie business? In this program, Dr. Henry Louis Gates, Jr. journeys to the West Coast and asks whether Hollywood remains institutionally racist or whether it is becoming increasingly color-blind in pursuit of the box office dollar. Interviewees include Chris Tucker, Samuel L. Jackson, Alicia Keys, Quincy Jones, Nia Long, Don Cheadle, and John Singleton.  56 min.

<br><DD><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border=0><B>Ebony Towers</B> The existence of a small group of African-Americans at the heart of the corporate and political establishment is something that, just two decades ago, seemed unimaginable.

<br><dt><b>America in Black and White. Racial Profiling and Law Enforcement  </b><dd>For many African-Americans, simply having dark skin seems to be grounds for being pulled over by police and searched for drugs.

<br><dt><b>Black Is - Black Ain't: A Personal Journey Through Black Identity</b>  <dd> American culture has stereotyped black Americans for centuries. Equally devastating, the late Marlon Riggs argued, have been the definitions of "blackness" African Americans impose upon one another which contain and reduce the black experience. In this film, Riggs meets a cross-section of African Americans grappling with the paradox of numerous, often contradictory definitions of blackness. He shows many who have felt uncomfortable and even silenced within the race because their complexion, class, sexuality, gender, or speech has rendered them "not black enough," or conversely, "too black." The film scrutinizes the identification of "blackness" with masculinity as well as sexism, patriarchy and homophobia in black America. 1995. 88 min.  <B>DVD 3036; also VHS Video/C 3779</B>

<dt><b>Blacking Up: Hip-hop's Remix of Race and Identity</b><dd>This documentary examines the popularity of hip-hop among America's white youth and asks whether white identification is rooted in admiration and a desire to transcend race or if it is merely a new chapter in the long continuum of stereotyping, mimicry and cultural appropriation. Does it reflect a new face of racial understanding in white America or does it reinforce an ugly history? Against the unique backdrop of american popular music, the film explores racial identity in the United States. The film draws parallels between the white hip-hop fan and previous incarnations of white appropriation from blackface performer Al Jolson to mainstream artists like Elvis Presley, the Rolling Stones and Eminem. It interweaves portraits of white hip-hop artists and fans with insightful commentary by African American cultural critics.  2010

<br><dt><b> Didn't We Ramble On.</b><dd> Film examines how West African people have passed down their rites and spiritual fervor, generation by generation, through the black marching band.  As long as 700 years ago, the Yaruba's had musicalprocessions at funerals. By the 17th century, African musicians were seen in Turkish marching bands and admired and copied by the monarchs of Europe.  During both World Wars black military bands played a major role in maintaining troop morale. In the U.S. today, the tradition of the black marching band continues on the football fields as exemplified by the Forida A&M Marching Band.  In New Orleans today, a jazz procession, a direct cultural link to the Yoruba ceremony of 700 years ago, is an integral part of the Afro-American funeral observance.

<br><dt><b>A Portrait of Jason.</b><dd>"Filmed in one wild night at New York’s Chelsea Hotel, Shirley Clarke’s explosive Portrait of Jason is a landmark of nonfiction film – the combination of a visionary director, a complex and enigmatic subject, and a moment of new cinematic and social possibilities.

Jason Holliday is an unapologetically gay cabaret performer with charisma to spare, a knack for drama, and a life that’s provided him with plenty of stories to tell – about racism, homophobia, parental abuse, show business, drugs, sex, prostitution, the law, and whatever else he can think of while the cameras are rolling. Jason is endlessly entertaining – he sings, tells his stories, performs, breaks down, gets back up, keeps going. But he is as elusive as he is talented, and the more intimate the details he reveals, the less clear his "identity" becomes. As the night goes on he plays an increasingly intense game of cat-and-mouse with the filmmakers, who can be heard egging him on from behind the camera. The climax of the film is a shocking attempt by the crew to break through the layers of Jason's charisma to reveal the person underneath."
