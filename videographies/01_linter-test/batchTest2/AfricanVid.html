<br><dt><b><a NAME="chief">Chief! La Tete Dans les Nuages(Head in the Clouds)</a></b>   <dd>    Chef!: The filmmaker locates the roots of Africa's authoritarian regimes in the patriarchal family,  reinforced by traditional kingship and the colonial experience. He made a visit to his ancestral village, Bandjoun, in the Ghomala speaking region of Western Cameroon, where he planned to film dances dedicating a monument to King Kamga Joseph II, the filmmakers' great grand uncle, but the ceremony soon turned into a celebration of one-man rule, in particular Cameroonian President Paul Biya's.<br> La tete dans les nuages: Teno investigates the ties between unaccountable government and an unproductive economy. The government controlled formal sector, like its colonial predecessor, is essentially parasitical. An informal sector has emerged parallel to it which increasingly supplies the daily subsistence needs of  the people. Irene, for example, works at the Ministry of Education for an unreliable and inadequate salary; she earns the money she needs to eat from selling beignets in the market. She also belongs to a tontine or "credit union" which offers its members a pool of capital to draw on for business ventures. Such clubs, ubiquitous among African market women, help fill the economic and social vacuum left by the decay of traditional society and the unresponsiveness of the formal banking sector. 1999. 96 min.

Only a handful of aid agencies continue to work there, and the amount of aid it gets is pitiful compared to other sub-Saharan countries. In 2003, it received just $12.9 USD per person. President Francois Bozize confirms that health is the country's top priority.

<br><dt><b>Black Gold </b><dd>After oil, coffee is the most actively traded commodity in the world with $80 billion in retail sales. But for every $3 cup of coffee, a coffee farmer receives only 3 cents. Most of the money goes to the middlemen, especially the four giant conglomerates which control the coffee market. Tracing the path of the coffee consumed each day to the farmers who produce the beans, Black Gold asks us to 'wake up and smell the coffee', to face the unjust conditions under which our favorite drink is produced and to decide what we can do about it. In particular, It follows Tadesse Meskela as he tries to get a living wage for the 70,000 Ethiopian coffee farmers he represents.

These clichs of nature films ignore a key landscape feature: villagers just off-camera who endure the dangers and costs of living with wild animals.
