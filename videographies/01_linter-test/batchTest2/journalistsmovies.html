<br><dt><b>Capote</b> (2005)<DD>Directed by Bennett Miller. Cast: Philip Seymour Hoffman, Catherine Keener, Clifton Collins, Jr., Bruce Greenwood, Bob Balaban, Mark Pellegrino, Chris Cooper. Based on true events. Truman Capote was a popular writer for <I>The New Yorker</I>. In 1959, when he learns about the horrific and senseless murder of a family of four in Halcomb, Kansas, Capote and his partner, Harper Lee, travel to the town to do research for an article. However, as Capote digs deeper into the story, he is inspired to expand the project into what would be his greatest work, "In Cold Blood." He arranges extensive interviews with the prisoners, especially with Perry Smith. However, his feelings of compassion for Perry conflict with his need for closure for his book which only an execution can provide. That conflict and the mixed motives for both interviewer and subject make for a troubling experience that produced an literary account that redefined modern non-fiction. 114 min. <B>DVD 5329</B>

Takes place in the 1950's America, during the early days of broadcast journalism. It chronicles the real-life conflict between television newsman Edward R.

With a desire to report the facts and enlighten the public, Murrow, and his dedicated staff - headed by his producer Fred Friendly and Joe Wershba in the CBS newsroom - defy corporate and sponsorship pressures to examine the lies and scaremongering tactics perpetrated by McCarthy during his communist 'witch-hunts'.

"Bedridden Amos Kyne is owner and manager of media conglomerate Kyne Enterprises. Upon Amos' death, his son, the ineffective Walter Kyne, takes control of the business. Not wanting to do any of the work but retain the glory, Walter creates a new position - Executive Director - that person who effectively will become head of the organization. The heads of the three primary arms of the business - John Day Griffith (newspaper), Mark Loving (wire service) and Harry Kritzer (photographic service) - are those in line for the job, each who will do whatever he needs to for the appointment. Walter has decided that whoever of the three solves and reports the Lipstick Killings first will get the position. The Lipstick Killings are the murders of young women, the murderer who scrawls a note in lipstick at the murder scene after the fact. Pulitzer Prize winning author and reporter Edward Mobley is seen by most to be the real brains of the organization, although he has no desire for the top job. Although he initially will not get into the internal fight for the job, Ed, who has connections to the police department and has his own thoughts as to the psychological profile of the killer, decides to assist his old friend, John Griffith, in solving the case. In their quest, those involved do not hesitate to use the women in their lives - namely Nancy Liggett (Ed's fianc&eacute;e and Mark's secretary), Dorothy Kyne (Walter's wife), and Women's Affairs columnist Mildred Donner - in whatever manner they can."
