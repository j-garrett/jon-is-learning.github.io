Directed by Charles Ferguson.<BR> An insider's look at the decisions that led to the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq and the handling of the occupation.

They are the "Silver Belles," five women aged 84 to 96.  In their heyday they worked at some of Harlem's most prestigious haunts, performing with legendary band leaders like Cab Calloway, Jimmie Lunceford and Duke Ellington. They met in the 1930's as chorus dancers at the Apollo and the Cotton Club. When the big band era ended, and with it the need for show dancers, they all went into other work. They regrouped in 1985, put their shoes back on and — sassy as they ever were — are still performing regularly.  They may not kick as high, but they are hip-swaying and show-biz savvy.  These women will disrupt any notions you have of old age.

<br><DT><B>Shipbreakers</B><BR>

Directed by Michael Kot.<BR> For the past two decades more than 7,000 rusting hulks of the world's largest ships have been driven onto the remote beaches off the Arabian Sea to be dismantled for scrap by hand, piece by piece. Sold for scrap, the ship owners rarely bother to abide by the U.N. Basel Convention which bans shipments of transboundary waste. A sign reading "Safety Is Our Motto" may hang over the gateway, but the workers have another, more telling slogan: "A ship a day, a death a day."
One worker a day, on average, dies on the job, evaporated in explosions, crushed by falling steel, cut in half by cables or broken up from falls. Of the remainder, one in four will contract cancers caused by asbestos, PCBs and other toxic substances.
Shipbreakers vividly captures both the haunting beauty of the ships and the deplorable conditions of the workers --- in an unforgettable portrayal where Third World ingenuity meets 21st century global economics.
