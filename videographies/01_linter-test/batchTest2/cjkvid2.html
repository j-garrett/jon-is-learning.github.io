<dt><b>731: Two Versions of Hell</b><DD>
Version 1: The doorway to hell (15 min.) -- Version 2: War is hell (12 min.)
Documentary about Unit 731, Japan's secret World War II biological and chemical weapons facility in the Chinese town of Harbin where biological weapons were developed during the Japanese Occupation. The film uses the same footage as seen from two points of view. The first half gives the perspective of the Chinese government and describes the horrors and atrocities that occurred during World War II at the facility. The second half, using almost the exact same footage, describes Unit 731 from the Japanese revisionist perspective which is largely supported by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in Japan. Although its cruel experiments on living people produced thousands of casualties, this activity is still denied by a number of Japanese historians and politicians. A film by James T. Hong.  2007.  <B>DVD X351</B>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border=0> <b>Korean War, Part 1:   The Making of a Bloodbath.</b>   When North Korea invaded South  Korea on June 25, 1950, a disastrously downsized, Post-WWII American military acted swiftly to stop this first instance of armed Communist aggression but the U.N. contingent soon found itself thrown back into disarray. Bottled up with their backs to the sea at Pusan, America and her allies now faced a humiliating evacuation. <B>Video/C 6636</B>

 <dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border=0> <b>Korean War, Part 2:    Triumph to Tragedy</b>   With the U.N. forces on the verge of being pushed into the sea at Pusan, victory was within the grasp of the surrounding North Korean army, but General Douglas MacArthur executed a high-risk amphibious landing at Inchon. Within months, MacArthur's men would drive the North Koreans almost to the Chinese border. But their victory would turn to devastating defeat, as a huge wave of Chinese troops took the U.N. contingent by surprise, forcing a
retreat back into South Korea. <B>Video/C 6637</B>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border=0> <b>Korean War, Part 3:   Retreat from Hell.</b>   Nearly overrun by the hordes of Chinese troops pouring across the Yalu River, American forces experienced defeats at the Chosin Reservoir and the evacuation of forces from the port of Hungnam. By December of 1950, the communists had recaptured the North Korean capital, Pynongyang; a month later, the southern capital of Seoul also fell. Now, with the war becoming increasingly costly for both sides, the two adversaries dug in and consolidated their forces at the 38th Parallel.  <B>Video/C 6638</B>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10" border=0> <b>Korean War, Part 4:   Bitter Standoff.</b>  As American casualties mounted, U.S. President Harry Truman came under increasing military and political pressure finally resulting in MacArthur's dismissal and the arrival of General Matthew Ridgway. After retaking Seoul the U.N. forces confronted the re-grouped enemy in the biggest battle of the war. But by now, U.S. policy had shifted from liberation to containing the communists at the 38th   parallel. The war raged on until the armistice of July, 1953, a tenuous unstable cease-fire that continues to flare into violence even today. <B>Video/C 6639</B><br>

<br><dt><b>The Red Chapel (Det r&oslash;de kapel)</b> <dd>A one-of-a-kind documentary that reveals the injustices of North Korea with a hilariously dark wit ... a trio of Danish comedians, who call themselves "The Red Chapel", pretend to be regime sympathizers and mount an absurd variety show in Pyongyang.

descent:  bulky, tattooed, guitar-banging hipster Simon Jul, and his
spiky-haired cohort Jacob Nossell, who has cerebral palsy and occasionally uses a wheelchair. Constantly shadowed by their guide, Mrs. Pak, they fake allegiance to Kim Jong-il and hope for "One Korea." Only Jacob is allowed to speak his mind. Suffering from cerebral palsy, his halting speech is impossible to translate, so he insults his socialist hosts and receives smiles in return ... an unconventional, hilarious and damning peek into a totalitarian nightmare.  Directed by Mads Br&uuml;gger. 2009. 88 min. <B>DVD X5974</B>
