<br><dt><b>Agent Yellow: Not a Chinaman's Chance</b><dd>This film focuses on the ambiguous role forced upon Chinese scientists and engineers who have contributed significantly to American military research while still remaining largely invisible, except when singled out for disloyalty, as in the recent case of Wen Ho Lee, or the 1950's McCarthy Era case of Hsue-Shen Tsien. It explores the pervasive American perception of China in either/or terms: either a sinister threat or a potential partner, and explores how these attitudes have led to a wariness about Chinese involvement in U.S. military technology.
