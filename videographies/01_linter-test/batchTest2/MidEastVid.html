<br><dt><b>[Said, Edward] Edward Said in Lecture: the Myth of the "Clash of Civilizations"</b> (<i>Race and Diversity Series</i>)
<dd>In this lecture delivered at the University of Massachusetts, Edward Said in a critique of the groundbreaking book by Samuel Huntington takes aim at one of the central tenents of recent foreign policy thinking - that conflicts between different and clashing "civilizations" (Western, Islamic, Confucian) characterize the contemporary world. Said argues that collapsing complex, diverse and contradictory groups of people into vast, simplistic abstractions has disastrous consequences. Presenting instead a vision of the "coexistence" of difference, Said concludes with the fundamental challenge that faces humanity at the turn of the millennium. 55 min. 1998.  <B>DVD 4915' vhs Video/C 5801</B><br>

This program charts the rise of the Arab empire from its roots in the long-standing rivalry between the Byzantines and the Sassanids. Examines the dual role of Mecca as a place of worship and as a center for trade, the life of Muhammad and the birth of Islam, the rapid expansion of Arabia at the expense of Byzantium and the Sassanid kingdom, and the internecine struggle between Arab factions that led to the founding of the Umayyad dynasty. 26 min. <B>Video/C 8025 </B>

With it, Islam saw the birth of a multiethnic concept of power, in which both Arab and non-Arab Muslims could share authority. This program presents the Abbasid Caliphate at its peak, enthroned in its prestigious capital city: Baghdad. The defining project of Caliph al-Ma'amun, the translation by an army of clerks of all the ancient writings his emissaries could procure is spotlighted--an achievement that set the stage for an eventual showdown between religious and secular scholars. 27 min. <B>Video/C 8026 </B>

Special attention is given to the prosperous reign of Abdel Rahman III and the flowering of a Muslim culture that respectfully welcomed the contributions of Christians and Jews alike. 27 min. <B>Video/C 8027 </B>

This program captures what it was like to be a pilgrim in a caravan bound for Mecca, an official carrying out the Caliph's orders, a scholar seeking knowledge, a merchant in search of new markets, and an explorer charting the seas. Some of the era's most memorable personalities --mathematician al-Khuwarizmi, the chronicler Abul Hasan Ali al Mas'udi, the cartographer Abu al-Qasim Muhammad ibn Hawqal -- are profiled. 26 min. <B>Video/C 8028</B>

What was it like to live in the Arab cities of the Abbasid dynasty, grand oases of refinement and innovation? This program describes key centers of the Muslim town, including the mosque and the souk, and the roles of the prince, the doctors of the law, and the leaders of the various social groups in keeping order within the community. 26 min. <B>Video/C 8029 </B>

This program focuses on the remarkable cultural contributions of Ziryab, a talented young musician who fled the East for Andalusia and became the era's preeminent arbiter of style and taste. After creating a popular new form of music, he went on to radically  reshape Arab high society, inventing new fashions and hairstyles, introducing fine dining, and creating a thriving market for all manner of luxury goods. 27 min. <B>Video/C 8030 </B>

This program reveals the development in the Islamic Empire of the Indo-Arabic decimal system, algebra, algorithms and the refinement of the science of optics and the Ptolemaic model of the solar system. The application of astronomy to sacred ends, such as accurately fixing the time for prayers, the direction of Mecca, and the start of Ramadan, is also considered. 26  min. <B>Video/C 8032 </B>

This program scrutinizes the wonderfully audacious tale of Scheherezade and what it tells the attentive reader about the dreams of Arab men and women during the empire's golden age. Recurring themes such as hunger for adventure and a desire to be free from tradition are explored, as well as a conception of power that glorifies self-control and disparages violence. 27  min. <B>Video/C 8033 </B>

This program studies the codification of Islamic law and assimilation of non-Arab texts--and the ensuing competition between the ulema, or doctors of the law, and the philosophers, who saw reason as an equal to divine enlightenment. The contributions of key figures, including the Caliph al-Maamun, Yaqub ibn Ishaq al-Kindi, Abu al-Nasr al-Farabi, Avicenna, Muhammad ibn Tufayl, and Averroes, are also examined. 26  min. <B>Video/C 8034</B>

The rise of feudalism and papal authority, the gradual defeat of the Muslim rulers in Spain, the Seljuk ursurpation of Abbisid power in the Near East, and the Crudades are explained, along with the concerted efforts of Catholic authorities to translate the vast libraries of Arab scientific and philosophical texts. 26  min. <B>Video/C 8035 </B>

And why, after assimilating it, did Europeans distance themselves from its formulators? This program seeks to understand the religious climate of the late Middle Ages, in which universities and madrassas became centers of power and models for evolving sociopolitical systems.  The potentially heretical nature of philosophy is also analyzed--in Islamic lands the djinni of intellectuality was put back in the bottle, but in Christendom it escaped the control of those who used it, paving the way for Renaissance humanism. 27 min. <B>Video/C 8036</B><br>

<br><dt><B>All Restrictions End </B><DD>In the early days of the Iranian revolution, anyone with press lines on his trousers would be dismissed from work. How can one say his prayers to Allah without breaking his trousers' press lines?" This and other reflections on Islam and clothing characterize this thought-provoking, free-form documentary. With clothing as the leitmotif, the filmmaker provides the history of Iran, the country of his birth, where beheadings and hangings are commonplace occurrences. It is an endless series of confrontations between groups that all want something different for their country. Clothing remains the point of departure in the stories about Iran, a land that has tottered for centuries between East and West, the present and the past, freedom and repression. In Baudelaire's words, fashion is the mirror of the times, and that makes it a great metaphor for what is going on in a country.  The film is structured like a collage, interweaving archival footage from Iranian cinema, imagery from various stylistic epochs in the history of Persian painting, graphics from the period of the Islamic Revolution, and works provided by various artists. Directed and edited by Reza Haeri. 2009. 33 min.

<br><dt><b>Shi'ism: Awaiting the Hidden Imam.  </b><dd>Adherents of Shi'ism comprise less that ten percent of the more than one billion Muslims in the world today, but ever since the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, with its indelible images of blindfolded hostages seized at the American Embassy in Tehran, Shi'ism has been perceived by most Westerners as a religious sect characterized by violence and fanaticism. The ouster of Saddam Hussein in 2003 and the continuing U.S. occupation of Iraq have led to a resurgence of Shia political activity after decades of oppression by Saddam's Sunni-dominated regime, providing Shi?ism with new found political influence as well as an opportunity to improve its image. This film discusses the history of Shi'ism, its origins, mythology of martyrdom, the centuries of persecution and discrimination of Shi'ism as a minority faith, and its basic tenets including the belief in the twelfth, or 'hidden' Imam, who will appear on the Last Day as the Mahdi. Filmed in Iran, Lebanon and Iraq, this film interweaves contemporary and historical footage, and introduces Muslim scholars, philosophers, writers, politicians and religious leaders discussing a wide range of issues. A film by Said Bakhtaoui and Mohammad Ballout.  2005.  53 min.   <B>Video/C 1075</B>

<br><dt><b>Imperial Grand Strategy: The Conquest of Iraq and the Assault on Democracy.</b> <dd><B>Imperial Grand Strategy</B>: "Chomsky takes on the war in Iraq cutting through the ideological fog that surrounds the invasion and occupation, laying waste to the U.S. government's justifications for them. In the process, he uncovers the real motivations behind U.S. military aggression: a global imperial plan put in place long before Iraq --and that will extend far into the future, unless we do something about it."
<B>The Assault on Freedom and Democracy</B>: Chomsky "moves from broad, geo-political concerns to the sort of authoritarian societies needed "on the ground" for such imperial strategies to work. Discussing the Patriot Acts (1 & 2) at home and a long and disgraceful U.S. history of "democracy-building" abroad, Chomsky highlights the vast difference between noble rhetoric and our consistent military and economic support for dictators and thugs."

<br><dt><b>No End In Sight</b><dd>An insider's look at the decisions that led to the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq and the handling of the occupation. Based on over 200 hours of footage, the film provides a candid retelling of the events following the fall of Baghdad in 2003 by high ranking officals, as well as Iraqi civilians, American soldiers and prominent analysts. Examines the manner in which the principal errors of U.S. policy--the use of insufficient troop levels, allowing the looting of Baghdad, the purging of professionals from the Iraqi government and the disbanding of the Iraqi military--largely created the insurgency and chaos that engulf Iraq today.  Producer/director, Charles Ferguson. 2007. 102 min.  <B>DVD 9128</B>

<br><dt><b>119 Bullets + Three.  </b><dd> The November 4, 1995 assassination of Israel Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin riveted the world's attention on the conflict between Israel's religious and secular Jews over the essence of Zionism and the future of Israel's cultural and political identity.  Will the nation be torn apart by zealots? Two filmakers journey from Tel Aviv to Hebron, where the model of a second Israel already exists, interviewing jews, some of them fanatic religious idealists, concerning the incendiary issues that will determine the future of  Israel...and the Middle East.  1995.   61 min.  <B>Video/C 4624</B><br>

<br><dt><b>[Aljafari, Kamal] The films of Kamal Aljafari</b><DD>Contents: 	Port of memory (2009, 62 min.) -- The Roof (2006, 61 min.) -- Balconies (2009, 11 min.) -- Visit Iraq (2006, 26 min.).  The haunting films of Kamal Aljafari mix documentary, fiction and personal memoir to render complex portraits of the Palestinian communities in Ramleh and Jaffa, now part of Israel. While providing a rare look at the everyday lives of Palestinian Israelis, the films are more than simply sociopolitical treatises of often-overlooked communities and neighborhoods in danger of dissolving. Aljafari instead astutely balances fiction and nonfiction to capture the fragile rhythms of lives lived in a kind of permanent displacement and the strange limbo of neighborhoods subtly yet inexorably transforming.
	<B>Port of Memory </B>: The history of the town of Jaffa, a thriving port city now part of Tel Aviv, provides the background for Aljafari's most recent film, centering on his mother's family at risk of eviction if they can't find proof that the house they have lived in for decades belongs to them. Their predicament is rendered with Aljafari's usual subtlety, as well as deadpan humor and dark wit. This skeletal narrative provides the scaffolding for a portrait of life in what was once a bustling neighborhood that was nearly emptied by fighting during the establishment of the state of Israel, and then suffered decades of official neglect.
	<B>The Roof</B> : This deceptively quiet film presents a portrait of Aljafari's family in Ramleh and Jaffa that hovers between documentary and cinematic memoir, guided by a nimble camera moving calmly but ceaselessly around the rooms of homes inhabited, damaged and ruined. The title refers to the roof missing from the house where Aljafari's family resettled in 1948, a home unfinished, an incomplete construction project.
	<B>Balconies </B>: An experimental meditation focusing on the deteriorating and unfinished balconies in Palestine.
	<B>Visit Iraq</B> : A humorous look at how Geneva residents imagine and project clichés on the recently abandoned office of Iraqi Airlines.  159 min. <B>DVD X5823</B>

<br><dt><b> Arena of Murder</b><dd> Amos Gitai investigates the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin three weeks after the event.

Field Diary (Yoman sadeh)Field Diary: Shot in the occupied territories before and during the Isaraeli invasion of Lebanon, the film consists of about 50 sequence shots, mostly filmed from a moving car. Like an endless traveling shot, the film weaves hypnotically through occupied zones, occasionally slowing down or pausing to underscore a moment. The film's view of the occupation was controversial in Israel, leading to Gitai's decade-long exile from his native country.

<br><dt><b>Awodah  </b><dd> Without narration, this film documents the pioneering  labors of early Jewish settlers in Palestine in the 1930s as they build a new homeland.

<br><dt><b>Children of the Sun. </b><dd>Conceived as a utopian refuge, kibbutz were collective communities in which children were raised to become the new face of the Jewish people. In the kibbutz, children were offered only limited contact with their parents; completely oblivious to the bold experiment in which they were the primary test subjects. They were cared for by nannies, and slept together in a separate cottage designed specifically for them. As a result the children became their own family, a new breed that placed little value on material possessions while immersing themselves in physical labor and strict ideology.

<br><dt><b>Hajj: Drinking from the Stream.</b><dd>A film by Claire Dannenbaum.

While Hajj is not an anthropological film per se, it attempts to counter mainstream ethnographic preoccupation with esoteric or ritual activity (special occasions and "public: culture typically carried out by/for men) by looking at "non-events," or the performative elements in women's domestic tasks. Using footage of village life and women at work, the film addresses the multiple meanings behind women's domestic labor, and the potential social power derived from the marginalized activity of home."

Ultimately, an evocation of references that lead to and hover about the evil eye, the film suggests the inherent complexity of ethnographic documents portraying another culture."

<br><dt><b>Hajj: Drinking from the Stream.</b><dd>A film by Claire Dannenbaum.

This project explores the notion of performance in everyday life--forms of activity which would otherwise be censurable, dangerous, or threatening--in the context of a gender-segregated and patriarchal culture.  While Hajj is not an anthropological film per se, it attempts to counter mainstream ethnographic preoccupation with esoteric or ritual activity (special occasions and "public: culture typically carried out by/for men) by looking at "non-events," or the performative elements in women's domestic tasks. Using footage of village life and women at work, the film addresses the multiple meanings behind women's domestic labor, and the potential social power derived from the marginalized activity of home."
