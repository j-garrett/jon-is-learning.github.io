<br><dt><b>American President  </b> <dd>2000.  60 min. each installment

<br><dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10">  <b>Part l:  Matter of Destiny: Family Ties </b>  The last thing that the Founding Fathers envisioned was a hereditary chief executive. Yet, power inevitably passes from generation to generation and several families have returned to the White house. Focusing on John Q. Adams, Benjamin Harrison, Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy, part 1 reveals both the blessings and the curses of inherited power.  <B>Video/C 7161</B><br>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>Part 2:  Matter of Destiny: Happenstance.</b>   Nearly one in five American presidents has died in office. The vice presidents who succeeded them were often chosen for the ticket less because they were equal to the task than because they provided some electoral advantage. Focusing on John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Andrew Jackson, Chester Arthur and Harry Truman, part 2 looks at what happens when such a man takes office -- frequently facing widespread conviction that he is unworthy. <B>Video/C 7161</B> <br>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>Part 3: Politics and the Presidency: an Independent Cast of Mind</b>  Is an independent mind the best approach to the presidency? The four men profiled in this segment took little account of political affiliation, becoming presidents, in essence without being politicians. Taken together, they present a cautionary tale: all had difficult presidencies, and neither of the two who sought a second term was re-elected. This segment profiles the careers of J. Adams, Taylor, Hayes, and Carter. <B>Video/C 7162</B>  <br>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>Part  4: Politics and the Presidency: The Professional Politician</b>   In our nation's early years, taking part in political affairs was considered a duty and an honor, but not a way of life. It was not long, however, before the professional politicians, and the parties they represented, began to find their way to the White House. While the skills necessary for political success can be helpful to a president, they do not guarantee success. This segment profiles the careers of Van Buren, Buchanan, Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson. <B>Video/C 7162</B> <br>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>Part  5: Executive Vision: The American</b>  Americans have come to expect that their presidents will bring to the office a particularly strong sense of national mission. The four presidents chronicled here may have understood the character of America in different ways, but in all cases a belief that there was a distinctly American way of doing things guided their decisions. This segment profiles the careers of Jefferson, Coolidge, Hoover and Reagan. <B>Video/C 7163</B> <br>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>Part  6:   Executive Vision: The World Stage</b>    The president has no greater responsibility than representing the nation on the world stage. These four men engaged in this task at critical times in American national history and their achievements on the world stage stand as their most durable legacy. This segment profiles the careers of Monroe, McKinley, Wilson and Bush. <B> Video/C 7163</B> <br>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>Part  7:  The Candidate: The Heroic Posture </b>   From the beginning, the presidential office has beckoned to national heroes renowned for their selfless service to their country. This affinity is especially strong for men of military fame, for the president is formally the commander-in-chief as well as symbolically the steward of the national interest. This segment profiles the careers of Washington, W. H. Harrison, Grant, and Eisenhower.  <B>Video/C 7164</B><br>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>Part  8:  The Candidate:  Compromise Choices </b>  With the rise of political parties  came the dawn of political compromise: nominees were selected because they were less offensive to some voters than those who might have been the best candidates. Two of the men profiled in this segment found the presidency beyond their abilities, while two proved themselves worthy of having been called to the highest office in the land. This segment profiles the  careers of Pierce, Garfield, Harding and Ford. <B>  Video/C 7164</B> <br>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>Part  9:  An Office and its Powers: Expanding Power </b>   Though the powers of the presidency have expanded with the growth of the nation, the process has been anything but smooth. These four presidencies are benchmarks in the development of executive power. Three stretched the office to its limits; the fourth over-stepped those limits and brought on a new era of presidential weakness. This segment profiles the careers of Jackson, Cleveland, T. Roosevelt and Nixon. <B>Video/C 7165</B> <br>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>Part  10:  An Office and its Powers:The Balance of Power </b>   The American presidency was conceived as one part of a larger system of institutions, and its effectiveness rests in part upon a good measure of cooperation among the branches. This episode examines presidential leadership in eras of an increasingly divided government. The presidents presented here suggest four different conceptions of governance within a constitutionally structured balancing act. This segment profiles the careers of Madison, Polk,Taft and Clinton. <B>Video/C 7165</B>


<br><dt><b>The American Ruling Class: A Dramatic-documentary-musical </b><dd>A dramatic, musical, documentary satire on class in America that attempts to answer the question 'Who rules America?' Is there an American ruling class, and if so, how do you join? Two hapless Yale grads embark on a star-studded journey of meetings with America's establishment to unearth some uncomfortable answers and find out the truth about what the future really holds for them.   Featuring: Robert B. Altman, James A. Baker III, Bill Bradley, Harold Brown, Hodding Carter III, William T. Coleman, Jr., Walter Cronkite, Barbara Ehrenreich, Vartan Gregorian, Doug Henwood, Mike Medavoy, Joseph S. Nye, Jr., John Perkins, (a.k.a., the economic hit-man), Pete Seeger, Lawrence H. Summers, Arthur O. Sulzberger, Jr., William Howard Taft IV, the late Kurt Vonnegut and Howard Zinn.

<br><dt><b>America's War on Poverty.</b><dd><br>
<br>


<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> Vol 1:  <b>In This Affluent Society. </b> In the early 1960s, hundreds of Kentucky coal miners are displaced by machines and strike out at their former employers.  Millions of others displaced by machines across Appalachia and the rural South head  north to begin a new life in Chicago, where they face overcrowded tenements and schools, and the familiar inequities of segregation.  This program recounts these stories of desperation and hope and explores the origins of the federal government's war on poverty and how attitudes toward race and faith in the accessibility of the American dream shape the battle  plans for the nation's greatest effort to reduce poverty.  57 min. <b> DVD 9790 [preservation copy]; vhs Video/C 3926
</b><br>


<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> Vol 2:  <b>Given a Chance.</b> Early 1965 is a critical period for President Johnson's war on poverty.  The Office of Economic Opportunity's goal to have the poor themselves design and run  anti-poverty programs attracts strong opposition from local and state governments.  Head Start is created to provide poor children with adequate nutrition, health care and the educational advantages that other American children enjoy.  This program focuses on the Head Start program in Mississippi.  57 min. <b> DVD 9791 [preservation copy]; vhs Video/C 3927</b><br>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> Vol 3:  <b>City of Promise.</b> The context for the war on poverty shifts after 1965. Urban rebellions provoke a sense of urgency for some, while others now see the war against poverty as hopeless.  Increasingly, the media and the public equate poverty with inner-city black communities. This program looks at the anger and despair of the poor and the powerless, and the anger and frustration of the middle class at having to pay for "others' mistakes."  It also examines attempts made in Newark, New Jersey, to reclaim the inner city through public/private partnerships.   57 min. <b>DVD 9792 [preservation copy]; vhs Video/C 3928</b><br>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> Vol 4: <b> In Service to America.  </b> By 1967, poverty warriors increase the sophistication of their tactics at the same time that a number of outspoken opponents rise to national prominence.  This program highlights the beginning of Legal Services and VISTA, two programs that combined individual action with the idea of volunteerism.  Lawyers team up with migrant farm workers in California to fight for better education, health care and working conditions, and VISTA volunteers and local residents organize against strip mining in Appalachia.  Both stories raise  significant questions about activities the government funds in the name of fighting poverty.  57 min. <b>DVD 9793 [preservation copy]; vhs Video/C 3929</b><br>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> Vol 5:   <b> My Brother's Keeper.</b> The Nixon Administration and the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO) bring the nation to the brink of overhauling the federal social security system and replacing welfare with a guaranteed income for all citizens.  When it appears the guaranteed income will be quite low, the NWRO joins an alliance of conservatives and liberals to defeat the proposed legislation.    57 min. <b>DVD 9794 [preservation copy]; vhs Video/C 3930</b>

<br><dt><b>Balance of Power.</b>(Way We Live: Introduction to Sociology; 15)<DD>Too often government only hears from insiders with access to money and education, which is why grass roots movements in the form of local and statewide initiatives often represent the best way for the average person to make his or her voice heard.

<br><dt><b>The Billionaires' Tea Party </b><dd>From the tea parties to healthcare and climate change, America's conservative citizens revolted against President Obama's reform agenda. But just how real were the roots of this supposedly grassroots uprising? Was it, in fact, an example of 'astroturfing', which is the practice of manufacturing citizens groups for the purpose of delivering corporate messages? Curious to find out, Australian filmmaker Taki Oldham went undercover to investigate. What he found was astroturfing on a scale greater than he could have imagined.

<br><dt><b><font color="#00CC99"> [Bush, George W.] </font>George W. Bush</b><dd> Presents the first in-depth assessment of the forty-first president of the United States, drawing upon new scholarship and unparalleled access to figures in Bush's private and public life. Prior to winning the presidency, George Bush served as a U.S. congressman, ambassador to the United Nations, chairman of the Republican National Committee, chief of the U.S. Liaison Office to China, director of the C.I.A, and vice president under Ronald Reagan. Despite soaring approval ratings following military victory in the Persian Gulf, his years as president after the war were marked by unrelieved decline. As the economy faltered and a recession set in, the supply-side economic policies of the 1980s were questioned and Bush was forced to break his promise of "no new taxes." Further damaging his chances for reelection was the impression that he was more concerned with world affairs than the problems vexing Main Street, USA.

<br><dt><b>Constructing Public Opinion: How Politicians and the Media Misrepresent the Public</b><dd>The media regularly use public opinion polls in their reporting of important news stories. But how exactly do they report them and to what end? In this interview, Professor Justin Lewis demonstrates the way in which polling data are themselves used by media to not just reflect what Americans think but instead to construct public opinion itself. Addressing issues such as the role the media play in "manufacturing consent" for political elites, what polls really tell us about public opinion, and what Americans actually think about politics, the program provides a new way to think about the relationship between politics, mediaand the public.

<dt><b>With God on Our Side: The Rise of the Religious Right in America</b>
<dd>Six parts, 56 minutes each. 1996.

<br>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>Part 1: The Early Crusades, 1950-1968.</b> Postwar fundamentalism is marked by optimism, mass revival meetings and disdain for worldly politics. But current events prod evangelical Christians into the political arena.  Dismayed by Supreme Court rulings banning school prayer and encouraged by the Goldwater '64 campaign, conservative Christians rise up to launch a nationwide revolt against sex education. Narrator: Cliff Robertson. Commentary: Jon Braun, Mel White, Jerry Falwell, Mark Hatfield,, Billy James Hargis, Phyllis Schlafly, James Dunn, Peter Gillquist, E.V. Hill, Haywood Robinson, Carl F. Henry, Pierre Guillermin, Charles Colson, Tim  LaHaye, Morton Blackwell, Harold I. Lief. 56 min. <b>VHS Video/C 6030</b><br>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>Part 2: The Zeal of Thy House, 1969-1974.</b> While campus evangelists go head-to-head with campus radicals Billy Graham and Richard Nixon join forces to champion "The Silent Majority." Watergate soon teaches Graham the perils of political entanglement. But the die has been cast, and in Kanawha County, West Virginia--where a local textbook controversy escalates into jailings, bombings and a miners' strike--the Religious Right is born. Narrator: Cliff Robertson.  Commentary: Mark Hatfield, Charles Colson, James Dunn, Jon Braun, Peter Gillquist, Kathryn Long, Bill Bright, Jerry Falwell, Kenneth Briggs, Pat Robertson, Paul Weyrich, James Moffett. 56 min. <b>VHS Video/C 6031</b><br>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>Part 3: We Are Family, 1974-1980.</b> When Presidential candidate Jimmy Carter declares himself "born again", the media is befuddled--but his religious faith helps convince voters he can heal the nation. 1976 heralds a new era for evangelicals in every arena, yet modern life also means divorce, feminism, and gay rights. At the White House Conference on Families, conservative Christians choose polarization on those issues over reuniting the  American family. Narrator: Cliff Robertson. Commentary: James Dunn, Bob Maddox, Kenneth Briggs, Cal Thomas, Jody Powell, Stuart Eizenstat, Pat Robertson, Connie Marshner, Os Guinness, Mel White, Phyllis Schlafly, John Carr, Paul Weyrich, Tim LaHaye, Francis Schaeffer. 56 min. <b>VHS Video/C 6032</b><br>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>Part 4: Prophets and Advisors, 1979-1984.</b> Seizing the pro-family agenda, New Right conservative strategists midwife a brood of new Christian political organizations, most notably Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority. These groups experience a heady overnight success, registering millions of evangelical voters and helping sweep Ronald Reagan into office. Yet once in the White House, his mainline Republican advisors actively suppress the traditional values issues. Evangelical leaders are forced to choose  between 'speaking the truth' and 'going along to get along' in the political realm.  Narrator: Cliff Robertson.  Commentary: Jerry Falwell, Morton Blackwell, Paul Weyrich, Connie Marshner, Francis Schaeffer, Os Guinness, Udo Middelmann, Edith Schaeffer, C. Everett Koop, Ed Dobson, James Robison, Michael Deaver, John Conlan, Pat Robertson, Cal Thomas, Ed McAteer, Mel White. 56 min.<b> VHS Video/C 6033</b><br>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>Part 5: And Who Shall Lead Them? 1985-1988.</b> Anti-abortion activists cheered when Reagan named one of their own, C. Everett Koop, as Surgeon General.  By the mid-80s, though, AIDS hits home even in fundamentalists circles and Koop splits with his former allies over the proper Christian response to this 'sign of God's judgement.'  Pat Robertson mobilizes an 'invisible army' to support his bid for the presidency.  Though dogged by televangelist scandals, the Robertson campaign sets the agenda for George Bush's victory over Michael Dukakis. Narrator: Cliff Robertson. Commentary: Everett Koop, Richard Viguerie, Paul Weyrich, Mel White, Pat Robertson, Francis Schaeffer, Jimmy Allen, Jerry Falwell, E.V. Hill, Ed Dobson, Phyllis Schlafly, Doug Wead, E.J. Dionne. 56 min. <b>VHS Video/C 6034</b><br>

<dd><IMG SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/diamond.gif" width="10" height="10"> <b>Part 6: God's Armies, 1989-1994.</b> While George Bush strains to win their trust, religious leaders turn to a new crusade: building a true grassroots power structure from the ashes of the Robertson campaign.  The fruit of their efforts, the Christian Coalition, is now one of most politically adept membership organizations ever.  Yet many inside the movement question if, in gaining power in the secular world, conservative Christians have lost their evangelical soul.  This final program lays bare the struggle for the future of the religious right and of America. Narrator: Cliff Robertson. Commentary: Pat Robertson, Ralph Reed, Doug Wead, Randall Terry, Phyllis Schlafly, E.J. Dionne, Michael Horton, Kevin Phillips, Os Guinness, Martin Mawyer, David Noebel, Bill McCartney, Luis Palau, Haywood Robinson, James Dobson, Wellington Boon, Charles Colson. 56 min. <b>VHS Video/C 6035</b>

<br><dt><b>[Ford, Gerald] Gerald Ford's America </b><dd>Scrutinizes the "first one hundred days" of the Ford presidency. In Part 1 WIN (the title refers to the slogan "Whip Inflation Now"), the TVTV crew follows Ford on a goodwill tour of his old constituency in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Having promised to end the "national nightmare" of Vietnam and Watergate, Ford took office only to face inflation and a looming recession. Ironically contrasting political rhetoric with the reality of working and middle-class America, TVTV juxtaposes a main point of Ford's platform -- that Americans should curb their spending habits -- with a GOP fundraiser in which wealthy patrons bid extravagantly for a football once held by Ford.

<br><dt><b>The Evolution of Revolution: Live from Tehran.</b> <i>(Century: Events that Shaped the World; 11.)</i><dd>During the Carter administration, Iranian students seized the American embassy in Tehran--and 53 American hostages--to begin a standoff that lasted until Ronald Reagan's inauguration 444 days later. What factors prompted that act of terrorism? This program examines the history of America's relations with Iran and the consequences of an American foreign policy shaped more by a desire to protect an oil-dependent standard of living and opposition to communist expansion than to promote democracy. 73 min.  <b>Video/C 6352</b><br>

<br><dt><b> Fahrenheit 9/11</b><dd>Through actual footage, interviews, and declassified documents, Michael Moore illustrates the connections President Bush has to the royal house of Saud of Saudia Arabia and the bin Laden's, how the president got elected on fraudulent circumstances and then proceeded to blunder through his duties while ignoring warnings of the looming betrayal by his foreign partners. When the treachery hits with the 9/11 attacks, Moore explains how Bush failed to take immediate action to defend the nation.

<dt><b>Michael Moore Hates America</b><dd>A controversial documentary that examines the filmmaking methods of director Michael Moore. Michael Wilson humorously satirizes Moore's own dogged pursuit of GM President Roger Smith in Moore's 1989 documentary "Roger & Me." As he travels from Coast to Coast, Wilson encounters celebrities, writers, politicians and everyday citizens in a candid and often surprising account of the cultural dialogue in modern America.

<br><dt><b>Poisoned Dreams (1960-1964).</b> <i>(The Century: America's Time; 10.)</i><dd>Beset by both international and domestic pressures, America during the Camelot years was swiftly approaching a political-cultural meltdown. This program documents U.S.-Soviet conflicts of interest in Cuba and Vietnam and the growing polarization at home between civil rights activists and segregationist hard-liners, which resulted in the Birmingham riots and the freedom march on Washington, D.C. 43 min. <b>Video/C 6363</b><br>

<dt><b> Religion's Role in World Affairs.</b><dd> Should religion have a place in American foreign policy? The U.S. was founded on the separation of Church and state but elsewhere religious beliefs explicitly inform and animate government policies.

At the same time religion can play a role in conflict resolution and peaceful change. Douglas Johnston of the Center for Strategic and Internatinal Studies and John Esposito of Georgetown University discuss if America is equipped to help channel religious forces in peaceful directions as a foreign policy strategy.

<br><dt><b>Why We Fight. </b><dd>Written and directed by Eugene Jarecki.  Explores a half-century of U.S. foreign policy from World War II to the Iraq War, revealing how, as Dwight Eisenhower had warned in his 1961 Farewell Address, political and corporate interests have become alarmingly entangled in the business of war. On a deeper level, what emerges is a portrait of a nation in transition--drifting dangerously far from her founding principles toward a more imperial and uncertain future.  Special features: Extra scenes; extended character featurettes; filmmaker TV appearances : The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, Charlie Rose; audience Q&A with filmmaker; filmmaker audio commentary with Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson; theatrical trailer. 99 min. 2005.<B> DVD 5766
