Cast: Sacha Baron Cohen, Ken Davitian, Luenell, Pamela Anderson.  Fictional Kazakhstani TV personality Borat is dispatched to the United States to report on the "greatest country in the world."

<dt><b>Dark Side of the Moon</b><dd>The progress of film and television technology has made it possible to manipulate images without it being obvious. This documentary begins with the revelation that director Stanley Kubrick contributed to the success of the US space program with his film "2001: A space odyssey." With the support of NASA, Kubrick invented an astonishing scenario for the images of the moon landing, validating it with "hijacked" archival footage, false documents, and authenic interviews out of context. As the documentary progresses it forces the viewer to realize how difficult it is to separate truth from manipulation in the media. Director, William Karel. 2002. 52 min. <B>DVD 8684; vhs Video/C  MM393</B><br>

A raging crowd of protesters are waiting for President George W. Bush's procession. As the President gives a patriotic speech inside a hotel, the demonstrators' fury increases to the breaking point. The tension mounts until the horrible instant where the President is assassinated. Following the assassination, the FBI hunts for the assassin. All the suspects are interviewed and released except one, the Syrian man who is convicted and put on death row. There is circumstantial evidence against him, but is he really guilty of the crime? Or does his being Middle Eastern provide a convenient excuse to label the death of the President as an Act of Terror?  90 min. <B>DVD 7432</B><dd><img SRC="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/star.gif" border=0>

<dt><b>EPIC 2014.</b>(1967)<dd>A film  by Matt Thompsonand Robin Sloan. "The year is 2014. the press as we know it no longer exists. Traditional reporting has collapsed. News is churned out by the media giant Googlezon. (Google has taken over many companies and joined forces with Amazon.) The news consists of blogs, attitudes, discoveries, preferences, claims, and random thoughts, gathered and shaped by computers and a few human editors, then fed back to ordinary people who produce the continuing conversation. The New York Times is off the Internet. It still publishes, but the newspaper has become a newsletter read only by the elite and the elderly.
This is the finding of a clever, eight-minute mock documentary, EPIC 2014, produced by the fictional Museum of Media History (in reality, journalists Matt Thompson of the Fresno Bee and Robin Sloan of Current, a new cable news channel in San Francisco). Thompson and Sloan recently added a short section taking the history up to 2015. The mockumentary is starting to reach a mass audience at a time of unusually high anxiety for the news industry. The news business has been hobbled by a string of scandals and credibility problems. Skirmishes between reporters and bloggers seem like the beginning of a long war between old media and new. Newspaper publishers are nervous--some would say paralyzed with fright--over polls showing that young adults are not reading papers. Their audience is dying off. A lot of young people say they get their news from a brief look at headline news or from late-night comedians. [Leo, John.

<br><DT><B>F is for Fake </b>(1973)<dd>Directed and written by Orson Welles. This film-essay, done in a pseudo-documentary style is a meditation on illusionism, the role of the artist being that of a charlatan-magician. Portraits of art forger Elmyr de Hory (using footage from Francois Reichenbach's film) and Clifford Irving (forger of Howard Hughes' autobiography) intermingle with Welle's own connection with "fakes" -- Picasso paintings and his famous War of the Worlds radio broadcast. Above all, Welles delights in the artifice of the cinema -- the power of editing to "fake," cinematic space. DVD special features: Disc 1. The film: audio commentary by Ojar Kodar and Gary Graver; introduction by Peter Bogdanovich; extended 9-min. trailer -- Disc 2. "Orson Welles: one-man band" (1995), an 88-minute documentary about Welles's unfinished projects; "Almost true: the noble art of forgery" (1997), a 52-minute documentary about art forger Elmyr de Hory; a "60 minutes" interview with Clifford Irving, from 2000, about his Howard Hughes autobiography hoax; a 1972 Hughes press conference exposing Irving's hoax; a new essay by film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum.  <B>DVD 3777; also VHS Video/C MM310</B>

<br><dt><b>The Festival: Disaster Film Has a Whole New Meaning.</b> (TV, 2005) <dd>A hilarious and all-too-realistic spoof of the film industry, The Festival is a 6-part mockumentary series starring wide-eyed young filmmaker Rufus Marquez. As seen through the lens of fictional documentarian Cookie Armstrong, Marquez hitchhikes his way to the impossibly pretentious Mountain United Film Festival (M.U.F.F.), clutching the only copy of his first feature, "The unreasonable truth of butterflies." Recently divorced and living in his mother's basement, Marquez desperately wants his big break; instead he's pushed to the edge of a breakdown. At M.U.F.F., absurdity piles onto absurdity as the charmingly naive Marquez enters a zany world of bitter veteran filmmakers, self-important Hollywood executives, preening actor-gods, and obnoxious groupies.

A fictitious scientist called Dr. Nils Hellstrom (played by Lawrence Pressman) guides viewers throughout the film.

The film combines short clips from horror and science fiction movies with extraordinary camera sequences of butterflies, locusts, wasps, termites, ants, mayflies, other insects rarely seen before on film and insectivorous plants/insects. 90  min.

<br><DT><b>Land Without Bread (Las Hurdes)  </b>(1937)<dd>Directed by Luis Bu&ntilde;uel.  "...Focuses on the Las Hurdes region of Spain, the mountainous area around the town La Alberca, and the intense poverty of its occupants. Bu&ntilde;uel, who made the film after reading the ethnographic study Las Jurdes: &eacute;tude de g&eacute;ographie humaine (1927) by Maurice Legendre, took a Surrealist approach to the notion of the anthropological expedition. The result was a travelogue in which the narrator's extreme (indeed, exaggerated) descriptions of human misery of Las Hurdes contrasts with his flat and disinterested manner.

Although some film scholars describe it as a documentary, Land Without Bread is actually an early (some might say prescient) parody of the barely invented genre of documentary filmmaking, according to anthropologist Jeffrey Ruoff."

<br><dt><b> Mao: The Real Man.   </b><dd> Using old newsreel footage, photos, documents and well known historical facts, this "documentary" film plays a game with history and the viewer in an experiment proving that even the greatest nonsense can be made believable when supported by such "evidence"...it all depends on context and presentation.   "Nothing is true in the film...you were part of an experiment"--Closing credits.
<br>
"The century's greatest political mysteries explained!  The strange history of Maos' Chicago gangster brother and evil doppelganger revealed!  And what about those recent sitings of Elvis and the beatific 103 year old Mao in a Dubuque K-Mart? Film maker Szilveszter Siklosi's hilariously demented brand of historical revisionism interweaves "real" history, carefully edited archival footage, fake "expert witnesses,"and straightfaced academic blather to demonstrate that in an age of electronic reproduction, anything is possible and everything is dangerously close to believable."

<br><dt><b>--No Lies</b><DD> Directed by Mitchell W. Block. 1972. The film unfolds as a conversation between a male interviewer and a young woman who has recently been raped. The interviewer's probing questions strip away the woman's defenses, offering an intimate view of the trauma suffered by a rape victim as she confronts the police, her doctor, her friends, and her conscience.<br> "...No Lies is more than just a critique of the verite style. When the credits appear at the end of the film and provide the only clue that the film is a "fake" 'not a "real"' documentary, the first-time viewer may be more than a little puzzled. Eitzen writes that the film adheres so rigorously to documentary form that first-time viewers who were unaware of the film's true nature often become "visibly disturbed" at how the character of the filmmaker treats the woman. Upon being told that it is a fiction film, these same people redirect much of their anger to Mitchell Block, the man who made the film. "Viewers now feel angry at having been duped," he writes. Eitzen attributes this anger to the fact that the film lies about its true nature. It pretends to be a documentary, but is not. He states that No Lies is "a fiction film about rape, but it is a documentary about documentaries. But No Lies is unusual among mock documentaries, as it has the power to enrage its viewers by its central deception. Also, its principal goal is to dupe the audience, something not found in such extreme measures in later mock documentaries (though Man Bites Dog (1991) and Forgotten Silver (1996) come close)."

<br><DT><B>Symbiopsychotaxiplasm: Take One</b><DD>Cast:  Patricia Ree Gilbert, Don Fellows, Jonathan Gordon, Bob Rosen, William Greaves.
Director William Greaves presides over a beleaguered film crew in New York's Central Park, leaving them to try to figure out what kind of movie they're making. A couple enacts a breakup scenario over and over as a documentary crew films the crew filming the action. Locals wander casually into the frame: the project defies easy description. Yet this wildly innovative sixties counterculture landmark remains one of the most tightly focused and insightful movies ever made about making movies.   Special features: "Discovering William Greaves": a new documentary on Greave's career, featuring Greaves, his wife and coproducer Louise Archambault, actress Ruby Dee, filmmaker St. Clair Bourne, and film scholar Scott MacDonald; theatrical trailer.  1968. 75 min.

<br><DT><B>Stereo</B> (Canada, 1969)<DD>Directed by David Cronenberg. Cast: Jack Messinger, Iain Ewing, Clara Mayer, Paul Mulholland, Ronald Mlodzik. In this first film by Cronenberg, he borrows the structure of an educational film, masquerading as a documentary record of an experiment performed by The Canadian Academy for Erotic Inquiry. The plot centers around a series of surgical techniques that are designed to create the ability for telepathic communication. Initially successful, the researchers introduce the telepaths to various drugs, including aphrodisiacs, to increase the intensity of the bond and induce a state of "omnisexuality." When the telepaths begin to isolate themselves, however, it becomes clear that the experiment has had unforseen side effects -- that ultimately lead to violence. 63 min. <B>DVD 4963</B>

<br><dt><b>Africa Addio </b>(1966)<dd>Directed by Gualtiero Jacopetti and Franco Prosperi. "This film says farewell to the old Africa and gives the world a picture of its agony," graphically depicting the violent battles for control in Africa as the European colonial governments left the continent in the 1960s. Includes footage of genocide in Zanzibar, Watusi and Mau Mau massacres, mercenary assaults in the Congo, industrial complicity in South African apartheid, civil unrest, famine, and the slaughter of endangered animals. Despite thunderous acclaim, worldwide controversy drove this film from American theaters shortly after its premiere. An edited version with 45 minutes removed was re-released as "Africa, blood and guts." This is the original restored 128 min. English language version.   <B>DVD 5106</B>

<br><dt><b>Africa Speaks! </b><dd>Narrator, Lowell Thomas. Documentary account of Paul Hoefler's photography expedition through central Africa in 1928-1929. Containing many varied and interesting shots of African tribes and wildlife, the film footage from it was later interpolated into many jungle-themed adventure movies. Originally released as a motion picture in 1930. 60 min.<B>DVD X6639;  Video/C MM536
</B>



<br><dt><b><A NAME="africana">Africana </A>(aka Mondo Africana)</b>(1957; 1984)<dd>Long before the Italian Mondo Canes established the shockumentary genre, this American film set the groundwork. Although supposedly a "serious" documentary the filmakers went out of their way to film the weird and the wicked -- safari hunts, manhood initiation ceremonies, hot coal walkers, frenzied religious ceremonies where the participants pierce their bodies and so on. The film so perfectly foreshadowed the 1960's Mondo craze that the distributor later retitled and re-released it as "Mondo Africana." Originally released in 1957; edited and expanded version released in 1984.  Produced and written by Cedric Worth. 80 min. <B>Video/C MM1034</B>


<br><dt><b>Atrocities of the Orient</b>(1948) <dd>A Philippine produced "shockumentary" recreating the widespread rapes and murders of Filipino women by Japanese soldiers during the WWII Japanese occupation, just before the American invasion. Also chronicles efforts by Filipino citizens to combat the invaders.   80 min. <B>Video/C MM538</B>



<br><dt><b>Baboona (Mr. and Mrs. Martin Johnson's Baboona: An Aerial Epic Over Africa  </b><dd>
Early 20th century naturalists and explorers, Martin and Osa Johnson journey across Africa in 1935 in two amphibious airplanes, encountering and filming African natives and many forms of wildlife including lions, rhino, elephants, and especially a large population of baboons.  A prime example of the type of popular, wildly exploitative travel film made in the US between 1920 and 1950.  73 min. <B>Video/C MM304</B>

<br><dt><b>Blonde Captive.</b><dd>Directed by Clinton Childs, Ralph P. King, Linus J. Wilson, Paul Withington (as Dr. Paul Withington).  On expedition in the remote reaches of Australia, Harvard professor Paul Withington sought a living descendant of the Neanderthal man of 50,000 years ago when he made his astounding discovery: a blonde English-speaking woman was found naked living in a cave. "All true, all filmed as it happened."  Narrated by Lowell Thomas. 1931.  74 min. <B>DVD X6003</B>




<br><dt><b>Borneo.</b><dd>Narrated by Lowell Thomas ; comic commentary by Lew Lehr and Russell Shields.

Produced by and featuring Martin and Osa Johnson; directed by Truman Talley. 1937.  76 min.  <B>Video/C MM305</B>





<br><dt><b>Bo-ru, the Ape Boy.</b>(1930)<dd>This documentary gives an example of a boy who was raised by apes, found by an African tribe and assimilated into their village.

<br><dt><b>Brutes and Savages.</b>(1977)<dd>Produced and directed by Arthur Davis. Fascinated by forbidden rituals and ceremonies, world explorer Arthur Davis takes a crew with hidden cameras to Africa and South America to secretly record the beauty and horror of the "law of the jungle." Shocking, brutal and repulsive, this film mixes bizarre authentic footage with incredible (and often hilarious) "re-enactments" of his findings. Animal sacrifices, bizarre tribal ceremonies, mating rituals....and more. When first released in 1977, the film was cut to avoid problems with censors. This is the restored full length version.  107 min. <B>DVD 5113</B>


<br><dt><b>Cannibal Holocaust</b>(1980) <dd>Directed by Ruggero Deodato.  Banned and heavily censored the world over, here is a film that is so intense, graphic and unflinching in its realistic portrayal of cannibalism that the director and producer were arrested upon its original release.

Eventually he meets the tribe responsible for the crew's demise and returns to the U.S. with several rolls of "found footage." Disc 1. Cannibal holocaust -- Disc 2.

<br><dt><b>Cannibal Island</b>(1956) <dd>The uncredited footage in Cannibal Island which appears to be of 1930's vintage takes the viewer to the savage South Sea islands where girls are girls, and men eat men. Shown are lovely topless Samoan girls and Melanesian pygmy cannibals. The stolid, stilted narrator, while condescending and racist, illuminates both the "primitive" ways of the documentary's subjects and the social naivete of the film-makers.  55 min.  <B>Video/C 4902</B>

<br><dt><b>Champagne Safari</b> <dd>This archival rarity presents the extravagant safari through Africa taken by actress Rita Hayworth and her husband Aly Kahn, in the early 1950's. Traveling by private plane, jeep, limousine and rickshaw, the celebrated couple stops in Tanganyika, Uganda, Kenya and the Belgian Congo among other locales. The film, a fascinating record of neo-colonialism and gaudy excess, offers a rare glimpse into two worlds: old time Hollywood and colonial Africa. 1952. 60 min. Video/C 9472<br>

A prime example of the type of popular, wildly exploitative travel film made in the US between 1920 and 1950. 1932. 67 min. <B>Video/C MM306</B>

<br><dt><b>The Godfathers of Mondo</b><dd>Discusses the films of Gualtiero Jacopetti and Franco Prosperi, from their lives as journalists and careers as filmmakers, through success and scandal, from the "tragic misunderstanding" that made them international criminals to the reasons behind their bitter break-up. Forty years later, Jacopetti and Prosperi, still passionate and proud, expose the bizarre truths behind the Mondo productions, explore the frenzy surrounding the Mondo rumors and the incredible legacy of the Mondo phenomenon. Includes interviews with the two filmmakers and others who worked with them, behind-the-scenes footage, home movies, and scenes from their films.
