</dl>


<br>"A social problem film is a narrative film that integrates a larger social conflict into the individual conflict between its characters. Like many film genres, the exact definition is often in the eye of the beholder, but Hollywood did produce and market a number of topical films in the 1930s and by the 1940s, the boxoffice heyday, the term "social problem" or "message" film was conventional in its usage among the film industry and the public." [<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_problem_film#The_1930s">Wikipedia</A>]
<br>
"[The social problem film] combines social analysis and dramatic conflict  within a coherent narrative structure.  Social content is transformed into dramatic events and movie narrative adapted to accommodate social issues as story material through a particular set of movie conventions.  These conventions distinguish the social problem film as a genre.
...The important distinugishing feature of the genre is its didacticism.  It deals with social themes very much on the surface of the dramatic action." [<B>The Hollywood social problem film : from the Depression to the fifties</B> / Peter Roffman & Jim Purdy
Bloomington : Indiana University Press, c1981)

<br><dt><b>Traffic in Souls</b>    (1913)<dd>Directed by George Loane Tucker. Cast: Jane Gail, Matt Moore, Ethel Grandin, Fred Turner.
Produced when social problem dramas were popular and co-financed by reform groups, this film is set against the white slavery rackets of the 1910s. Purportedly based on findings of "the John D. Rockefeller White Slavery Report and the investigation of the Vice Trust by District Attorney Whitman," the melodrama is skillfully crafted to evoke the feel of "true crime" in the Victorian era, like the pages of the National Police Gazette brought vividly to life. The film was reportedly screened before female immigrants at Ellis Island as a caution to the dangers of the New World.

Meanwhile, the family waits. He arrives home late and abusive.

"Frank Taylor is an average hard-working Joe in a machine shop with ambitions to become foreman. When the job opens, it is given to Joe Dombrowski, a Polish-American immigrant who spends his free time reading technical books on the workings of a drill press rather than socializing with other workers. Frank becomes disgruntled and is easily recruited by a co-worker to join the Black Legion, a secretive hate group similar to the Ku Klux Klan, which appeals to the xenophobic fears of its members and uses violence to intimidate foreign-born Americans. When Frank and other black-hooded Legionaires burn out Dombrowski's chicken farm, the frightened family leaves town, opening up the foreman's job again. When Legion business begins to occupy more and more of Frank's time and energy both in the factory and at night, it soon costs him his job and ultimately his marriage as it leads him toward tragedy."

<dt><b>Crossfire.   </b> (1947)<dd>Directed by Edward Dmytryk. Cast: Robert Young, Robert Mitchum, Robert Ryan, Gloria Grahame, Paul Kelly, Sam Levene, Jacqueline White, Steve Brodie, George Cooper, Richard Benedict, Richard Powers, William Phipps, Lex Barker, Marlo Dwyer.  This intense thriller was shot entirely with a style reminiscent of expressionism.  A Jew is murdered in a New York hotel, and three ex-soldiers are suspected.  Hollywood's first strong statement against anti-semitism.  (Interestingly, the original script of <i>Crossfire</i> concerned the murder of a homosexual; 1940's Hollywood apparently found it more palatable to deal with anti-semitism than homophobia). Based on Richard Brook's novel, <I>The Brick Foxhole</I>.  Special DVD features: Exclusive behind-the-scenes retrospective on the making of Crossfire and interview with director Edward Dmytryk.  86 min.  <b>DVD 4115; vhs 999:1027</b>

<dt><b>Bad Day at Black Rock</b> (1954) <dd>Directed by John Sturges. Cast:  Spencer Tracy, Robert Ryan, Anne Francis, Dean Jagger, Walter Brennan, John Ericson, Ernest Borgnine, Lee Marvin, Russell Collins, Walter Sande.
"Bad Day at Black Rock is both a tightly-written, suspenseful, dramatic action film (with film noirish qualities) and a western. On the surface, this American film classic is concerned with the themes of individual integrity, group conformity and complacency, and civic responsibility. It can also be seen as a powerful, allegorical indictment of the Hollywood blacklist, created during the climate of suspicion and fear of the 1950s McCarthy era.  The message of director John Sturges' taut and influential film can be interpreted with different levels of meaning, but predominantly as the tense portrayal of a one-armed stranger who intrusively has arrived in a half-forgotten desert town filled with ruffians. Over a twenty-four hour period, he finds himself unwelcome and facing several ominous characters, animosity, collective guilt, hypocrisy, and bigotry. The film builds suspense by withholding information about the visitor's mysterious mission, and by creating a who-dun-it mystery regarding the hostile town's secret. Eventually, he learns the town's dark secret, and fulfills the promise he made to present a posthumous Congressional Medal of Honor for heroism to the farming father of a Japanese wartime buddy who had saved his life in World War II on the battlefields of Italy."

<br><dt><b>The  Garment Jungle</b> (1957)<dd>Directed by Vincent Sherman.  Cast: Lee J. Cobb, Kerwin Mathews, Gia Scala, Richard Boone, Valerie French, Robert Loggia.
"Vincent Sherman replaced an uncredited Robert Aldrich as director of this noirish and atypically pro-union film from the 1950's. Tulio Renata (Robert Loggia), an organizer for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, campaigns to unionize the employees of dress factory owner Walter Mitchell (Lee J. Cobb). Viscerally opposed to the union, Mitchell has hired Artie Ravidge (Richard Boone) to thwart Renata's efforts. In a complex oedipal sub-plot, Walter's son Alan (Kerwin Matthews) returns home and joins the firm following the suspicious death of his father's partner. Alan is more sympathetic to the union and attempts to persuade his father to sign a contract. Only after Ravidge kills Renata, and the elder Mitchell finally admits to himself that Ravidge is a thug who also killed his partner, does he agree to negotiate with the union. Before he can do so, however, he, too, is murdered by Ravidge's goons. It is then left to Alan, increasingly involved with Renata's widow Theresa (Gia Scala), to run the business, bring Ravidge to justice, and settle with the union. Similar to Herbert Biberman's Salt of the Earth (1954) in its overt support of the labor movement, The Garment Jungle is clearly a liberal, not a radical, film. Rather than advocate class warfare, it asserts that honest unions and decent capitalists can work together honorably. The film's real fire is found in the personal conflicts between Tulio and Theresa and Walter and Alan. Cobb, Loggia, and Scala perform with intense and multi-dimensional passion. Particularly noteworthy is Theresa's fury at her husband for taking excessive, and ultimately fatal, risks."

<br><dt><b>On the Waterfront </b>(1954) <dd>Directed by  Elia Kazan.   Cast:  Marlon Brando, Karl Malden, Lee J. Cobb, Rod Steiger, Pat Henning, Eva Marie Saint.  Mob-connected union boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb) rules the waterfront with an iron fist. The police know that he's been responsible for a number of murders, but witnesses play deaf and dumb ("plead D & D"). Washed-up boxer Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) has had an errand-boy job because of the influence of his brother Charley, a crooked union lawyer (Rod Steiger). Witnessing one of Friendly's rub-outs, Terry is willing to keep his mouth shut until he meets the dead dockworker's sister Edie (Eva Marie Saint). "Waterfront priest" Father Barry (Karl Malden) tells Terry that Edie's brother was killed because he was going to testify against boss Friendly before the crime commission. Because he could have intervened, but didn't, Terry feels somewhat responsible for the death. When Father Barry receives a beating from Friendly's goons, Terry is persuaded to cooperate with the commission.
