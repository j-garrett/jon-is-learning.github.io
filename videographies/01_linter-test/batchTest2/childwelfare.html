<br><dt><b>Bangkok Girl</b><dd>This tragic documentary provides a glimpse into Thailand's notorious and booming sex tourism industry through the experiences of a 19-year-old bar girl named Pla. Working in the bars from the age of thirteen, Pla has managed to avoid selling her body--a remarkable revelation given her surroundings--but her refusal to take part in this all-too-common profession for young Thai women cannot last.

<br><dt><b>Beyond Good & Evil: Children, Media and Violent Times.</b><dd>Intro: Where were you? -- A simple story -- Playing at war -- Constructing the enemy.  "Full of poignant footage and moving responses from children, exposes how the media has been used to earn public support for the U.S.-led military campaign against Iraq. The news coverage, as well as movies, television shows and video games that have incorporated the narrative of war into their storylines, has an especially profound influence on children, who often bring both entertainment and real-world violence to their play. This video examines how the "good and evil" rhetoric, in both the entertainment and the news media, has helped children to dehumanize the enemies, justify their killing and treat the suffering of innocent civilians as necessary sacrifice." c2003. 37 min.
