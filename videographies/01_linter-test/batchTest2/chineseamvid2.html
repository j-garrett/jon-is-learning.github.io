<br><dt><b>More to the Chinese Side. </b><dd>
"I used to think that we were the typical Asian American family," muses William Gow, a fifth-generation Chinese American of biracial descent, as several family members describe instances of how they are commonly mistaken for other ethnicities. Intrigued by thesemisperceptions, Gow invites his parents and other relatives to share their experiences and views on how they see themselves in relation to the larger Asian American community. His Caucasian mother and Chinese father provide insights into raising biracial children; his Chinese cousin observes how being adopted repeatedly throws off people's expectations of him. Interspersed with historical details about Chinese immigration to the U.S., the interviews warmly touch upon the complexities of a family negotiating ethnic identities within an Asian American community that is constantly changing. 2003. 17 min.
