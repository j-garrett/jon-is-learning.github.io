By showing how these modern day masters approach life from within their chosen fields, Ruspoli's film celebrates the ability of human beings to find meaning in the world through the mastery of physical, intellectual, and creative skills.

Going beyond the Lacanian Real, this film examines those real elements (which may or may not resist symbolization) that constitute the nodal points of our worldly existence -- the points that undermine all systematic attempts to determine this existence in advance and by means of externally derived iron laws. It is unlikely that Zizek himself would put the matter in this fashion, because his strategy is precisely to flirt with iron principles (what he has most recently named "lost causes") in order to expose how the political contingencies of our world are veiled by a palliative language that uses the alibi of contingency to defeat principles.
