"Secrets of the Tribe","The field of anthropology goes under the magnifying glass in this fiery investigation of the seminal research on Yanomami Indians. In the 1960s and '70s, a steady stream of anthropologists filed into the Amazon Basin to observe this ""virgin"" society untouched by modern life. Thirty years later, the events surrounding this infiltration have become a scandalous tale of academic ethics and infighting. Director José Padilha brilliantly employs two provocative strategies to raise unsettling questions about the boundaries of cultural encounters. He allows professors accused of heinous activities to defend themselves, and the Yanomamo to represent their side of the story. As this riviting excavation deconstructs anthropology's colonial legacy, it challenges our society's myths of objectivity and the very notion of ""the other."" Director, José Padilha. c2010. 98 min.

"Moana: A Romance of the South Seas.","""Life and love in the South Seas... Robert Flaherty's famous travelogue."" The rites, customs, and daily lives of the Samoan natives of Savaii Island, Western Samoa are depicted in this early 20th century ethnographic film. ""In 1923, Jesse Lasky of Paramount offered Flaherty the opportunity to shoot a film anywhere in the world?so long as it turned out to be another Nanook. Flaherty, along with his wife and family, traveled to the village of Safune on the Samoan island of Savi?i to record the traditional culture of a civilization which was rapidly changing and becoming westernized under British rule. The result was Moana: A Romance of the Golden Age. Shot in black and white on panchromatic film, Moana has an almost stereoscopic look?the figures seem solid and real and the colors of the island foliage appear as varying shades of silvery-gray. The film explores the lives of the lovely and gentle Samoans and culminates in a ritual tattooing. Although not on the same level as Nanook or some of Flaherty?s later work, Moana was received with critical acclaim and popularity on its release. In fact, John Grierson coined the term ""documentary"" to describe the film. During the making of Moana, Flaherty, the independent filmmaker, had his first conflict with the studio system when Paramount insisted he cut the film for a slightly shorter running time.""

"Keeping it Real (Echter dan echt)","Part of the (who is s/he) project, produced in collaboration with Mama Cash. Camera, Sunny Bergman ... [et. al.] ; editor, Milika de Jong ; final editing IKON, Wessel van der Hammen ; music, Rimer Veeman. Investigates why an increasing number of people in our modern, highly developed societies, are eagerly seeking ""authentic,"" real-life experiences, while at the same time trying to fathom the meaning of the concept itself. ""Keeping it Real"" profiles a sailor and world adventurer whose exploits are marketed in books, photos and videos to fascinated, wannabe adventurers; goes behind-the-scenes of a city tour with a real-life ""homeless"" person; interviews an African immigrant whose life experience fulfills a Western fantasy of being more connected to nature; follows an office worker who takes a year off to sail alone around the world; and questions pop-music stars how they distinguish between their public personas and real lives. The idealized representations of 'authenticity' being promoted or pursued are shown to be inherently inauthentic or at least illusory. A Film by Sunny Bergman. 2004. 51 min.

"The Love Market","In the highlands of North Vietnam lies the remote town of Sapa, home to a mosaic of colorful hill tribes. Sapa opened to tourism in the late 1990's and now roughly 200 hill tribe girls aged 7-18 years live independently on the streets of Sapa selling embroidery. A few years ago Australian film maker Shalom Almond visited Sapa as a tourist and became friends with four Hmong girls. The girls are savvy, street smart and dream of life beyond selling souvenirs. But how will these young girls survive the leap from remote tribal culture to 21st century Asia? Over the next three years Shalom returns to Vietnam with her camera to find out.

"Milking the Rhino","A ferocious kill on the Serengeti; warnings about endangered species... These clich?s of nature films ignore a key landscape feature: villagers just off-camera who endure the dangers and costs of living with wild animals. The Maasai tribe of Kenya and Namibia's Himba -- two of earth's oldest cattle cultures -- are emerging from a century of 'white man's conservation,' which threw them off their lands, banned subsistence hunting and fueled resentment. They are discovering that earnings from wildlife tourism can rival the benefits of livestock. But change is not easy. Charting the collision of ancient ways with Western expectations, this film offers complex, intimate stories of Africans at the forefront of community-based conservation.
