"Constructing Public Opinion: How Politicians and the Media Misrepresent the Public","The media regularly use public opinion polls in their reporting of important news stories. But how exactly do they report them and to what end? In this interview, Professor Justin Lewis demonstrates the way in which polling data are themselves used by media to not just reflect what Americans think but instead to construct public opinion itself. Addressing issues such as the role the media play in ""manufacturing consent"" for political elites, what polls really tell us about public opinion, and what Americans actually think about politics, the program provides a new way to think about the relationship between politics, media and the public. 2001. 31 min.

"Fear and Favor in the Newsroom.","Examines the need to protect freedom of the press and investigative journalism in the United States when newspapers and television stations are owned and influenced by large corporations hostile to media exposure. Examines case studies of investigative journalists who have been dismissed or forced to resign because of ""too aggressive"" journalistic practices and cases of censorship mandated by television and print media management.
""Fear & Favor in the Newsroom demonstrates how ownership of the press by a small corporate elite constricts the free flow of ideas and information on which our democracy depends. The testimony of some of the nation's most distinguished journalists - including four Pulitzer Prize winners - shatters the myth perpetrated by the media themselves that editorial decisions are made ""without fear or favor."" Internalizing the lessons of spiked stories, demotions and firings, journalists quickly learn to censor themselves rather than aggressively pursue stories which might conflict with the interests of their corporate employers. Fear & Favor in the Newsroom provokes important questions and discussions about ownership of the 'free press.'"" 1996. 56 min.

"Images in Media","The pictures in our heads that define who we are and help us neatly categorize others are increasingly shaped by newspaper, magazine, film, and TV images.

This program is a behind-the-scenes look at the media's image-makers, from the first photographers to today's Madison Avenue wizards, and asks some disturbing questions about the self-selected few who hold a distorted mirror up to society.

"Lifeline: The History of International Radio","In March of 1927, short-wave radio broadcasts from the Netherlands were received in Indonesia. This watershed event, preceding the BBC and Moscow Radio, marked the beginning of international broadcasting. This documentary traces the 70-year history of world broadcasting and its importance to world communication. World War II leaders broadcast radio messages to Resistance forces and to the thousands living in occupied countries. Propaganda was disseminated by all sides during the Cold War. Program managers from the BBC and Radio Netherlands discuss radio's continuing role as information lifeline to less-developed nations. A film by Rob Hof. Originally produced in 1997.

Academic experts discuss the impact of early innovators like Frank Conrad of station KDKA, Pittsburgh, who broadcasted from his garage; the power of personalities to influence mass audiences, citing FDR, Edward R. Murrow, and Orson Welles as examples; radio's role as a vehicle for delivering mass audiences to advertisers; and the superior ability of the radio to entertain and actively engage listeners in the ""theater of the mind.""

As owner and operator of his nation's oldest and only free radio station, Dominique was frequently at odds with his country's various repressive governments and spent much of the 80's and early 90's in exile in New York, where Demme continued to interview him over the years. Dominique fought tirelessly against his country's overwhelming injustice, oppression, and poverty, but it was his shocking and still-unsolved assassination in April of 2000 that gave the director the impetus to assemble more than a decade's worth of material into a celebration of this dynamic man's life and legacy.

Conversely, if ""political correctness"" is intended to counteract discrimination and intolerance, should it be used as a vehicle of censorship? Does PC heighten public awareness of marginalized groups or is it censorship designed to limit intellectual inquiry in the name of particular political agendas?
