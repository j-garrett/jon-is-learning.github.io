"India: The Untouchables: The Small Secret of India","Today it is illegal in India to discriminate against Dalits, which literally means ""the oppressed,"" the term now commonly used to refer to India's former untouchables. Despite the legal abolition of untouchability a half-century ago, they continue to be the target of systematic discrimination and comprise a highly disproportionate percentage of India's illiterate, landless and jobless population. Dalits number 260 million Hindus, making caste discrimination one of the world's biggest human rights issues. The film describes several examples of caste discrimination and also discusses the landlord-sponsored militia, Ranbir Sena's Army, which is attacking agricultural laborers and their families, all of them Dalits. The Ranbir Sena says the Dalits will be targets unless they cease their agitation for better pay and land and repudiate the Naxhalites. These are Maoist armed-activists who have gained a following in parts of Bihar by assisting agricultural workers in organizing and defending themselves from landlord violence.

"Pink Saris","The ""Pink Gang"" is a group of women who wear pink saris as a symbol of their revolt against their society. They are victims of domestic violence, rape and social exclusion. Their champion is Sampat Pal Devi, who takes up their cases of social injustice, often perpetrated by their husbands' extended families, with whom they're forced to live. Declaring 'women have nothing but their tears; what else do they have?', Sampat Pal has learned from experience. Once a child-bride and a victim of abuse herself, Sampat has no fear. She fought back and escaped the family, and now beleaguered women from throughout Uttar Pradesh seek her out, looking for the support and strength to do the same. Sampat Pal laudably takes up their causes, dramatically throwing herself into the middle of family dramas, yet for all her spirited righteousness, she can be forced to compromise in the face of the entrenched conventions and traditions she is railing against. A film by Kim Longinotto with Amber Latiff and Girjashankar Vohra. 2010. 96 min.

"Shipbreakers","Welcome to Alang, India, the site of a gargantuan scrap yard where ocean-going ships come to die. Forty thousand Indians live and work here, dismembering and scavenging the hulks of 400 vessels every year. This documentary chronicles the daily lives of the people who work here, the barefoot men who take apart giant mountains of steel by hand, piece by piece, as they spend months toiling sun-up to sun-down destroying ship after ship. It is the world's most unregulated industry. Ship owners rarely bother to abide by the UN Base Convention, which bans shipments of transboundary waste. One worker a day, on average, dies on the job, from gas explosions, falls or from tons of falling steel. Still one in four will contract cancers caused by asbestos, PCBs or other toxic substances.
