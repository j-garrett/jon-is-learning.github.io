"[Williams, Arleigh Taber] Dean of Students Arleigh Williams: The Free Speech Movement and the Six Years War, 1964-1970: Oral History Transcript","Interviews conducted by Germaine LaBerge; introductions by Ray Colvig and Frank Thatcher. Berkeley, Calif.: University of California, c1990. Williams directed student activities for the ASUC (1957-1959)before becoming dean of men at Berkeley. He witnessed the beginnings of the Free Speech Movement as the Bancroft Avenue strip became a testing ground for student activists in the 1960s. He speaks about the ideals of the students and their protests in connection with free speech, the Vietnam War, and People's Park. It was his responsibility to carry out the administration's policies and often mete out discipline. His fairness and willingness to listen brought a balance to many difficult situations. In addition, he describes a typical day in the Dean of Students Office, focusing on the needs of students--tutorial help, housing, child care, access for physically disabled, transportation, etc. He also discusses his relationships with Chancellors Edward Strong, Roger Heyns, and Albert Bowker. Ruth Williams, the dean's wife, contributes a family perspective on the Free Speech Movement. She was president of Faculty Wives and an active participant in student work throughout her husband's career at the University.
