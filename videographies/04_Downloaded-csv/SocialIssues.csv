"America's War on Poverty. 57 min. each.","â€¢149;In This Affluent Society. In the early 1960s, hundreds of Kentucky coal miners are displaced by machines and strike out at their former employers. Millions of others displaced by machines across Appalachia and the rural South head north to begin a new life in Chicago, where they face overcrowded tenements and schools, and the familiar inequities of segregation. This program recounts these stories of desperation and hope and explores the origins of the federal government's war on poverty and how attitudes toward race and faith in the accessibility of the American dream shape the battle plans for the nation's greatest effort to reduce poverty.

Early 1965 is a critical period for President Johnson's war on poverty. The Office of Economic Opportunity's goal to have the poor themselves design and run anti-poverty programs attracts strong opposition from local and state governments. Head Start is created to provide poor children with adequate nutrition, health care and the educational advantages that other American children enjoy. This program focuses on the Head Start program in Mississippi.

The context for the war on poverty shifts after 1965. Urban rebellions provoke a sense of urgency for some, while others now see the war against poverty as hopeless. Increasingly, the media and the public equate poverty with inner-city black communities. This program looks at the anger and despair of the poor and the powerless, and the anger and frustration of the middle class at having to pay for ""others' mistakes."" It also examines attempts made in Newark, New Jersey, to reclaim the inner city through public/private partnerships.
