In Hindi with English subtitles. ca. 52 min. each installment.","â€¢149;Episode I: Introduction. Introduces the reporters and shows them engaged in preparatory research with visits to such sites as the ancient Kanheri caves and Jaipur's stone observatory Jantar Mantar. Also presented are interviews with archeologists B. B. Lal, excavator of sites mentioned in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, M. K. Dhavalikar who discusses indications of drought 3,000 years ago, and D. P. Agrawal who shows the process of carbon dating.

This second episode examines contemporary tribal communities who continue to practice certain stone age techniques: The use of stone tools, the gathering of forest products and cave paintings which reflect a prehunting ritual. An encounter with the nomadic Gujjar tribe helps illustrate ancient techniques which are still viable while preparations for a wazwaan feast in a Kashmir village and the Navratri celebrations in Bombay also illustrate ancient rituals which still exist today.

This third episode visits the Harappan civilazation. The discovery of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro altered the view that Indian history began with the Vedic age. The ruins at Lothal help recreate Harappan city planning and drainage systems, their crops and agricultural technology. Harappan overseas trade and navigational technology are discussed as well as their still undeciphered script. Visits are also made to Khetri, believed to be where the Harappans mined copper.

This fourth episode follows the social consequences of iron technology. The clearing of forests and improved agriculture with iron-tipped ploughs and spoked wheels laid the basis for new cities. This happened 1,000 years after the Harappan decline, in the basin of the Ganga. The megalithic culture, predominant in the South gives a more complete picture of the period. Bastar iron smelting today is almost identical to the megalithic technology. The city sites of Kaushambi and Rajgir are explored. The rise of brahminical orthodoxy is discussed, along with the geometry arising out of prescriptions for the construction of sacrificial altars.

This fifth episode opens with the grammarian Panini who attempted to systematise the rules of Bhasha, an early form of Sanskrit, a masterly achievement of logic, analysis and classification. At the site of Pondicherry, the trade with Rome is recalled. Cities and ports in the south developed during this period because of excellent irrigation systems: the simple etram, the temple tank and the Grand Anaicut on the Kaveri River. The Saraswati Mahal Library is a storehouse of many manuscripts first compiled during the period, which saw an almost universal condification of social, religious and philosophic thought, including the denial of basic rights to women and the lower castes.

This seventh episode examines a strange paradox: India is ahead of many regions in scientific and technolgical knowledge but invariably an impasse is reached. Thus the mathematics of early Indian astronomers is taken up centuries later in Europe. Alchemy arises in India, China and West Asia but it is Europe that gives birth to modern chemistry. The social reasons for this phenomenon are examined. Looks at the development of mathematics, particularly the zero and the place value notation system using the ten numerals. The technology of zinc and bronze metallurgy is explored and then images and statues in worship in Hindu temples as architecture becomes ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+8538"">Video/C 8538Ж","â€¢149;Episode VIII: Synthesis and growth, 1200 to 1600. This eighth episode describes society prior to the Turk and Afghan migrations. In the Sultanate period and later, feudalism became more deeply entranched, however the peasants and artisans were open to technological innovation. By the 16th century, the Portuguese founded their trading posts and missionaries carried out botanical studies and introduced the printing press. In the South there flourished the kingdom of Vijayanagar. Under Akbar the emerging cultural synthesis reached new heights with an explosion of exquisite crafts. The nobility encouraged horticulture and introduced many exotic fruits, even as India became renowned for its textiles.

This ninth episode opens with the Bhakti and Sufi movements which were gathering force as the Mughal empire dissolved into small kingdoms. The Renaissance in Europe travelled to India but left to individual noblemen, never acquired the dimensions of a social force. Meanwhile Indian-built ships were much in demand by the Europeans and Jaisingh was building the city of Jaipur. He reformed the calendar and built a number of astronomical observatories. Tipu Sultan of Mysore had a more integrated approach to social and technological change. He attempted to acquire the latest military technology, but with his defeat, a major threat to colonialism was removed.

This tenth episode opens with an examination of the battle of Plassey in 1757 and the ascendance of the British in India. Craft centers decayed as British-made goods flooded Indian markets and even the thriving steel industry in Telengana was affected. The East India Company conducted surveys of natural resources, leading to the development of raw material processing industries and the encouragement of crops useful to British industry. The railways were developed, helping to consolidate Britain's hold. The consequent discontent culminated with the 1857 war of independence. Yet the exposure to new ideas from the West had brought about a fresh awareness. The efforts of social reformers and educationists such as Ram Mohan Roy and Mahendra Lal Sircar are discussed.","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+8541"">Video/C 8541Ж","â€¢149;Episode XI: The Freedom Struggle and the Scientific Community, 1900 to 1947.This eleventh episode opens with India's freedom struggle at the start of the 20th century. The spread of education contributed to the growing national movement. The work of scientists such as J. C. Bose, P. C. Ray, Meghnad Saha and C. V. Raman is discussed in this context. These early scientists had a vision of a free India and many served on the Panning Committee founded by the Indian National Congress in 1938. Meanwhile, the plunder of India's natural resources continued and the story of coal is a typical example. Indian geologists and engineers came together against all odds, and demonstrated that Indian coal could be enriched by a washing process.

This twelfth episode looks at the challenges after India gained its independence and the role of the scientific community in regeneration of the country. The ""green revoution,"" often cited as an example of successful food production, is explored through interviews with farmers, an agricultural scientist and an economist. The proposed system of dams on the Narmada River and its ecological and social consequences is examined. The application of new technolgies has shown results, yet often the benefits are inequitable which points to the need for greater community participation in the development process. A recent example of people's involvement is the Baliraja Dam in Maharashtra, where people have formed a water users cooperative.

This final episode looks at the promise of technology for the future of India. It visits some villages in Udaipur where a voluntary organisation is training local people for afforestation programs. Then to Hoshangabad, where an experiment in teaching science in the field is under way. In Meerut, scene of repeated political disturbances, the circumstances behind such outbursts are analyzed. The mass media also has a responsiblity. P.C Joshi speaks of the gap between the original vision and the present reality of television. The film concludes with filmmakers visiting Prof. Yash Pal, who guided the making of this series with a conversation full of hope for the future of India.

But unlike the efforts to recruit Rosie the Riveter to the factory, this clandestine search targeted female mathematicians who would become human 'computers' for the U.S. Army. From the bombing of Axis Europe to the assaults on Japanese strongholds, women worked around-the-clock six days a week, creating ballistics tables that proved crucial to Allied success. Rosie made the weapons, but the female computers made them accurate. When the first electronic computer (ENIAC) was developed to aid the Army's calculation.

â€¢149;From Stone to Bronze. The program traces use of metals from the Stone Age through the Bronze Age. It visits Jaipur, India, goes on to the Sinai Desert and also examines recent archeological findings in Thailand. 
â€¢149;Swords and Plowshares. Episode tracing the collapse of the Bronze Age and the rise of a new metal - iron. From the ruins of the Hittite capital at Hattusa to the Roman mining operations at Rio Tinto in Spain, the program shows how the dominance of iron shifted the center of Western civilization from the Middle East to the Mediterranean. 
â€¢149;Shining Conquests. The program focuses on the remarkable influence that the hunger for precious metals, particularly gold, has had on human history. It begins at the Golden Horn at Istanbul, with the legend of the Argonauts and the Golden Fleece, and ends with the Gold Rushes that spurred exploration of the new World, and that helped create Australia. 
â€¢149;The Revolution of Necessity. The program focuses on the industrial revolution in Great Britain. It begins with Europe's first energy crisis, a shortage of wood in the 17th century because Europe's forests had been devastated to fire the furnaces of the Middle Ages. The resulting search for new energy sources turned England to the use of coal and coke, and this led to invention of the steam engine and the railroad. These two inventions transformed industrial society. The symbol of the era was steel - the Eiffel Tower. 
â€¢149;Into the Machine Age. Program focuses on the American Industrial Revolution, a new way of doing things that affected daily life in almost every Western country. It traces the exploitation of the New World's mineral riches and shows how the Sault Sainte Marie Canal brought the iron deposits of the midwest together with the coal deposits of the east to form the industrial heartland of America in places like Pittsburgh. 
â€¢149;From Alchemy to Atom. This program looks at the results of our ongoing speculation about the nature of metals from medieval alchemists to Marie Curie. It also traces the development of a new science - geology and explains how the curiosity about metals led Pierre and Marie Curie to investigate the nature of the atom. 
â€¢149;The Age of Metals, Can It Last? The final program explores questions of today: Will society accept the environmental penalties of increased metal-winning? Are there enough metals left on earth for all who want them? What will we do for energy? It also looks at specific examples of the environmental impact of mining, the recycling of metals, and new methods of exploration.
