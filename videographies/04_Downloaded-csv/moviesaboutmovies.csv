Reilly, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, Ian Holm, Danny Huston, Gwen Stefani, Jude Law, Adam Scott, Matt Ross, Kelli Garner, Frances Conroy, Brent Spiner, Stanley DeSantis, Edward Herrmann, Willem Dafoe. Follows the life of Howard Hughes as the twentysomething millionaire, having already made a fortune improving the design of oil-drilling bits, who comes to Hollywood with an interest in getting into the picture business. It doesn't take long for Hughes to jump from producer to director of his first major film project, a World War I air epic. The film was a massive hit, and the eccentric inventor became a mogul in Hollywood, making Jean Harlow a star and enjoying a romance with Katharine Hepburn. But Hollywood's old-boy network never fully accepted Hughes, and in time his passion for flying began to reclaim his attentions. In time he began designing new planes, setting air speed records, flying around the world, and risking his life testing aircraft. Hughes also found time to romance Ava Gardner and founded his own airline, Trans-World Airlines. As his ideas became bolder and more eccentric, he gained many powerful enemies. 170 min.

The footage is shot with a 1920s handcranking camera, in the style of silent films. 76 min.

But you know from the director's beret, his German rolling R's, his pencil-thin mustache and jodhpurs that there is no way this will happen. Daffy drenches everybody by plugging the sprinkler system into the lights, then loads machine-gun rounds into the hand-cranked camera, cuts in on a love scene with a Katharine Hepburn chicken, and appears in the director's turkey lunch. When they all go to lunch, Daffy decides to give them a real feature, a crazy newsreel grouping of live-action shots, with narration that doesn't match at all (including two seconds from Gold-Diggers of 1933). Daffy switches his film with the director's when Hamburger is about to screen it for Stupendous.

Daffy ""Dumas"" Duck has written his own screenplay which parodies The Scarlet Pimpernel and tries to sell it to ""J.L.,"" the studio head. The cartoon concerns itself less with ""The Scarlet Pimpernel,"" Baroness Emmuska Orczy's tale of an heroic figure who smuggles doomed noblemen out of Paris during the French Revolution, than with mocking swashbucklers in general and Errol Flynn in particular (Errol is mentioned no less than three times). Daffy plays the title character, a dashing highwayman (as Flynn) with an unspecified mission in life, except to irritate the Lord High Chamberlain (Porky as Claude Rains). The Chamberlain, realizing that his daughter Melissa is the Scarlet Pumpernickel's true love, arranges to marry her to the Grand Duke (Sylvester as Basil Rathbone), hoping that this will flush the Pumpernickel out of hiding. Elmer Fudd has a small part as the proprietor of the King's Nostril Inn. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eDVD+2073"">DVD 2073Ж","Movies About Filmmaking and Hollywood /

"You Ought To Be In Pictures(1940)","Directed by Friz Freleng. Warner Brothers. Animated short. ""As the clock strikes midday, the animators vanish from their desks, abandoning the studio to Porky and Daffy. Jealous of Porky's success in the Looney Tunes cartoon series, Daffy tricks Porky into quitting Looney Tunes and heading for the Warner Brothers lot to go after the big money in a career in live-action features. Poor Porky never gets through the front gate. Frustrated, Porky returns to Termite Terrace, where he sees Daffy trying to take over Porky's job. Porky takes the conniving duck into an empty studio and beats the living bejeezes out of him. He then heads over to real-life Looney Tunes producer Leon Schlesinger's office to try and get his job back. Schlesinger has kept Porky's contract in his desk, and he tells Porky that he'll always have a job at Termite Terrace.""
