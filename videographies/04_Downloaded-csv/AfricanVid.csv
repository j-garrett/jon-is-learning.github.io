"The Great Health Service Swindle.(Life; 5)","Explores why Ghanaian nurses have been leaving their country to work abroad, and what this ""brain drain"" means for the Ghanaian health care system. One widely quoted source says almost two thousand nurses left the country between 1995 and 2002. The exodus is set to continue as nurses opt to leave a crumbling health system to earn more abroad. In the UK, some nurses can earn more in a day than they could in a month back home. Spending on health in Ghana has gone up but its value has declined because of inflation. While most of that money goes to wages, patients have to pay because the health service operates on a ""user pays"" principle, the so-called ""cash and carry"" system. The stresses of this system is one reason health workers leave. Filmed & directed by Kim Hopkins. 2005. 26 min.
