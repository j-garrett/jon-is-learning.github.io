Describes Massieu's frustrated pleas to his father to be allowed to attend school, the kindness of a stranger that lead to his early education in Bordeau under the abbe Sicard and several dramatic examples of Massieu's decades-long friendship with and loyalty to the abbe Sicard.

As the successor to the Abbe de l'Epee, Sicard, along with Massieu, presented a petition to the French National Assembly and obtained a permanent home for the school--Saint-Jacques.

Focus is upon oralism, the concept that the only proper route for educating deaf students is oral instruction. A central figure in the oralist controversy is Jacob Rodrigue Pereire.

This episode is ""a record of the efforts of hearing people to supplant the language of the deaf with their language, to replace signs with speech."" 33 min.

This film focuses on Abbe de L'Epee, and the beginning of world wide education for deaf people. The chance encounter between Abbe de L'Epee and two deaf sisters launched him on his career with deaf students and inspired the abbe to begin his school. What is remarkable is that this occurred in an age when the majority view was that deaf people had no abstract ideas, no memory and, of course, no language. ""Fortunately, Eppe's independence of spirit kept him from adopting the prevailing views uncritically."" 28 min.

Describes attempts to eradicate and eliminate the language and society of the deaf that had been nurtured at the American Asylum in Hartford. Horace Mann and Samuel Gridley Howe, self-proclaimed social reformers, squandered time, effort and money on the surface appearance of oral language rather than on the true bedrock of intellectual development.

This final film of the series is reported from the perspective of Harlan Lane concerning his views on the current situation for deaf persons. He believes that the congress held by the Pereire Society in 1880 in Milan was ""the single most critical event which released a tidal wave or oralism which resulted in the submersion of sign language and signing communities. He feels the dominance of oralism and the supression of signing have resulted in the limited educational achievement of today's deaf men and women, 80% of whom, in America, are engaged in manual or unskilled labor."" 24 min.
