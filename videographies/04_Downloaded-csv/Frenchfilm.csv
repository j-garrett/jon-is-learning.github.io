"[Absinthe] The Four Earliest Known Absinthe-related Films","Presents four movies from the silent film era concerning the distilled, highly alcoholic spirit absinthe. Almost from the very outset motion picture producers found a lucerative niche producing films with an anti-alcohol message. The 1902 film ""Les victimes de l'alcoolisme"" was the first attempt by the newly formed Pathé company to exploit the burgeoning demand for anti-absinthe and anti-alcohol propaganda. ""Les Victimes de l'alcool"" (1911), a far more sophisticated film, was enthusiastically promoted by the temperance movement and was a huge success for Pathé. ""Absinthe"" (1913) is the only surviving U.S.-made absinthe related motion picture from the pre-ban era, featuring one of the very few filmed versions of absinthe being prepared and consumed. Contents: La Bonne absinthe / produced by Gaumont Film Company ; directed by Alice Guy (1899, 1 min.) -- Les Victimes de l'alcoolisme / produced by Pathé ; directed by Ferdinand Zecca (1902, 4 min.) -- Les Victimes de l'alcool / produced by Pathé ; directed by Gerard Bourgeois (1911, 26 min.) -- Absinthe / produced by the Gem Motion Picture Company ; starring Glen White and Sadie Weston (1913, 12 min.)

Le Bal takes place in a hypothetical Parisian dance hall and its plot is communicated entirely through mime, its pop music soundtrack and period ballroom dances. The prologue section, set in present time, introduces viewers to the cast of characters. The music begins and in a series of flashback sequences that use key moments in modern French history as their backdrop, viewers are presented with a clever yet poignant social commentary of prewar, postwar and modern times. 107 min.

As his family grows suspicious of his evasive behavior, Vincent is forced to spin a new tale, pretending to get a job working for the U.N. In a bid to keep the money coming in, he recruits old friends to invest in an imaginary emerging-markets investment scheme. Vincent also falls in with Jean-Michel, a black market dealer whose ignominious past serves as an ominous warning for Vincent's present course.

With this collection of more than 60 films, culled from the world's leading archives and carefully mastered, Guy may no longer be seen as a ""woman filmmaker.""

Best remembered today for his espionage serials Les Vampires and Fantômas, Louis Feuillade had a more varied and profound influence upon French cinema than many of his followers realize. For more than a decade, he was the artistic director at Gaumont, encouraging the rise of such filmmakers as Abel Gance and Léonce Perret. This collection of films offers a wider view of Feuillade's directorial efforts -- but, admittedly, it is only a small portion of the nearly 800 films he is believed to have directed.","â€¢149;Disc 3: This collection looks at pioneering French filmmakers from the Gaumont studio, with extensive examples of their work. Until now, the films of Léonce Perret have been virtually unseen in the United States, yet he was a hugely influential figure in the growth of the French film industry. As an actor, he appeared in more than 100 films from 1909 to 1916, including the long-running series of ""Léonce"" comedies. But his greater contribution was as a director who set the standard to which other French filmmakers aspired. His films had a technical mastery and aesthetic grace that allowed them to reveal subtleties of character and meaning.","Le Gendarme à New York (1965)","Directed by Jean Girault.

""This extraordinary little movie emerges from the then recently formed French Dziga Vertov film collective, led by Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Pierre Gorin. The collective produced a number of provocative films that show a distinct move away from the more 'middle class' narratives of a film like Pierrot le fou (Godard, 1965). In Letter to Jane, a single news photograph (see further discussion below) first appears on the screen: it is of Jane Fonda towering above some Vietnamese, and on the sound track Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Pierre Gorin discuss the implications of the photograph. Their talk is didactic, and reveals what Laura Mulvey referred to later as Godard's ""always interesting"" misogyny (quoted in Williams 1992: 84). Certainly the intensity of a film consisting of a still picture and two ideologues berating the subject of the picture has something of the feeling of a show trial about it. The Marxist/Maoist Dziga Vertov movement and Jane Fonda's own short career as a bourgeois idealist collide in what in retrospect is a film by two rather privileged intellectuals who both seem to lack a sense of history's ironies.""
