"Civilization and Climate (Climate & Man ; 3).","Changing climate probably played the decisive role in drawing hominids out of the trees, up on their hind legs, and off in search of food whose supply had been dispersed by the replacement of rain forests by rasslands. Migrations were motivated by the search for food; during ice ages, when sea levels dropped, new areas became accessible and populations spread. Links between climatic changes and emerging civilizations have also been postulated; the collapse of civilizations confronted with climatic challenges to which they could not or would not adapt is clearly documented. 26 min.

Featuring astronomer George Abell and others.","â€¢149; As Surely as Columbus Saw America. Newton's laws of motion and universal gravitation are shown to apply in the heavens and on earth. They lead to the discovery of a new planet, Neptune, which scientists locate mathematically and then by telescope. The courses of Voyager I and II through the solar system are graphically depicted: the ultimate application of Newtonian principles.

Deals with Einstein's special theory of relativity and its impact on the development of modern physics. Einstein points out a conflict between the electromagnetic theories of Maxwell and the laws of Newton. From Maxwell's theory that the speed of light is an absolute constant to all observers, regardless of their motion in respect to one another, Einstein develops his special theory of relativity.

"What Time Is It?","Do we really know what time it is? CERN physicist Professor Brian Cox (and author of E=mc2) unlocks the secrets of time in this entertaining and informative program. His journey starts with the Sun, our historical dictator of time, but Brian discovers that the world doesn't always spin like clockwork -- in fact, it flutters, like an irregular heartbeat. In his search for a more reliable way to tell the time, he experiences the physical definition of a second with a cesium atomic clock, then jets across the Atlantic to discover that time can speed up or slow down depending on how near an object is to a strong gravitational field. Still looking for answers, he consults modern ideas like string theory and quantum mechanics that are pointing the way to future breakthroughs.
