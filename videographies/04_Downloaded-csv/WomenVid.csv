"Behind the Labels","Lured by false promises and driven by desperation, thousands of Chinese and Filipina women pay high fees to work in garment factories on the pacific island of Saipan, the only U.S. territory exempt from labor and immigration laws.

By using the latest images from NASA satellites, the film investigates the consequences of the U.S. military presence in South East Asia as well as European migration politics. This video-essay takes an earthly perspective on cross-border circuits, where women have emerged as key actors and expertly links new geographic technologies to the sexualization and displacement of women on a global scale. By revealing how technologies of marginalization affect women in their sexuality, REMOTE SENSING aspires to displace and resignify the feminine within sexual difference and cultural representation.

"Science for Survival. (Woman's Place)","Activist and ecologist Vandana Shiva is the leader of a people's movement in India that opposes ""reductionist Western science"". She argues that the failure of the Green Revolution was due to the fact that women's knowledge of traditional seed varieties was ignored. Shiva is devoting her scientific knowledge to proving that local farming methods, which recognize diversity and complexity in their polycultures, are vital to the survival of the Indian ecosystem.

"Hot Wax (Real stories from a free South Africa; v. 1)","Ivy is a big, bubbly black woman who managed to run her own beauty salon surreptitiously during the dark days of apartheid. She lives in Alexandra, a restless and poor township, while her white, mostly elderly, clients live in the tree-lined suburbs of Johannesburg. In her salon she is part beautician, long-time friend, lay counselor and honest commentator to her customers. While she masks her clients' imperfections, she also peels away layers of difference separating the races. It can be easily pointed out that Ivy essentially enjoys the intimacy of a domestic servant, while her white clients maintain their economic privileges and know little about Ivy's private world.

"Kumari: Living Goddess of Nepal","In Nepal an ancient tradition survives to this day : young girls are chosen to become goddesses and taken away from their families to live in a temple where people come to worship them and pray for good fortune. In a country where girls are seen as second class citizens, the worshipping of a girl child could be seen as a positive role model, but some are adamant that the tradition should be stopped as the young girls miss out on their family and school life and suffer serious psychological problems as a result. This film looks at the life of three young goddesses and explores the debates for and against this unique tradition. A film by Tassia Kobylinska. c2005. 27 min.

"The Long-haired Warriors","Vietnamese women have a long and legendary tradition of fierce warriorship -- a tradition exemplified in recent history by their wholehearted participation in the struggles against the French, the South Vietnamese Regular Army, and the American military. Ultimately, they shared in all those victories, but none came without painful losses and sorrows. This provocative documentary introduces a number of Vietnamese women who were active in the National Liberation Front, or Viet Cong, and shows how their wartime experiences shaped the rest of their lives. A highlight of the film is an emotional visit with four former prisoners to the infamous Con Dao prison camp where, from 1968 to 1975, they were among 600 women -- some as young as 15 years old -- kept in ""tiger cages"" and subjected to frequent torture and abuse by the American-supported South Vietnamese military forces. From disparate perspectives, these women universally express the conviction that their stories can provide a common thread of compassion to bind the wounds that divide people in the U.S. and Vietnam. They feel a bond with American wives and mothers who have also suffered profound losses. This engaging film examines the lives of some of America's former enemies and illuminates some surprising parallels and contrasts between their world and the world of the American filmmaker who seeks to discover their stories. It will stimulate discussion in a variety of courses in women's studies, Asian studies, and history. Produced by Mel Halbach. 1998. 60 min.

"Dying to Leave","Explores the current worldwide boom in illicit migration. Every year, an estimated two to four million people are shipped in containers, shepherded through sewage pipes, secreted in car chassis, and ferried across frigid waters. Others travel on legitimate carriers but with forged documents. An alarming number of these migrants end up in bondage, forced to work as prostitutes, thieves, or as laborers in sweatshops. By listening to the voices of those who pulled up their roots, who risked all, this documentary puts a human face on what might otherwise be seen as statistical, overwhelming and remote. Focusing on five major stories whose journeys traverse 16 countries from Colombia to China, from Mexico to Moldova this film looks into the circumstances that drove these migrants from their homes, describes the difficulties involved in their epic journeys and reveals what awaits them in their new world.
