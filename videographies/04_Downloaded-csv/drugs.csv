"Alcohol in the MoviesЖ","[Absinthe] The Four Earliest Known Absinthe-related Films","Presents four movies from the silent film era concerning the distilled, highly alcoholic spirit absinthe. Almost from the very outset motion picture producers found a lucerative niche producing films with an anti-alcohol message. The 1902 film ""Les victimes de l'alcoolisme"" was the first attempt by the newly formed Pathé company to exploit the burgeoning demand for anti-absinthe and anti-alcohol propaganda. ""Les Victimes de l'alcool"" (1911), a far more sophisticated film, was enthusiastically promoted by the temperance movement and was a huge success for Pathé. ""Absinthe"" (1913) is the only surviving U.S.-made absinthe related motion picture from the pre-ban era, featuring one of the very few filmed versions of absinthe being prepared and consumed. Contents: La Bonne absinthe / produced by Gaumont Film Company ; directed by Alice Guy (1899, 1 min.) -- Les Victimes de l'alcoolisme / produced by Pathé ; directed by Ferdinand Zecca (1902, 4 min.) -- Les Victimes de l'alcool / produced by Pathé ; directed by Gerard Bourgeois (1911, 26 min.) -- Absinthe / produced by the Gem Motion Picture Company ; starring Glen White and Sadie Weston (1913, 12 min.)

"Bank Dick (1940)","Directed by Eddie Cline. Cast: W.C. Fields, Una Merkel, Cora Witherspoon, Franklin Pangborn, Shemp Howard, Grady Sulton. Egbert Souse accidently foils a bank robbery and is hired as a bank guard. ""How could you pick a single performance from the late, great W.C. Fields to honor? He essentially played a drunk wallowing in some state of dysfunction or another in every movie he made. Perhaps our favorite for the purposes of the drunk list? His role as Egbert Souse ('soo-say!') in The Bank Dick, a classic Fields film by any measure. The quotes attributed to Fields (in character and out of it) are a running homage to drinking, including his classic line: 'A woman drove me to drink and I didn't even have the decency to thank her.' No, W.C. Thank you.""

"La Bonne Absinthe (1899)","Directed by Alice Guy. Long thought lost, this tiny flickering fragment from the dawn of film history - just 56 seconds long - is the earliest filmed version of an absinthe being prepared and drunk. Directed by the pioneer female director Alice Guy it tells a short, comical story: a man walks into a café, orders an absinthe, the waiter brings a bottle and adds a large dose to his glass, the man adds water from a carafe in an absent minded way while reading his newspaper, not realising that he's missing the glass entirely. Without looking he takes a deep drink, and almost chokes on the undiluted alcohol. In a rage he starts attacking the waiter with his cane. The waiter chases him away with a soda syphon, to the great amusement of the other onlookers. 56 sec.

Meanwhile, the family waits. He arrives home late and abusive. The next day, hung over, he takes much less convincing to have the drinks; he's gone so long that his wife sends a daughter looking for him.

""Pop"" Kenton, Robert McKenzie, Nora Cecil, George Irving. Sam Bisbee is an inventor who is the laughingstock in his small town. After demonstrating another failed invention, he meets a princess who promises to use her celebrity to turn his luck around. ""Although W.C. Fields drank immoderately on and off camera, he rarely played a scene in which he appeared pie-eyed drunk. The major exception can be found in You’re Telling Me, the first sound film in which the Great Man was given the solo lead. The movie opens with a masterful drunk scene, in which Fields staggers home, removes his shoes to avoid waking his wife, loses his hat repeatedly, and has to resort to using a funnel to insert his key into the keyhole. Once indoors, he gets caught in the decorative ropes that hang from the hallway curtains and nearly strangles himself in his efforts to become disentangled.""

""Film adaptation of street tough Jim Carroll's epistle about his kaleidoscopic free fall into the harrowing world of drug addiction. As a member of a seemingly unbeatable high school basketball squad, Jim's life centers around the basketball court and the court becomes a metaphor for the world in his mind. A best friend who is dying of leukemia, a coach (""Swifty"") who takes unacceptable liberties with the boys on his team, teenage sexual angst, and an unhealthy appetite for heroin -- all of these begin to encroach on young Jim's dream of becoming a basketball star. Soon, the dark streets of New York become a refuge from his mother's mounting concern for her son. He can't go home and his only escape from the reality of the streets is heroin for which he steals, robs and prostitutes himself. Only with the help of Reggie, an older neighborhood friend with whom Jim ""picked up a game"" now and then, is he able to begin the long journey back to sanity.""

"I Love You Alice B. Toklas(1968)","Directed by Hy Averback. Cast: Peter Sellers, Jo Van Fleet, Leigh Taylor-Young, Joyce Van Patten. One day you're a career 9-to-5er with a pending marriage, and then next you know, you chuck it all for beads, bell-bottoms and free love. This is the life of Harold Fine, a dedicated lawyer about to become a more dedicated dropout. ""Films such as I Love You Alice B. Toklas! (1968) and Easy Rider (1969) can be used to demonstrate the changing attitude towards drug culture during the 1960's and 1970's. Marijuana was commuted, as were the laws surrounding its possession, from ""killer weed"" to ""drop-out weed."" As it became popular with middle-class white university students, its stigma was diminished greatly; so much so that it was decriminalised in eleven U.S. states. It is during this period that marijuana is portrayed openly in films as a peaceful and even enlightening natural substance. I Love You, Alice B. Toklas is a charming comedy focusing on the mid-life crisis of the main character played by Peter Sellers. He meets a sweet flower child and is introduced to the hippie world of counterculture and pot. As Frank Thompson, in his article, ""Movies on Drugs"", writes, ""marijuana is an entirely positive force in Toklas; everyone who uses it (even unwittingly Sellers' aging parents) emerges more thoughtful, aware, spontaneous - freer."" I was hard-pressed to find films in any of the other historical periods that portray pot in such a benevolent light. Even Cheech and Chong are shown to be at best dull-witted and slow.""

The first of the fourteen Sherlock Holmes films starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. The final scene represents the only reference any of the 14 films made to Holmes' ""seven-percent"" cocaine habit as Rathbone asks Bruce to retrieve ""the needle."" The scene, criticized as too risque by 1939 audiences, caused the film's producers to make a conscious decision to omit any additional mention of Holmes' recreational drug use in future outings. 80 min.

Cast: Robert Stephens, Colin Blakely, Genevieve Page, Christopher Lee. ""It's easy to see what Wilder loved about Holmes. Brilliant, irascible, witty, impatient, cultured and cynical, Holmes was a bundle of the same paradoxes as Wilder himself. Holmes' cocaine addiction, included as an aside in several Holmes stories, fascinated Wilder, as the very symbol of decadence. Here, Holmes' needle points to the curiosities and bizarre, even diabolical behavior which walks the streets of Victorian London, just as Wilder's Berlin of the 1920's had hosted its own happy perversions and fin-de-siecle revels.""

What ensues is a tale of music, sex, drugs, larger-than-life characters, and the birth of one of the most famous dance clubs in the world, The Hacienda - a mecca for clubbers as famous as the likes of Studio 54. Graphically depicting the music and dance heritage of Manchester from the late 70's to the early 90's, this comedy documents the vibrancy that made Mad-chester the place in the world that you would most like to be.""

Maniac offers a walking tour through the mind of a bona fide lunatic, distorted by fragmented scenes and ugly realities that mimic insanity's own warped perspective. This is actually a Depression-era rendition of Edgar Allan Poe's ""The Black Cat,"" injected with catfights, nudity, necrophilia, and the ingestion of one fresh eyeball.
