"The Childhood of Maxim Gorky (Detstvo Gorkogo) (1938)","Director, Mark Donski. Cast: Alexei Lyarsky, Varvara Massalitinova, Mikhail Troyansky, J. Alexeyeva. The Childhood of Maxim Gorky (Detstvo Gorkovo) was the first of Russian director Mark Donski's trilogy based upon Gorky's memoirs.

Continually demeaned by his martinet grandfather, Maxim is drawn to his warm-hearted grandmother, who instills in him the willingness to pursue his writing muse. Gorky's (and Donski's) deep abiding love for Russia is conveyed through the film's remarkably romanticist landscape shots along the Volga River. Includes the silent short ""Moscow clad in snow"" (5 min.), featuring documentary scenes of Moscow from 1909, filmed for Pathe Frères. 86 min.

"Little Vera (Malenkaya Vera) (1988)","Directed by Vasily Pichul. Cast: Natalya Negoda, Andrei Sokolov, Yuri Nazarov, Lyudmila Zajtseva, Aleksandr Negreba, Aleksandra Tabakova. The title character of the Russian Little Vera is a headstrong teenage girl, played by Natalya Negoda. To the dismay of her parents, Vera lives only for the moment, making no provision for her future. She'd rather hang out at local cafes in garish makeup and provocative clothing. A chance meeting with handsome student Sergei (Andrei Sokolov) develops into a sexual relationship. Her parents send out Vera's brother (Alexander Alexeyev-Negreba) to talk some sense into her. This proves doubly dicey when it turns out that the brother is an old acquaintance of the rebellious Sergei. Vera lies that she's gotten pregnant by Sergei, so he obligingly marries her and moves in with her family, which serves only to make matters worse. Vera's drunken father (Yuri Nazarov) ends up stabbing his son-in-law. Persuaded to lie about the incident to keep her father out of jail, Vera takes her family's side. A last-minute tragedy is barely averted, but we get the distinct feeling that Vera's problems with her family in particular and her life in general are far from over [synopsis from Ѭ href=""http://allmovie.com/"">All-Movie GuideЖ] 110 min. ; ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eDVD+8369"">DVD 8369Ж, Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/evhs+999:379"">vhs 999:379Ж","â€¢149;Ѭ href=""http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0095574/"">Credits and other information from the Internet Movie DatabaseЖ

"One Day in the Life of Andrei Arsenevich (1999)","Widely regarded as one of the greatest filmmakers of the 20th century, this is a homage to post-War Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky by his friend and colleague renowned French filmmaker Chris Marker. Marker draws parallels between Tarkovsky's life and films, offering an original insight into the usually reclusive director. Incorporating extensive film clips, journal entries, personal musings, and behind-the-scenes footage of Tarkovsky obsessively commanding his entire crew and of candid moments with his friends and family, this is a personal and loving portrait of the monumental filmmaker. 55 min.

"Sergei Eisenstein Mexican Fantasy (Meksikanskaya fantasiya)Ж(Russia, 1998)","Directed by Oleg Kovalov. Left unfinished by Eisenstein, the film (originally to be titled: Que viva Mexico and produced in 1938)) was highly structured, and was to consist of four ""novellas"" or ""scenarios"" plus a prologue and epilogue. The precise order and content of these episodes was constantly changing, but the overall film would trace the history of Mexico from precolonial times through Spanish conquest to contemporary times. Each episode has its own distinct style, is dedicated to a different Mexican artist, and also bases itself on some primal element (stone, water, iron, fire, air). The soundtrack in each case features a different Mexican folk song. A very rare film, this is not a re-working by another filmmaker, but the original film itself. 100 min.

"Battleship Potemkin (Bronenosets Potemkin) (1925)","Director, Sergei M. Eisenstein. Thanks to the success of his earlier Strike, director Sergei Eisenstein was commissioned by the Soviet government to make a film commemorating the Uprising of 1905. Eisenstein's scenario, boiled down from what was to have been a multipart epic of the occasion, focussed on the crew of the Battleship Potemkin. Fed up with the extreme cruelties of their officers-and their maggot -- ridden meat rations -- the sailors stage a violent mutiny. This, in turn, sparks an abortive citizen revolt against the Czarist regime. The film's centerpiece is stage upon the Odessa Steps, where in 1905 the Czar's Cossacks methodically shot down and hacked up rioters and innocent bystanders alike. To Eisenstein, this single bloody incident was the chrysalis of the successful 1917 Bolshevik revolution; thus, he poured his heart and soul into the Odessa Steps episode. The result was what many film historians consider the most famous sequence ever filmed; it is certainly one of the most imitated, as witness Brian DePalma's The Untouchables (1987). This triumph of Eisenstein's ""rhythmical editing"" technique is in the middle of film; it is not the climax, as many who've never seen Potemkin automatically assume. Incredibly, the sequence is actually topped by Eisenstein's jubilant finale, wherein the sailors of Imperial Navy, in solidarity with their comrades, disregard orders to fire upon the Potemkin. Their pivotal decision is symbolized by the legendary ""waking lions"" montage (Eisenstein isn't too subtle, but boy was he effective!) The two major sequences in Battleship Potemkin can still bring an audience to its feet even when taken out of context. Considering the intensity of their performances, it is astonishing to learn that all the actors in the film were amateurs, selected by Eisenstein because of ""rightness"" for roles. Pictorial quality varies from print to print, but even in a duped-down version, Battleship Potemkin is must-see cinema.

"The Cigarette girl of Mosselprom (Papirosnitsa ot Mosselproma) (1924)","Director, Yuri Zhelyabuzhsky. Cast: Yuliya Solntseva, Igor Ilyinsky, Nikolai Tsereteli, Anna Dmokhovskaya, M. Tsybulsky. A charming, silent romantic comedy that tells the tale of a young man who falls in love with the title character. She becomes a famous film star and herself falls in love, not with the hero, but with her cameraman. No one ever gets what he or she truly wants, though they continue to pursue their lost dreams to the bitter end. Reveling in the unexpected throughout, it is capped by an adroit surprise ending.

"Mother ('Mat') (1926)","Directed by Vsevolod I. Pudovkin. Mother (Mat) was the first of Russian-filmmaker Vsevold Pudovkin's ""personal epics""-films that weave spectacular historical tales while never losing sight of the individual, and individual emotions, that motivate those tales. Based on a Maxim Gorky story, Mother recreates the abortive Russian revolution of 1905. The title character, played by Vera Baranovkskaya, is the unwitting cause of the imprisonment of her political-activist son Nikolai Batalov. When her boy is killed in an escape attempt, she is awakened to the horrors of the Czarist regime, and picks up Batalov's political cudgel. She too, is killed while participating in a worker's protest. The sweep and scope of the action scenes in Mother never dwarf the human story. What sticks in the mind most vividly is the intimate scene in which Batalov, contemplating his upcoming release from prison, begins dreaming of his mother, while superimposed closeups of her face blend into lyrical shots of the Russian spring thaw. Mother was the first of Pudovkin's trilogy of Revolution-inspired silent masterpieces: the subsequent films were End of St. Petersburg and Storm over Asia.

"Strike (Stachka) (1924)","Directed by Sergei Eisenstein. Performed by the First Workers' Theatre of Proletkult: Grigorii Aleksandrov, Maksim Shtraukh, Mikhail Gomorov, Y. Glizer, Ivan Kliukvin, Aleksandr Antonov. The first full-length feature project of pantheon Russian filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein, Strike is a government-commissioned celebration of the unrealized 1905 Bolshevik revolution. The story is set in motion by a series of outrages and humiliations perpetrated on the workers of a metalworks plant. The Czarist regime is unsympathetic to the workers, characteristically helping the plant owners to subjugate the hapless victims. Finally, the workers revolt, staging an all-out strike. Here is where Eisenstein's theory of ""the montage of shocks"" was given its first major workout. While the notion of juxtaposing short, separate images to heighten tension and excitement was not new, Eisenstein was the first to fully understand the value of using sudden-shock images (a bloody face, a fired weapon, a descending club) to make his dramatic and sociological points. Playing to mixed reviews and small audiences in Russia, Strike proved a success worldwide, assuring Eisenstein complete creative freedom on his next project, the immortal Potemkin.

"Ten Days that Shook the WorldЖ (October = Oktiabr) (1928)","Directed by Sergei Eisenstein. Borrowing its title from a book by American communist John Reed (of Reds fame), Sergei Eisenstein's Ten Days That Shook the World reenacts the crucial week-and-a-half in October, 1918, when the Russian Kerensky regime was toppled by the Bolsheviks. While Eisenstein takes certain liberties in characterization--those opposing the Bolsheviks are depicted as mental defectives or grossly overweight clowns--his re-creation of such events as the storming of the Winter Palace are painstakingly meticulous. The ""actor"" playing Lenin, a nonprofessional worker named Nikandrov, so closely resembles the genuine article that the effect is positively eerie. So authentic is Eisenstein's reconstruction of events that, for years, TV documentaries have been passing off clips from Ten Days That Shook the World as ""actual"" scenes of the Revolution. While impressive on a technical level, the film never truly stirs the audience's emotions; Eisenstein purists have argued that this ""alienation"" technique was the director's intention all along, forcing the viewer to observe the events intellectually rather than emotionally. Produced in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the October Revolution, Ten Days That Shook the World was initially titled October.

"Zvenigora (Zakoldavanoye Mesto) (1928)","Directed by Alexander Dovzhenko. An allegory in which the central theme is the relationship of an old man with his two sons, one bad, one good, searching for treasure buried in the hill of Zvenigora. The good son represents the progressive social order for which the revolution strove; the bad son represents the chaos of any major social upheaval. Zvenigora is less a film than a tone poem, set forth by master Russian cinematic poet Alexander Dovzhenko. Moving outside the studio system for the first time (it was his fourth film), Dovzhenko uses lyrical location shots of rural Ukraine and its farmers to excellent advantage. The very complex storyline (too much so to dwell on at great length here) combines elements of fact and folklore in relating the ""history"" the Ukraine, using the search for a fabled treasure as the glue that holds the tale together. This is not an accessible ""classroom classic"" like Eisenstein's Potemkin. Be prepared to think and be challenged, and not to sit back comfortably, while experiencing Zvenigora.

"Ecstasy (Ekstase)(Czechoslovakia / Austria, 1933)","Directed by Gustav Machatý. Cast: Hedy Lamarr, Aribert Moog, Leopold Kramer, Jaromir Rogoz. Eva has just gotten married to an older gentleman, but discovers that he is obsessed with order in his life and doesn't have much room for passion. She becomes despondent and leaves him, returning to her father's house. One day while bathing in the lake she meets a young man and they fall in love. The husband has become grief stricken at the loss of his young bride, and fate brings him together with the young lover that has taken Eva from him. The film was highly controversial in its time largely because of a nude swimming scene. It is also perhaps the first non-pornographic movie to portray sexual intercourse,[2] although never showing more than the actors' faces. It has also been called the first on-screen depiction of a female orgasm.

An aging Jewish doctor is forbidden to practice medicine in Prague during the Nazi occupation. He is employed in a warehouse as a clerk, cataloguing confiscated Jewish property.

The doctor hides him in his run-down apartment building as he sneaks through the black-market underworld of Prague in search of morphine to ease the man's pain, ever fearful of informant neighbors and vigilant authorities.

"Firemen's Ball (Horí, má Panenko) (1967)","Director, Milos Forman. Firemen's Ball was Czechoslovakian director Milos Forman's final film in his home country; he was scouting locations in Paris when the Russians moved their tanks into Prague in 1968 causing Forman to decide to remain an expatriate. Because of the supercharged political climate of the era, critics read all sorts of allegory and hidden meanings into the Firemen's Ball. Other critics simply accepted the film as the slapsticky tale of a disastrous small-town celebration in honor of a retiring fire chief, and laughed accordingly. Best to judge for oneself: you can catch Firemen's Ball under its original English title, or under its alternate cognomen Like a House on Fire.

"Before the Rain (A Tale in Three Parts) (Republic of Macedonia | France | UK, 1994)","Director, Milcho Manchevski. Cast: Rade Serbedzija, Katrin Cartlidge, Labina Mitevska, Gregoire Colin. The first film made in the newly independent Republic of Macedonia, Milcho Manchevski’s Before the Rain crosscuts the stories of an orthodox Christian monk , a British photo agent and a native Macedonian war photographer to paint a portrait of simmering ethnic and religious hatred about to reach its boiling point. Made during the strife of the war-torn Balkan states in the nineties, this gripping triptych of love and violence is also a timeless evocation of the loss of pastoral innocence, and remains one of recent cinema’s most powerful laments on the futility of war.
