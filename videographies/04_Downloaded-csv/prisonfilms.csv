In the midst of the brutality and despair, he makes a valuable discovery--that what the downtrodden need most is laughter. ""Perhaps more than any other Sturges movie, Sullivan's Travels commits itself to extreme changes in mood and tone. The chase scene, and Lake's sped-up sprint through a backlot in hoop skirt and bloomers, are pure slapstick. At the other extreme is a chain-gang sequence of shocking realism for 1941 Hollywood.""

"Scum (UK, 1979)","Director, Alan Clarke. Originally commissioned in 1977 for the BBC's Play for Today series, but banned by the BBC before transmission. Writer Roy Minton approached Alan Clarke to have his social commentary screenplay remade as a feature film consisting of a largely unknown cast. Young juvenile offender Carlin is sent to a remote prison for boys. Upon arrival he finds a brutal authoritarian system completely uninterested in reforming any of the young charges; equally treacherous is the inmate hierarchy which he must learn to navigate. Carlin quickly ascends to the role of 'Daddy' or top dog, but not at a small price. Unfortunately others are not so savvy and fall afoul of the social system, leading to beatings, a brutal rape, a bloody suicide, and a vicious climactic revolt. 98 min.

She depicts the lives of Iran's lost generation in the two decades since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, using the claustrophobic life of women behind bars as a metaphor for the entire society. Her protagonist, Mitra, is in prison for killing her violent stepfather. On the eve of a prison riot she confronts Tahereh, the new warden, whose dogmatic views she challenges fearlessly. Over the course of the next 20 years, Tahereh's attitude toward her prisoners changes and oftens, which reflects the country's shifting political stance. Eventually Mitra, aged and exhausted, is finally released, but Tahereh left behind, is now more like a prisoner herself. 106 min.
