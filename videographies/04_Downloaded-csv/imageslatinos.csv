"Flying Down to Rio (1933)","Directed by Thornton Freeland. Cast: Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Delores Del Rio, Gene Raymond, Raul Roulien. This film, containing the first of many Fred Astaire - Ginger Rogers partnerships, concerns a troupe of entertainers stranded in Rio. Songs include ""The Carioca,"" ""Orchids in the Moonlight,"" and the title song. Notable for a brilliantly photographed finale with chorus girls on the wings of flying airplanes, the movie was the musical that broke with the rather contrived Busby Berkeley productions and moved toward a closer integration of musical and narrative elements. Astaire's dance numbers come not as interruptions but as extensions of the plot.

"Giant (1956)","Directed by George Stevens. Cast: Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, James Dean, Carroll Baker, Jane Withers, Chill Wills, Mercedes McCambridge, Sal Mineo, Dennis Hopper, Judith Evelyn, Paul Fix. Bick Benedict, his society-gilded wife and three generations of land-rich Texas sons and daughters love, swagger, connive and clash in a monumental drama of family strife, racial bigotry and conflict between cattle barons and newly-rich oil tycoons. A major subplot concerns the racism against Mexican Americans in Texas. When the movie starts, Bick and Luz are racist towards the Mexicans who work on their ranch, which upsets Leslie. By the end of the movie, though, Bick realizes the wrongs of racism and defends his daughter-in-law and grandson, Juana and Jordan Benedict IV respectively, and earns Leslie's respect. Another subplot involves the liberation and striving for equal respect of women, as embodied in Leslie's defiance in having her beliefs controlled by Bick, precipitating her separating from him for a spell.

Feature-length audio commentary by film critic Stephen Farber, screenwriter Ivan Moffat and George Stevens Jr., introduction by George Stevens Jr.; documentary ""George Stevens : filmmakers who knew him""; scene access.

"Speedy Gonzales (animated character)","Speedy Gonzales (or Gonzlez), ""the fastest mouse in all Mexico"", is an animated cartoon mouse from the Warner Brothers Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons. Speedy's major traits are his ability to run extremely fast, and his comedic Mexican accent. He usually wears an oversized yellow sombrero and a white shirt and pants. (Ѭ href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedy_Gonzales"">WikipediaЖ)
In the late 1990's, Speedy was also featured in a program on the cable TV Cartoon Network. The cartoon was eventually taken off the air because of what network officials described as excessive smoking and drinking by the cartoon's characters and low viewership. In the wake of this decision, the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) called for reinstatement of the cartoons because, according to Gabriela Lemus, the director of policy and legislation for LULAC, ""Speedy's a cultural icon. He's a good mouse. Being a Latin American child and watched him my whole life in Latin America as well as the United States, I don't recall ever having any negative connotations with him."" Lemus also noted that Speedy provided something of a role model for some of his less ambitious cartoon peers. ""Some of the other mice were not the best of all characters, but (Speedy) always chastised them for being lazy and he always told them to get your act together. I don't [think] he's so bad.""
