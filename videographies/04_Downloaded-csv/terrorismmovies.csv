"Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (Le Charme discret de la bourgeoisie) (1972)","Directed by Luis Buñuel. Cast: Fernando Rey, Delphine Seyrig, Stephane Audran, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Bulle Ogier, Paul Frankeur, Julien Bertheau. An all-star French cast assembles for an elegant dinner party, but whenever they try to eat, something happens to interrupt them. Mixes biting social satire with bold surrealistic invention as the dinner party serves to lampoon such targets as diplomats, wealthy socialites and even radical terrorists.
""Terrorism and bomb explosions accompany Luis Bunuel?s surrealist trilogy The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972), The Phantom of Liberty (1974) and That Obscure Object of Desire (1977). The title of the last of these does not only refer to the woman the hero has fallen in love with, but also in a wider sense to the terrorism that comes to the surface in various moral, social, cultural, economic, psychological, and political forms and which manifests itself most clearly in the inexplicable bomb outrages accompanying the hero in his sexual quest. As he strides down the street in the concluding scene arm-in-arm with his ?obscure object? seemingly convinced he has finally ?got? her, bombs go off everywhere: The final word in Bunuel?s last film on violence and desire?and terror???""
