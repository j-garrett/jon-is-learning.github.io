"The Tracker (Australia, 2002)","Directed by Rolf de Heer. Cast: David Gulpilil, Gary Sweet, Damon Gameau, Grant Page, Noel Wilton. Set in 1922 in the outback, the story follows three mounted policemen and an Aboriginal tracker on a mission to bring to justice a black man accused of murdering a white woman. The party's leader is a sadistic racist known simply as the Fanatic. Their guide, the Tracker, is a resourceful and complex character, who keeps everyone guessing until the end. They are constantly half a day behind the Fugitive. Frustrations spill over as the tension mounts. Relationships among the pursuers are put to the test, and alliances shift among the men. Brutal acts are repaid. Law and justice are explored. 95 min.
