Presenting instead a vision of the ""coexistence"" of difference, Said concludes with the fundamental challenge that faces humanity at the turn of the millennium. 55 min. 1998. ' vhs

As the shadow of the Dark Ages fell across Europe, the scene for the advancement of Western civilization shifted to the Near East. This program charts the rise of the Arab empire from its roots in the long-standing rivalry between the Byzantines and the Sassanids. Examines the dual role of Mecca as a place of worship and as a center for trade, the life of Muhammad and the birth of Islam, the rapid expansion of Arabia at the expense of Byzantium and the Sassanid kingdom, and the internecine struggle between Arab factions that led to the founding of the Umayyad dynasty. 26 min.

The victory of the Abbisids over the Umayyads signified much more than the replacement of one dynasty with another. With it, Islam saw the birth of a multiethnic concept of power, in which both Arab and non-Arab Muslims could share authority. This program presents the Abbasid Caliphate at its peak, enthroned in its prestigious capital city: Baghdad. The defining project of Caliph al-Ma'amun, the translation by an army of clerks of all the ancient writings his emissaries could procure is spotlighted--an achievement that set the stage for an eventual showdown between religious and secular scholars. 27 min.

This program captures what it was like to be a pilgrim in a caravan bound for Mecca, an official carrying out the Caliph's orders, a scholar seeking knowledge, a merchant in search of new markets, and an explorer charting the seas. Some of the era's most memorable personalities --mathematician al-Khuwarizmi, the chronicler Abul Hasan Ali al Mas'udi, the cartographer Abu al-Qasim Muhammad ibn Hawqal -- are profiled. 26 min.

This program scrutinizes the wonderfully audacious tale of Scheherezade and what it tells the attentive reader about the dreams of Arab men and women during the empire's golden age.

The rise of feudalism and papal authority, the gradual defeat of the Muslim rulers in Spain, the Seljuk ursurpation of Abbisid power in the Near East, and the Crudades are explained, along with the concerted efforts of Catholic authorities to translate the vast libraries of Arab scientific and philosophical texts. 26 min.

This program seeks to understand the religious climate of the late Middle Ages, in which universities and madrassas became centers of power and models for evolving sociopolitical systems. The potentially heretical nature of philosophy is also analyzed--in Islamic lands the djinni of intellectuality was put back in the bottle, but in Christendom it escaped the control of those who used it, paving the way for Renaissance humanism. 27 min.

"All Restrictions End","In the early days of the Iranian revolution, anyone with press lines on his trousers would be dismissed from work. How can one say his prayers to Allah without breaking his trousers' press lines?"" This and other reflections on Islam and clothing characterize this thought-provoking, free-form documentary. With clothing as the leitmotif, the filmmaker provides the history of Iran, the country of his birth, where beheadings and hangings are commonplace occurrences. It is an endless series of confrontations between groups that all want something different for their country. Clothing remains the point of departure in the stories about Iran, a land that has tottered for centuries between East and West, the present and the past, freedom and repression. In Baudelaire's words, fashion is the mirror of the times, and that makes it a great metaphor for what is going on in a country. The film is structured like a collage, interweaving archival footage from Iranian cinema, imagery from various stylistic epochs in the history of Persian painting, graphics from the period of the Islamic Revolution, and works provided by various artists.

"Shi'ism: Awaiting the Hidden Imam.","Adherents of Shi'ism comprise less that ten percent of the more than one billion Muslims in the world today, but ever since the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, with its indelible images of blindfolded hostages seized at the American Embassy in Tehran, Shi'ism has been perceived by most Westerners as a religious sect characterized by violence and fanaticism. The ouster of Saddam Hussein in 2003 and the continuing U.S. occupation of Iraq have led to a resurgence of Shia political activity after decades of oppression by Saddam's Sunni-dominated regime, providing Shi?ism with new found political influence as well as an opportunity to improve its image. This film discusses the history of Shi'ism, its origins, mythology of martyrdom, the centuries of persecution and discrimination of Shi'ism as a minority faith, and its basic tenets including the belief in the twelfth, or 'hidden' Imam, who will appear on the Last Day as the Mahdi. Filmed in Iran, Lebanon and Iraq, this film interweaves contemporary and historical footage, and introduces Muslim scholars, philosophers, writers, politicians and religious leaders discussing a wide range of issues. A film by Said Bakhtaoui and Mohammad Ballout. 2005. 53 min. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+1075"">Video/C 1075Ж","IranЖ"

The Assault on Freedom and Democracy: Chomsky ""moves from broad, geo-political concerns to the sort of authoritarian societies needed ""on the ground"" for such imperial strategies to work. Discussing the Patriot Acts (1 & 2) at home and a long and disgraceful U.S. history of ""democracy-building"" abroad, Chomsky highlights the vast difference between noble rhetoric and our consistent military and economic support for dictators and thugs.""

The interviews with Soldiers and Marines were conducted at the combat outposts where they lived and worked.

"[Aljafari, Kamal] The films of Kamal Aljafari","Contents: Port of memory (2009, 62 min.) -- The Roof (2006, 61 min.) -- Balconies (2009, 11 min.) -- Visit Iraq (2006, 26 min.). The haunting films of Kamal Aljafari mix documentary, fiction and personal memoir to render complex portraits of the Palestinian communities in Ramleh and Jaffa, now part of Israel. While providing a rare look at the everyday lives of Palestinian Israelis, the films are more than simply sociopolitical treatises of often-overlooked communities and neighborhoods in danger of dissolving. Aljafari instead astutely balances fiction and nonfiction to capture the fragile rhythms of lives lived in a kind of permanent displacement and the strange limbo of neighborhoods subtly yet inexorably transforming. Port of Memory : The history of the town of Jaffa, a thriving port city now part of Tel Aviv, provides the background for Aljafari's most recent film, centering on his mother's family at risk of eviction if they can't find proof that the house they have lived in for decades belongs to them. Their predicament is rendered with Aljafari's usual subtlety, as well as deadpan humor and dark wit. This skeletal narrative provides the scaffolding for a portrait of life in what was once a bustling neighborhood that was nearly emptied by fighting during the establishment of the state of Israel, and then suffered decades of official neglect. The Roof : This deceptively quiet film presents a portrait of Aljafari's family in Ramleh and Jaffa that hovers between documentary and cinematic memoir, guided by a nimble camera moving calmly but ceaselessly around the rooms of homes inhabited, damaged and ruined. The title refers to the roof missing from the house where Aljafari's family resettled in 1948, a home unfinished, an incomplete construction project. Balconies : An experimental meditation focusing on the deteriorating and unfinished balconies in Palestine. Visit Iraq : A humorous look at how Geneva residents imagine and project clichés on the recently abandoned office of Iraqi Airlines. 159 min.

On its 40th anniversary, the region remains trapped in conflict and is every bit as explosive as it was then. For Israel, the 1967 war was a military success. But it also redrew the map of the Middle East and mired the region in a never-ending cycle of occupation, terrorism and reprisal. The Six Day War forever changed the politics of the Middle East by helping to destroy the secular basis of Pan-Arab nationalism and transform secular Zionism. It gave rise to a Palestinian nationalist movement and helped unleash the fury of fundamentalism.

"The Moroccan Labyrinth (Laberinto Marroqui)","In 1898 Spain focused its colonial aims on northern Morocco, establishing a Spanish Protectorate in 1912. From 1920 to 1926, Spanish military attempts to conquer the territory were resisted by the guerrilla forces of Rif leader Abd el-Krim. The film reveals how this colonial conflict served as the prologue to the Spanish Civil War, with losses in the African war undermining the monarchy and politically emboldening the ""African militarists,"" including generals such as Francisco Franco, who in 1936 launched a revolt against the Spanish Republic. Ironically, in order to escape famine and poverty, thousands of Moroccans enlisted in the Spanish Falangist movement and found themselves fighting for their former enemies in Spain against Republican forces.

"The Pupil of Her Hand, In the Palm of Her Eye.","A film by Claire Dannenbaum. ""A visual exploration of an invisible phenomenon, The Pupil of Her Hand In the Palm of Her Eye maps the cross-cultural and personal journey of the filmmaker's search for an elusive subject, the evil eye. Using footage shot in Morocco, the film traces the irony of looking, gazing and glancing in Moroccan women's culture, where such actions are heavily coded and controlled. Ultimately, an evocation of references that lead to and hover about the evil eye, the film suggests the inherent complexity of ethnographic documents portraying another culture.""
