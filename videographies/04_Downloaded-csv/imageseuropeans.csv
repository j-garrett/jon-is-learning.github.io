""Frank Taylor is an average hard-working Joe in a machine shop with ambitions to become foreman. When the job opens, it is given to Joe Dombrowski, a Polish-American immigrant who spends his free time reading technical books on the workings of a drill press rather than socializing with other workers. Frank becomes disgruntled and is easily recruited by a co-worker to join the Black Legion, a secretive hate group similar to the Ku Klux Klan, which appeals to the xenophobic fears of its members and uses violence to intimidate foreign-born Americans. When Frank and other black-hooded Legionaires burn out Dombrowski's chicken farm, the frightened family leaves town, opening up the foreman's job again. When Legion business begins to occupy more and more of Frank's time and energy both in the factory and at night, it soon costs him his job and ultimately his marriage as it leads him toward tragedy.""

"25th Hour (2002)","Directed by Spike Lee. Cast:Edward Norton, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Barry Pepper, Rosario Dawson, Anna Paquin, Brian Cox. ""This is the story of a poor Irish kid from New York City who once wanted to be a fireman, but ended up instead, a drug dealer. He explains his situation this way. The most important thing in life is 'sway,' that is, the influence you have over your surroundings. He has charm, good looks and, as a dealer, money. It was the easiest and fastest way to get to the top – until he got caught. He is the charmer. His father is the dreamer. The father, an alcoholic saloonkeeper, never could make ends meet. He sees himself as the classic ner-do-well Irish father, blaming himself for his son's choices in life. Yet, even with grim reality loaming overhead, he talks of changing his son's situation, carrying on expansively about his son's rosy future."" Based on the book by David Benioff.

"Million Dollar Baby (2004)","Directed by Clint Eastwood. Cast: Clint Eastwood, Hillary Swank, Morgan Freeman, Anthony Mackie. ""Here we have two Irish-American characters who at first look to have little in common except their love of boxing. Dunn, the manager, spends his time reading the great Irish writers, badgering the local Catholic priest with questions and learning Gaelic. Fitzgerald spends her time working and training, oblivious to her roots. But their connection is made clear when he gives her a Kelly-green robe with 'Mo Cuishle' on the back the day she fights the British champion. He won't tell her what the words mean, but all who know the history will get the not-too-subtle metaphor. Fans have chosen many boxers as their champion, representing a race, nationality, or more broadly, the underdog. Fitzgerald, by being the odds-on-favorite, became the darling of all who identified with her. Now they can say ""if she can do it maybe I can.""""

"The Molly Maguires (1970)","Directed by Martin Ritt. Cast: Richard Harris, Sean Connery, Samantha Eggar, Frank Finlay, Anthony Zerbe, Bethel Leslie, Art Lund. The Molly Maguires was a secret society of militant coal miners who battled their exploitation by mine owners with violence, intimidation, and sometimes murder. Based on actual events, this gripping story is a sympathetic and accurate account of the Irish-American miners' struggle. Richard Harris plays a detective on undercover assignment for the owners, fighting to win the workers' trust, and finally, fighting his own conscience. Sean Connery is the tough and suspicious leader of the Mollies who repeatedly tests the newcomer's loyalty. 123 min. ; ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eDVD+8445"">DVD 8445Ж, Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/evhs+999:2353"">vhs 999:2353Ж","â€¢149;Ѭ href=""http://us.imdb.com/Title?0066090"">Credits and other information from the Internet Movie DatabaseЖ

"Mystic River(2003)","Directed by Clint Eastwood. Cast: Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney, Kevin Chapman, Adam Nelson, Tom Guiry. Based on the novel by Dennis Lehane. ""The underpinning of this story is a familiar one: in the tough ghetto, one kid grows up to be a cop, the other a gangster. But this film is far more detailed, realistic, and disturbing than the Hell's Kitchen flicks of Hollywood's golden age. When children grow up in a neighborhood where crime is an accepted part of life, they are set up from the get-go, with an edge. When a crime is committed in the neighborhood, a complex set of loyalties must be adhered to. The police, left out of the loop, are of little use; then the locals are free to seek vengeance. The cop here, aided by his insider knowledge of the turf, is shown as very competent. And, like his counterparts from the old gangster films, he has an understanding of those who chose the other side of the law.""

Powers tries to avenge Doyle's death but his efforts lead to a chilling and savage conclusion.

"Marx Brothers","Including, of course, Chico's inimitably, over-the-top characature of a characature of an Italian. The Marx Brothers particularly anarchic comedy, with its elements of vaudeville and Yiddish theater schtick, can be read as a goofy metaphor for the ""messy"" entry of early century immigrants into established American culture.

Mean Streets(1973)
Directed by Martin Scorsese; starring Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, David Proval, Amy Robinson, Richard Romanus. ""The future is set for Tony and Michael - owning a neighbour- hood bar and making deals in the mean streets of New York city's Little Italy. For Charlie, the future is less clearly defined. A small-time hood, he works for his uncle, making collections and reclaiming bad debts. He's probably too nice to succeed. In love with a woman his uncle disapproves of (because of her epilepsy) and a friend of her cousin, Johnny Boy, a near psychotic whose trouble-making threatens them all - he can't reconcile opposing values. A failed attempt to escape (to Brooklyn) moves them all a step closer to a bitter, almost preordained future."" (from the Internet Movie Database) 112 min.
