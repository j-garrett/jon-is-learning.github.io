Even more alarming is the wide-spread use of children as fodder for prostitution rings around the world. This program profiles a Moroccan-born former house slave named Rania, whose father, believing she would be educated and cared for, allowed her to be taken to France at the age of eight. Viewers also meet Sino and La Thiya, Cambodian victims of Southeast Asia's rampant child sex industry.

Disease warriors: Chronicles the groundbreaking work of early researchers, such as Louis Pasteur, who unmasked germs as the source of illness. Today, vaccines have made huge strides against epidemics, conquering smallpox and bringing global eradication of polio within reach. But the world still faces major challenges in getting basic vaccines to those who still need them, and in creating new ones to combat modern nemeses, like AIDS. Rise of the superbugs: Looks at the discovery of the first antibiotic, penicillin and the subsequent development of more ""wonder drugs."" Also looks at the growing threat posed by new strains of germs, such as tuberculosis and staph, that are resistant to our best antibiotics.","â€¢149;Delivering the Goods; Deadly Messengers.
Delivering the Goods: At the dawn of the 21st century, we can prevent, treat or cure most of the deadliest diseases--and yet millions die needlessly every year because the benefits of modern medicine and public health fail to reach them. What are the obstacles to providing care to populations in need? This program profiles innovative health programs in Third World Countries, and the leaders who, against all odds, are ""delivering the goods."" Deadly messengers: Since the plague of the Middle Ages, vector-borne diseases -- those that rely on insects and animals to spread infectious agents -- have posed a serious threat to public health. Today, the most dangerous vector on earth is the mosquito. From malaria to yellow fever to West Nile virus, mosquito-borne diseases continue to threaten the health of millions around the world.","â€¢149;Back to the Basics; How Safe Are We?
Back to the Basics: Nutrient-enriched products have reduced diseases caused by vitamin deficiency, but poorer countries also suffer from the twin problems of poor nutrition and unsafe water. This segment explores the connection between health and the essential requirements that so many people take for granted. It also examines how an overabundance of food -- in the form of over-consumption -- is causing an epidemic of obesity that is spreading across the globe. How Safe Are We? Despite the rise in life expectancy in the past 100 years, in the last few decades, thirty new infectious diseases have emerged and one of them -- AIDS -- is becoming perhaps the most devastating epidemic in history. New diseases travel the globe with unprecedented rapidity. This segment examines the most critical threats we face today -- including avian flu -- and the pressing need to strengthen global public health systems.

Native American remains and human rights: Despite the passage of NAGPRA Native Americans are still being confronted by scientists claiming a right to own or control dead Indian bodies in order to conduct experiments on them perpetuating a double standard which began with early North American exploration that treated Indian bodies as property, curios or archaeological artifacts while dead bodies and gravesof other citizens were protected by laws.
Human remains and NAGPRA: The chief archaeologist of the National Park Service explains the procedures and requirements of NAGPRA that requires the repatriation of Native American human remains and other cultural objects in public museum collections and those recovered from federal lands.
Bone courts and Native American sovereignty: Considers aproposal to establish a Bone Court -- a new federal judicial forum to hear and decide disputes over museum collections of human remains, repatriation, burial sites, research on bones and to protect native sovereignty. 180 min.

Kennewick Man: setting limits to NAGPRA / James C. Chatters -- History and repatriation of Ishi/ Orin Starn -- From performance to record: Ishi's music and speech / Irfa Jhacknis -- The humanity of Ishi / Karl Kroeber.
Panel: Joseph Myers (Introductions), William Johnson(Moderator), James C. Chatters, Orin Starn, Ira Jacknis, Karl Kroeber, Karen Biestman (Discussant).
Kennewick Man: NAGPRA was intended to return the remains of recent Native American dead to their nearest of kin but was not intended to hand over ancient human ossils to modern-day Indian tribes, yet that is howit is being interpreted by some. Much of the scientific community and American public feels ancient remains, which often cannot be linked to modern tribes, should not be summarily reburied for temporal political reasons. This talk addresses this conflict which came to a head with the case of the Kennewick Man, a ca. 9,500 year old skeleton.
History and repatriation of Ishi: A small group from thePit River Tribe held a private ceremony last month to rebury Ishi, the last Yahi Indian. This paper offers one view of the campaign to repatriate Ishi and what it can tell us about anthropology, Native America, andthe politics of memory and identity.
From performance to record: Ishi's music and speech: Between 1911 to 1914, T. T. Waterman and Alfred Kroeber recorded Ishi, his music and narration of stories. This talk examines the preservation of these recordings and their content.
Humanity of Ishi: Historical evaluation of Ishi'sbehavior challenges judgments that reduce his role tothat of passive victim. Such reduction in fact is aninverse expression of the cliche of the ""noble savage,"" and diminishes understanding of and respect for theunique individuality of Ishi's impressiveness as ahuman being. 153 min.

Panel: Nancy Scheper-Hughes (Introduction), Ruth Richardson, Margaret Lock, Lesley Sharp, Alan Shewmon, Laura Nader (Discussant).
Corpses for dissection, organs for transplant: Considers the current world organ shortage in a long historical perspective and compares the procurement histories oforgans for transplant and corpses for dissection drawing disquieting parallels between them.
On being good-as-dead in a world short of organs: Examines the concept of brain death and its viability as a diagnostic tool of ""death,"" since new medical technologies have kept bodies ""alive"" for more than ayear after brain death has occurred. Increasing world-wide demand for organs for transplant and thedebate about giving legal recognition to ""social death,"" highlights the urgency to clarify the way in which medical and bioethical professionals define death.
Who owns the donor body?: In the past donor's identities have been anonymous but recently donor kin have asserted their rights to proclaim publicly the personal identities of organ donors through new memorial forms that circumvent professional involvement. This talk explores the conflicts that arise as lay versus professional parties assert competing claims upon the donor body and its parts and the means by which the former now circumvent the obstructionist strategies of the latter.
The Brain and human death: Widespread confusion surrounds both the precise signification of ""brain death,"" and the rationale for its purported equivalence with death. Here a neurologist reconsiders whether ""brain death"" is any longer conceptually viable or even pragmatically necessary. 184 min.

Panel: Guy Micco (moderator), Lawrence Cohen, Michael M.Friedlaender, Nancy Scheper-Hughes, Rosemary Thandiwe Sitsheshe, Linda Johnson, Lilian Goffi.
Medical triangle: Reviews the history and sociology of organ procurement and transplantation in India focusing on the origins of the market in kidneys, the emergence of marked regions of kidney sales, the role of private hospitals and their funding, of politicians and bureaucrats and foreign agents of various sorts.
Right to sell a kidney: A kidney transplant clinic in Jerusalem has been treating Arab and Israeli patients returning after buying kidneys abroad. These transplants, which are illegal in Israel, are discussed making a strong case for both the legalization of remuneration for kidney donation and also for strengthening the restraints on illegal transactions.
Body and commodity fetishism: The global traffic inhuman organs, tissues and body parts -- from the living as well as from the dead -- is examined as an anthropological analysis of postmodern forms of human sacrifice disguised as a ""donation,"" rendered invisible by its anonymity, and hidden under the medical rhetoric of ""life saving"" and ""gift giving."".
Human rights violations at the Cape Town police mortuary: A loophole in the South African Organ and Tissue Act has allowed some doctors to harvest tissues and organs without considering feelings of the next of kin, justifying their actions as motivated by the altruistic desire to ""save lives."".
Personal accounts of organs and tissue theft: Recounts the experiences of an American wife who donated her husband's organs upon physician's request to discover later that they have been sold by ""body brokers"" in Germany.
Kidney theft in a modern private hospital: Recounts the theft of a kidney from a living patient in Argentina which occurred while she was being operated on for another medical condition. 184 min.

The definition has changed, as evidenced in Ireland, the Balkans, and the former Soviet Union, where factions within nations vie for supremacy. Explores the difficulties that this new reality presents for U.S. peacekeeping operations. 1998. 29 min.

"The Yes Men","A comedic documentary which follows The Yes Men, a small group of prankster activists, as they gain world-wide notoriety for impersonating the World Trade Organization on television and at business conferences around the world. The film begins when two members of The Yes Men, Andy and Mike, set up a website that mimics the World Trade Organization's --and it's mistaken for the real thing.
