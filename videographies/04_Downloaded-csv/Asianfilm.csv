"Shanghai Dreams (Qing hong) (China, 2005)","Directed by Xiaoshuai Wang. Cast: Gao Yuanyuan, Li Bin, Yan Anlian, Tang Yang. In the mid-1960s the Chinese government, fearing conflict with the Soviet Union, called for strategically important factories to be moved inland to form a 'Third Line of Defense'. Answering their country's call, innumerable workers and their families left their homes in such large cities as Shanghai and Beijing and followed the factories to the barren terrain of western China. Set twenty years later, as the country begins to reform and open up to the rest of the world, Wang Xiaoshuai's moving film tells the poignant tale of one such displaced family and the conflict that arises when 19 year-old Qinghong finds love for the first time with a local boy, much to the disapproval of her father who dreams of returning his family to Shanghai. 115 min.

Sometime in the near future, near anarchy has broken out in Japan.

If more than one is still alive after three days, every survivor will be killed. The film follows a class of 14-year-olds who believe they're on a school trip, when they are drugged. They wake up, in a derelict building on a deserted island; they're each given enough provisions for three days, a weapon, and the ultimatum. Based on a novel by Takami Koshun.

"Sopyonje (1993)","Directed by Kwon-taek Im. The specifically Korean tradition that is reclaimed in Sopyonje is the type of folk-song known as p?ansori, described as a musical sublimation of southwest Korea's collective grief and suffering - in other words, a kind of blues. The film's three central characters are itinerant p?ansori singers in the 1950s, a time when many aspects of Korean culture came under siege from Japanese and western influences. A man named Dong-ho is roaming the rural hinterlands, ostensibly to find rare herbal medicines for his sick son back in Seoul, but actually in search of Song-hwa, the woman he grew up with. Orphans, they were both apprenticed to the p?ansori master Yu-bong who pressured them to sacrifice everything for the art. Dong-ho rebelled and ran away, but Song-hwa stayed, lost her sight, and outlived Yu-bong. Rumor has it that she is still travelling and still singing p?ansori... 113 min.
