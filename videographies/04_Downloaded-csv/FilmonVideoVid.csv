"Valentino's Ghost","Valentino's Ghost takes viewers on a chronological journey through more than a century of images of Muslims, Arabs and Islam in the U.S. media, from the early 20th-century fantasies of romantic sheiks to today's damaging stereotypes as evil fanatics. The film shows the way in which the changing image of Arabs and Muslims has mirrored America's political agenda in the Middle East. Valentino's Ghost enables viewers to put stereotypical representations of muslims and Arabs in historical context to sharpen their media literacy and increase their skills in questioning media representations, especially those of minority groups and people with whom our government is in conflict. The film ends with a report of a few Hollywood films that have provided complex images and avoided ethnic stereotyping. Written and directed by Michael Singh. Extras include ""22 minutes of extended interviews with Robert Fisk, Niall Ferguson, John Mearsheimer, Melani McAlister, Alan Sharp plus 5 clips [2:32] from comics Aron Kader and Maz Jobrani."" 93 min.

"Unwanted Cinema (Unerwunschtes Kino)","For many Jewish filmmakers, actors, actresses, writers, directors and other creative talents, the rise of Hitler and the Nazi party first threatened their livelihoods and soon their lives. In 1934 the exclusion of Jewish filmmakers in Germany led to independent productions in Budapest and Vienna, the so-called ""Unwanted Cinema"" banned by the Nazis. This documentary profiles a number of Jewish artists who contributed to independent films produced in Vienna and Budapest between 1934 and 1937. The film follows them in subsequent years, as they sought refuge from the Nazi terror, both in Europe and the U.S. The film focuses on Henry Koster, Ernst Verebes, Otto Wallburg, Felix Joachimson (Jackson), Hans Jaray, Franziska Gaal, Rosy Barsony, Hortense Raky, Oskar Pilzer, and Zoltan Vidor. Featuring scenes from many films of the period, Unwanted Cinema also recounts the efforts of Hollywood producer Joseph Pasternak, who offered many of these men and women their best chance of survival.
