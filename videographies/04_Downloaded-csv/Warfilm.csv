""The Fighting 69th"" is based on a World War I regiment consisting mostly of New York-Irish soldiers. Jerry Plunkett is the cockiest member of a cocky crew, a scrappy fellow who looks out only for himself. The officers and enlisted of the regiment do their best to instill discipline in Plunkett, and the chaplain, Father Duffy, tries to make Plunkett see the greater good. None of them seem to succeed. In the trenches, Plunkett acts selfishly and cowardly, eventually costing the lives of many of his fellow soldiers. A final act of cowardice leads to terrible consequences, but Plunkett sees in them a chance to redeem himself.

Interviews: Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., King Vidor, Lillian Gish, Blanche Sweet. The outbreak of World War I provided Hollywood with one of its greatest sources of plots - and profits. As the American mood shifted away from neutrality, Hollywood followed, abandoning films with pacifist themes for stories of war at the front. With the arrival of peace, war films vanished until King Vidor made The Pig Parade in 1925, followed by What Price Glory and All Quiet on the Western Front. 52 min.

"J'Accuse. (France, 1938)","Directed by Abel Gance. Cast: Victor Francen, Jean-Max, Renee Devillers, Marie Lou. J'Accuse was first released in 1919 as a silent film, but during the late thirties, appalled at the prospect of a second World War, Gance retold his story in a vastly different version to challenge the awful onslaught of history. Jean Diaz is a research scientist who survived the carnage of WWI and swears to dedicate his life to ending war, a burden which drives him to madness. When he discovers his work is being exploited by the military-industrial establishment, he summons up the millions of dead soldiers from World War I to rise from their graves, to bring the world to its senses. Gance's monumental work anticipated the terrible destructive capability of modern weapons and remains a powerful statement for today. 125 min. ; ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/evhs+999:2109"">vhs 999:2109Ж, Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/evhs+999:2384"">vhs 999:2384Ж","â€¢149;Ѭ href=""http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0031503/"">Credits and other information from the Internet Movie DatabaseЖ","Ѭ href=""http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/frenchbib.html#accuse"">See separate bibliography of reviews and articles about this filmЖ","World War IЖ"

Angela tends a lighthouse in an Italian fishing village while her brothers are fighting at the front. She discovers a foreign sailor washed ashore, nurses him back to health and falls in love with him. After they marry and have a baby, she discovers that he is a German spy and that her innocent actions have helped cause the death of her brother. Considered to be one of Pickford's most fully realized adult characters, the film shows her astonishing range: from pure slapstick, to moments of pathos, to a harrowing descent into madness. 75 min. ; ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eDVD+X1998"">DVD X1998Ж, Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/evhs+999:2636"">vhs 999:2636Ж","â€¢149; Ѭ href=""http://us.imdb.com/Title?0012408"">Credits and other information from the Internet Movie DatabaseЖ","World War IЖ"

"Three Comrades (1938)","Director, Frank Borzage. Screenplay, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Edward A. Paramore. Cast: Margaret Sullavan, Robert Taylor, Robert Young, Franchot Tone, Guy Kibbee. A poignant love story centered around the lives of three young, disillusioned returned soldiers caught up in the turmoil of post World War I Germany. Their close friendship is strengthened by their shared love for the same woman who is dying of tuberculosis. Careful self-censorship by the producer lessened the film's impact as an indictment of Nazi Germany, yet despite the Hollywood makeover of Remarque's novel the film still conveys the haunting sense of hopelessness and waste felt by a generation of youth indelibly marked by the war and its consequences.

"World War II Films: GermanЖ","08/15 (Null-acht funfzehn) (1954)","Director, Paul May. This finely crafted look into life in a German military barracks shortly before WWII is the story of a rebellious young trainee who launches a mutiny against his superiors. Although the film focuses primarily on the tribulations of the new recruit it also presents a fascinating look at the lives of other soldiers, officers and civilians (most of whom are played by non-professional actors). The film's title refers to a particular type of German machine gun (Maschinengewehr) produced in 1915. (The term 'Null-acht-fünfzehn' lives on as an idiom in the German langauge--'08/15' ('Null-acht-funfzehn') being used like an adjective to denote something 'standardized' and unremarkable).

"Jarhead (2005)","Directed by Sam Mendes. Cast: Jake Gyllenhaal, Scott MacDonald, Peter Sarsgaard, Jamie Foxx, Jacob Vargas, Lucas Black, Brian Geraghty, Evan Jones, Chris Cooper. Follows ""Swoff,"" a third-generation Marine enlistee, from a sobering stint in boot camp to active duty, sporting a sniper's rifle and a hundred-pound ruck on his back through the Middle East deserts. There is no cover from intolerable heat or from the Iraqi soldiers, who are always potentially just over the next horizon. Swoff and his fellow Marines sustain themselves with sardonic humanity and wicked comedy on blazing desert fields in a country they don't understand, against an enemy they can't see, for a cause they don't fully understand. Sergeant Sykes, a Marine lifer, heads up the scout/sniper platoon, while Troy, Swoff's friend and mentor, is a die-hard member of STA - the elite Marine Unit. 123 min.

"Before the Rain (A Tale in Three Parts) (Republic of Macedonia | France | UK, 1994)","Director, Milcho Manchevski. Cast: Rade Serbedzija, Katrin Cartlidge, Labina Mitevska, Gregoire Colin. The first film made in the newly independent Republic of Macedonia, Milcho Manchevski's Before the Rain crosscuts the stories of an orthodox Christian monk , a British photo agent and a native Macedonian war photographer to paint a portrait of simmering ethnic and religious hatred about to reach its boiling point. Made during the strife of the war-torn Balkan states in the nineties, this gripping triptych of love and violence is also a timeless evocation of the loss of pastoral innocence, and remains one of recent cinema's most powerful laments on the futility of war.

He fires on them, killing one, and taking the second hostage. Now both are alone and equally armed, so they are forced to share a wary trust as they try to attract help from either side. 114 min.

On a seemingly average day, a busload of young soldiers is sent to a remote location in the countryside and given a macabre task: the execution of a number of civilians. Dzoni, a green recruit, initially objects, but as he moves from one killing to the next, he is swept up by the spectre of military authority, and quickly becomes desensitized by the apparently routine nature of his task. As he nears the end of his assignment, the quiet horror of the day slowly begins to affect him, forcing a painful reconciliation with his actions. Set in an unspecified time of conflict in the Balkans, the film captures the psychological toll of war on its participants, and the universal struggle of all soldiers to reconcile morality with action. 79 min.
