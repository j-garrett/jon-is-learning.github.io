In the early 1960s, hundreds of Kentucky coal miners are displaced by machines and strike out at their former employers. Millions of others displaced by machines across Appalachia and the rural South head north to begin a new life in Chicago, where they face overcrowded tenements and schools, and the familiar inequities of segregation.

Indeed, as all the panelists note, in its largest sense the southern struggle was not just for Black-only freedom. Three ""White"" organizations were of particular importance to SNCC: The Highlander Center founded in the 1930s to begin addressing the needs of poor Appalachian Whites embraced the civil rights struggle providing one of the few southern sites for integrated discussion and planning; the Southern Conference Educational Fund (SCEF) which reflected a White southern radical organizing tradition and was one of SNCC's earliest supporters; and finally, the Southern Student Organizing Committee (SSOC), young White southerners who took seriously SNCC's call for Whites to organize White communities. The panel discusses the work of all these organizations as well as the remarkable success of the Washington, DC-based Jews for Urban Justice organization which also developed in response to SNCC's work.

"Berkeley in the Sixties.","A film by Mark Kitechell. Contents: Pt. 1 Confronting the university: the Free Speech Movement-- pt. 2. Confronting America: the anti-war movement (32 min.) -- pt. 3. Confronting history: the counter-culture movement(45 min.). Through interviews with participants and archival footage, presents a history of Berkeley, California in the 1960s. This film is a celebration and tribute to the spirited rebellion of the students of Berkeley in the 1960s. It romanticizes the past in some ways, but the participants, many of them just as dedicated to causes as they were as youths at Berkeley offer realistic and honest remembrances from those hectic days. The film is in three distinct segments: Part I -- Confronting the University. The demonstrations began simply with students protesting the appearance of the House Un-American Activities Committee on campus to investigate communist appearances as speakers. It was the beginning of Speaker Ban. It tells of the creation of the student activist group known as SLATE, and the increasing confrontations with the University administration then led by W. Clark Kerr. 41 minutes. Part II -- Confronting America. Largely about the efforts to carry their activism beyond the campus and the narrow environment of Berkeley and Oakland. The issues of Civil Rights and Free Speech soon give way to protest against the war in a place called Vietnam. 31 minutes. Part III -- Confronting History. The emergence of the counter-culture in neighboring San Francisco, and the politicization of blacks as represented by Stokeley Carmichael and more especially the activities of Huey Newton and Bobby Seale and the Black Panthers creates a new environment for many of the people in this movement. Suddenly differences in perspective and scope of activism change. 44 minutes. Notes: Edited by Veronica Selves. Photographed by Stephen Lighthill. Narrated by Susan Griffin. Written by Griffin, Kitchell, and Stephen Most. Among those interviewed are: Frank Bardacke, Jentri Anders, John Gage, Jack Weinberg, Michael Rossman, Bobby Seale, David Hilliard, Ruth Rosen, Suzy Nelson, Barry Melton, John Searle, Mike Miller, Hardy Fry and Susan Griffin. Songs heard on the track include They All Sang Bread And Roses, Fortunate Son (Creedence Clearwater Revival), The Weight (The Band) The Revolution Will Not Be Televised (Gil Scott Heron) and The Jefferson Airplane's Embryonic Journey. 1990. 117 min.

"[Hampton, Fred] The Murder of Fred Hampton","Mike Gray started out to make a film about the Black Panther Party, but on Dec. 4, 1969, the Chicago police raided a Panther apartment and his film became a documentary about the murder of Fred Hampton, chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party. The film footage of the raid directly contradicted the State Attorney's version of the raid and so filmmakers and Panthers came together to prove that Hampton had been the designated target of the violent, punitive raid. The film's inquiry pursues official spokesmen and traps them in their attempts at covering up an orchestrated assassination. Originally produced in 1971. 88 min.

"Two Towns of Jasper","In 1998 in Jasper, Texas, James Byrd, Jr., a black man, was chained to a pickup truck and dragged to his death by three white men. The town was forever altered, and the nation woke up to the horror of a modern-day lynching. The filmmakers set out to document the aftermath of the murder by following the trials of the local men charged with the crime. The result is an explicit and troubling portrait of race in America, one that asks how and why a crime like this could have occurred. Originally produced in 2002 as a segment of the television series POV. Dist.: Ѭ href=""http://www.shoppbs.org"">PBS.Ж 83 min.

"Watts, Riot or Revolt? (CBS Reports)","Were the Watts riots part of a social revolution, a festering illness or a carnival of senseless violence? And why did it first erupt in L.A. and not in another major American city? This news program, filmed just a few months after the riots, presents a study of the principal events that ignited the conflagration in the summer of 1965 in Watts. A wide variety of individuals comment on the situtation, including L.A. chief of police William H. Parker, Daniel P. Moynihan, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., witnesses to the riots and rioters themselves. Originally aired on the CBS Television Network on December 7, 1965.
