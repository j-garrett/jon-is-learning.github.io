"The Global Banquet: By Invitation Only","A two part discussion of corporate farming and its global effects. Part 1 examines how corporate globalization of food threatens the livelihoods of small farmers in the U.S. and developing countries and how free trade is the route to mounting hunger worldwide, despite an overabundance of food.

"Good Food","In the Pacific Northwest small family farmers are making a comeback. They're growing much healthier food, and lots more food per acre, while using less energy and water than factory farms. For decades Northwest agriculture was focused on a few big crops for export. But to respond to climate change and the end of cheap energy, each region needs to produce more of its own food and to grow food more sustainably. The film visits producers, farmers' markets, distributors, stores, restaurants and public officials who are developing a more sustainable food system for all. Written and directed by Melissa Young, Mark Dworkin. c2008. 73 min. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eDVD+X810"">DVD X810Ж","Food: Production, Consumption, Politics"

"Good Food/Bad Food: Obesity in American Children","Since the mid-1970s, there has been a tripling of the number of children who are overweight or at risk for being overweight. This film discusses some of the reasons for this phenomenon--there is little physical exercise, and there is poor food choice for children due to things such as the ease of fast food, TV advertisements, and vending machines and poor food lunches in schools. The result of this rise in obesity among children is an accompanying rise in physical problems associated with obesity formerly seen in adults, such as heart disease, type II diabetes, and sleep apnea. The film closes by showing a variety of activities and programs that can fight obesity in children. School lunches can be made more healthy and children can be made more involved with their food (such as growing a garden), physical education programs can be (re)instituted into the curriculum, and family-centered activities can be developed.

"The Omnivore's Dilemma","Knight Professor of Journalism Michael Pollan, discusses his new book, ""The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals,"" with Davia Nelson of NPR's The Kitchen Sisters and co-author of ""Hidden Kitchens: Stories, Recipes & More"". What should we have for dinner? According to Michael Pollan the answer may determine our survival as a species. Should we eat a fast-food hamburger? Something organic? Or perhaps something we hunt, gather, or grow ourselves? The omnivore's dilemma has returned with a vengeance, as the cornucopia of the modern American supermarket and fast-food outlet confronts us with a bewildering and treacherous food landscape. What's at stake in our eating choices is not only our own and our children's health, but the health of the environment that sustains life on earth.

"Our Daily Poison","According to the World Health Organization, the incidence of cancer has doubled over the last thirty years. Over this period, the increase in leukemia and brain tumours in children has been around 2% per year. The WHO has observed a similar trend for neurological diseases (Parkinson's and Alzheimer's) and autoimmune disorders. This documentary launches an in-depth investigation into everyday products and the systems charged with regulating them, examining the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) archives. Seeking answers the filmmaker manages to talk her way into secret meetings, and meets with regulators and respected renegade researchers throughout North American and Europe. The film shows that the main cause of the epidemic is environmental: the result of the 100,000 chemical molecules that have invaded our environment, and primarily our food, since the end of the Second World War.

Examines the impact of changes in traditional farming methods on the economy of Sudan. When the Sudan was a colony of Great Britain, the best farm land was used to grow cotton but a drop in cotton prices in the 1970's dictated a return to traditional food crops, which made the Sudan self-sufficient in food. Then the International Monetary Fund insisted that the nation return to growing cotton as a condition for making loans to the Sudan. Cotton prices remained low and the nation was forced to import grain from the U.S.--thus pushing the Sudan deeper into debt while the people starved.

"The Weight of the World: Facing Obesity","Its been called the world's first man-made epidemic, and its killing us. Dr. Stephan Rossner of Stockholm, an expert on obesity, leads us through startling evidence of how our society has created this toxic environment. Cheaper production, ""supersized"" fast foods and a $12 billion advertising industry are lethal when mixed with a car-dominated culture, urban sprawl and labour-saving technologies. Although North America is the epicentre of obesity, this disease is being exported worldwide as a by-product of western culture. Infiltrating low-income communities and developing nations, obesity is creating a potentially bankrupt health system. Directed and written by Glynis Whiting.
