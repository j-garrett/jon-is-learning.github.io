"Wheel of Time.","Wheel of Time is acclaimed filmmaker Werner Herzog's gorgeously photographed look at the largest Buddhist ritual in Bodh Gaya, India. It is said that Buddha found enlightenment under a tree in Bodh Gaya and today, Buddhist monks are ordained in this holy place. Herzog magically captures the lengthy pilgrimage (which for some, is over 3,000 miles), the monk's creation of the beautiful and intricate sand mandala (the wheel of time) along with many secret rituals that have never been seen before on film. He delivers a personal and introspective look at what Buddhism really means to the most ardent followers, as well as giving outsiders an intimate look into a fascinating way of life. 2003. 80 min.

It allowed the Protestant faith to burst its boundaries from its homeland in Europe. In America, it has become associated with conservative politics and its preachers have marketed Christianity with all the flair and swashbuckling enterprise of American commerce.

Despite the attacks of Newton, Voltaire, the French Revolutionaries and Darwin, Christianity has shown a remarkable resilience. The greatest damage to Christianity in fact was inflicted to its moral credibility by the two great wars of the 20th century and by its entanglement with Fascism and Nazism. And yet it is in crisis that the Church has rediscovered deep and enduring truths about itself.

Seizing the pro-family agenda, New Right conservative strategists midwife a brood of new Christian political organizations, most notably Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority. These groups experience a heady overnight success, registering millions of evangelical voters and helping sweep Ronald Reagan into office.

The fruit of their efforts, the Christian Coalition, is now one of most politically adept membership organizations ever. Yet many inside the movement question if, in gaining power in the secular world, conservative Christians have lost their evangelical soul.

Rincon is the site of a Roman Catholic Church dedicated to God in the name of San Lazaro (Saint Lazarus of Bethany). Local identification of the name Lazarus (Lazaro) with the beggar character from a parable in the New Testament and the similarity between that character and the image of the Yoruban deity Babalu-Aye, have blended to create a local deity. The shrine at Rincon is considered by the followers of San Lazaro/Babalu-Aye to be the house of their deity, a situation which causes difficulty for the Roman Catholic community present there. Film shows documentary footage of some of the practices associated with this cult and reveals some of the social problems which seem to fuel the desperation of these acts. 1995. 26 min.
