"DJ QBert's Wave Twisters","Plot: A crew of heroes, cleverly disguised as a team of oral hygenists, is determined to save the lost arts of Hip Hop (B-boying, Graffiti, MCing, and of course, Skratching) from total extinction. The lost arts are being oppressed throughout inner-space by lord Ook and his evil minions the Chinheads. The dental commander and his team, armed with the ancient relic known as the Wave Twister (the only weapon powerful enough to defeat the enemies), travel to the far ends of inner-space for a final confrontation with the sinister army of oppressors. Technique: An animated adventure cartoon synched scratch for scratch with DJ QBert's turntable masterpiece of the same title. This movie gives visual expression to QBert's narrative while pioneering the concept of visual scratching, sampling from a wide variety of techniques (from traditional cell animation to 3D to live action to photo collage), and defining a unique visual style analogous to the supercharged cutting and scratching of a turntable DJ. Special features: Commentary track with creators; Film-to-animatic comparisons; Behind-the-scenes featurette; Theatrical trailers for ""Wave Twisters"" and ""Scratch""; Two clips featuring five-angle footage of Qbert, D-styles, Flare, and Yoga Frog; Sketch book and animation tests. 120 min.

"Duke is Tops (1938)","Directed by William L. Nolte. ""Duke Davis (Ralph Cooper) has invested all his savings to back his sweetheart, Ethel (Lena Horne), in a road show over the old T.O.B.A. circuit, on which they have both been performers since childhood. Marshall (Monte Hawley), a New York talent scout, makes an offer to Ethel as a single and, to induce her to take it, Duke writes a fake check, made out to him, for $5000 pretending he has sold his contract with Ethel to Marshall. Resentful and heartbroken, she accepts and becomes a big hit in New York. Marshall then books her at the swanky Century Club, plans her show himself, and it flops miserably. Meanwhile, Duke has used his last resources to start a new show, but without Ethel it also fails. He joins the Doc Dorando (Lawrence Criner) medicine show, and with him as the speiler for the quack elixir sold by Dorando, it is successful. He becomes Doc's partner with an elaborate trailer and a company of entertainers, including Willie Covans, the Basin Street Boys, The Cats and the Fiddle, ""Rubberneck"" Holmes and Joe Stevenson. Money is rolling in but he drops everything to hurry to Ethel's side when he hears of her misfortune. Ella (Neva Peoples), Ethel's faithful companion and maid, has also told Ethel of Duke's sacrifice in order to give her a chance in New York. Duke talks the Century Club owner, Fenton (Edward Thompson),into allowing him to build an elaborate show based on a medicine show concept, and sends for Doc Dorando and the other entertainers.""

"Aria (1987)","Ten directors: Robert Altman, Bruce Beresford, Bill Bryden, Jean-Luc Godard, Derek Jarman, Franc Roddam, Nicholas Roeg, Ken Russell, Charles Sturridge, Julien Temple. Cast: Bridget Fonda, Elizabeth Hurley, Theresa Russell, John Hurt, Buck Henry, Beverly D'Angelo, Anita Morris. Ten of the world's best-known filmmakers contributed to this compilation film, each fashioning a short film inspired by an aria from a famous opera. The approaches vary broadly, from the playful abstraction of Jean-Luc Godard's segment, which illustrated Armide with exercising body-builders, to the more literal approach of Franc Roddam, who transports Tristan and Isolde's story to modern-day Las Vegas. A particular stand-out is Julian Temple's take on Rigoletto, which recasts Verdi as the accompaniment to a contemporary Southern California sex farce. Arias sung in Italian, French and German. 88 min.

""Bobby Eroica Dupea (Jack Nicholson) comes from a well-bred family of musicians, and once showed great promise as a concert pianist.

He took to the road, wanting to ""see the world,"" and hopefully find something or someone to quell his inner turmoil. He has settled in a small town as an oil rigger, where his life consists of going to work, arguing with his dimwitted but loving girlfriend Rayette (Karen Black), and bowling every night with his friend Elton (Billy ""Green"" Bush).

"Sopyonje (South Korea, 1993)","Directed by Kwon-taek Im. The specifically Korean tradition that is reclaimed in Sopyonje is the type of folk-song known as pansori, described as a musical sublimation of southwest Korea's collective grief and suffering - in other words, a kind of blues. The film's three central characters are itinerant pansori singers in the 1950s, a time when many aspects of Korean culture came under siege from Japanese and western influences. A man named Dong-ho is roaming the rural hinterlands, ostensibly to find rare herbal medicines for his sick son back in Seoul, but actually in search of Song-hwa, the woman he grew up with. Orphans, they were both apprenticed to the pansori master Yu-bong who pressured them to sacrifice everything for the art. Dong-ho rebelled and ran away, but Song-hwa stayed, lost her sight, and outlived Yu-bong. Rumor has it that she is still travelling and still singing pansori... 113 min.

"The Violin (El Violin) (Mexico, 2006)","Directed by Francisco Vargas. Cast: Don Angel Tavira, Dagoberto Gama, Gerardo Taracena, Mario Garibaldi, Fermin Martinez, Silverio Palacios, Justo Martinez. In rural Mexico, during the peasant revolts of the 1970s, Plutarco, his son Genaro and grandson Lucio lead double lives. On the one hand, they are simple country musicians, and on the other they actively support the peasant guerrilla movement against the oppressor government. When the army occupies the village, the rebels are forced to flee and leave their ammunition behind. Making the most of the fact that he looks like an inoffensive violinist, Plutarco has a plan: to recover the munitions hidden in his cornfield. His music enraptures the captain, but he still has to get his hands on the ammunition. Un bisou pour le monde: In this short film a primary school teacher shows her pupils some daily newspapers. As one of the students wants to look at the copy of Le Monde more carefully, he tears it into pieces. The teacher makes him tape the pieces back together, but the student's choices for where the pieces should go has a surprising effect on ""the world."" 98 min.
