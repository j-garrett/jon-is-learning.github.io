Boy, considered a dance film classic, turns an ordinary boy into a superhero as he moves with stealth and grace through a dramatic coastal landscape, responding to this empty universe, manipulating it and conjuring up his own imaginary world. In Burst, a couple's intimate dance in the bedroom is interrupted by a sudden and unexpected burst water pipe; the water may be cool, but this couple burns up the screen. Cargo presents one man's pit stop on the road of life, where he pauses to rest and contemplate whether to continue the journey; sometimes dark, sometimes funny and always sexy, the performer fills the interior of a 1969 Buick Skylark with his physical and emotional self. Case Studies is a faux-scientific investigation of ASDICT (Adult Sleep Disorder Induced by Childhood Trauma) in which we're privileged to see rare archival footage from the renowned (but fictitious) Groat Center for Sleep Disorders. The sensual film Horses never die delves into the mythic concept of metamorphosis; issues of birth, development, and renewal are ignited through movement. Motion control takes one glamorous and ageing dancer, traps her in the real world, then smashes into her private reality, and tries to control her movement, contain her emotion ; she already has you beaten in this bizarre journey of entrapment. The Duchess is a psychological portrait of a lonely and demented aristocrat, who is filled with long repressed memories and conjured demons. 2005. 50 min.

"Impromptus","Presents the first performance in which Sasha Waltz has developed a dance piece based on the structure of a classical music composition. The music was performed live onstage together with vocal accompaniment by selections from four Schubert pieces. The dance like the music creates in a subtle way emotional states between weightless floating and being off balance. Sasha Waltz explores in her work the existential questions of the human body with its vulnerability and beauty. This is dance at its most riveting, at once unmasking, manipulating, and ultimately exalting in the innumerable aspects that make us human.

What do origin, family and history signify today?

Singers: Gesa Hoppe, Cecile Kempenaers, Anne-Kristin Zschunke, Bettina Ranch ... [et al]. Sasha Waltz has developed her theatre-music production, the tragedy Medea from Pascal Dusapin's 1991 opera with texts by Heiner Muller. Reworked in cooperation with the Akademie fur Alte Musik and the Vocalconsort Berlin, the investigation of these materials allows the choreographer to bring all her artistic capabilities into play. In working alongside a large collective Sasha Waltz has found a happy correspondence with the music of Pascal Dusapin who has the coloratura soprano accompanied by a chorus (from vocal quartet up to twenty singers), as partner, echo and reflection. 70 min.

In NoBody Sasha Waltz investigates the metaphysical existence of humanity. The performance addresses the absence of the body, and it confronts the viewer with feelings aroused by the realisation of being mortal. What does being human mean beyond having a body? Which part of us is immortal? In NoBody, the choreographer, accompanied by 25 dancers, faces the challenge of rendering the non-physical visible through the physical body itself.

Le Bal takes place in a hypothetical Parisian dance hall and its plot is communicated entirely through mime, its pop music soundtrack and period ballroom dances.

The music begins and in a series of flashback sequences that use key moments in modern French history as their backdrop, viewers are presented with a clever yet poignant social commentary of prewar, postwar and modern times. 107 min.

Before the backdrop of wild rhythms and whirling bodies lies a tableau of young aspiring artists, striving to turn their fever into fame through hip-hop, graffiti art and break dancing.

"The Black Swan (2010)","Director, Darren Aronofsky. Ballet choreography, Benjamin Millepied; ballet costumes designed by Kate and Laura Mulleavy of Rodarte; ""Swan Lake"" composed by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Cast: Natalie Portman, Vincent Cassel, Mila Kunis, Barbara Hershey, Winona Ryder. Nina is a ballerina in a New York City ballet company. Her life, like most in her profession, is completely consumed with dance. She lives with her mother Erica, a former ballerina who exerts a suffocating control over her. When artistic director Thomas Leroy decides to replace prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre for the opening production of their new season, Swan Lake, Nina is his first choice. But Nina has competition: new dancer Lily, who impresses Leroy as well. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily is the personification of the Black Swan. As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side - a recklessness that threatens to destroy her. Special features: Black Swan: Metamorphosis [featurette] (49 min.); Sneak peeks (7 min.). 108 min.

"Flying Down to Rio (1933)","Directed by Thornton Freeland. Dance Director: Dave Gould. Cast: Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Delores Del Rio, Gene Raymond, Raul Roulien. This film, containing the first of many Fred Astaire - Ginger Rogers partnerships, concerns a troupe of entertainers stranded in Rio. Songs include ""The Carioca,"" ""Orchids in the Moonlight,"" and the title song. Notable for a brilliantly photographed finale with chorus girls on the wings of flying airplanes, the movie was the musical that broke with the rather contrived Busby Berkeley productions and moved toward a closer integration of musical and narrative elements. Astaire's dance numbers come not as interruptions but as extensions of the plot. 89 min.

"Wonder Bar (1934 )","Directed by Lloyd Bacon. Dance numbers created and directed by Busby Berkeley. Cast: Al Jolson, Kay Francis, Dolores Del Rio, Ricardo Cortez, Dick Powell. Proprietor Al Wonder, a master showman keeps the champagne flowing, the patrons glowing and the bills paid. In just one night at this merrily sophisticated Parisian watering hole, anything can happen ... and almost everything does. As in most of his film appearances Jolson, in effect, plays an entertainer based on his own stage persona. Berkeley's choreography is to be seen at its most imaginative and at a low point in Goin' to Heaven on a Mule, a number which embodies the patronising 'happy darkie' cliches prevalent in Hollywood movies well into the forties. Based on the play by Geza Herczeg, Karl Farkas and Robert Katscher. 84 min.
