"Eternal Beauty: Vision and Death Wish in the Third Reich","No other totalitarian regime is as closely associated with an artistic movement as Nazi Germany. From the towering architecture of Albert Speer to the grandiose films of Leni Riefenstahl, art fed into and shaped Nazi ideals, reflecting back a world where Aryan strength triumphs over all enemies. Through art on a monumental scale, Hitler created a world--and a worldview--as enticing as it was illusory...a world of eternal beauty. This program definitively examines the history of the Third Reich through the lens of its own artistic iconography--films that promoted German superiority, demonized Jews, encouraged love of the fatherland, and hid the fact that the nation, after reverses on every front, was steadily losing the war.

"The Fifth-column Mouse (1942)","Directed by Friz Freleng. Animated short. ""In this parable for the failure of appeasement before World War II, house mice are targeted by a hungry cat, who intrudes upon their idyllic life. When all but one of the mice successfully take refuge in a wall hole, the cat promises to the one mouse who didn't manage to escape, that he won't hurt anyone, provided he's placated with pampering by every mouse in the pack. Acting as the cat's quisling, the mouse speaks to his rodent brothers, telling them to appease the cat, to give the cat all the comforts he wants, and in turn the cat will live in peace with them. The mice are wary of the cat but agree to his terms. Not surprisingly, the cat's appetite isn't assuaged, and he soon craves a mouse dinner. He chases the mice back into their hole, and the mice reject appeasement and decide to fight against the cat. They go through military prep and manufacture an ultimate weapon, a wooden dog with mechanical gears and biting teeth, to combat the cat.""

""Alexander Korda's bit for the British war effort shows the world both at peace and on the verge of Nazi domination. Spliced together to form a documentary style film of both newsreel and acting. This first of its kind in propaganda films of World War II, shows the might of the English Empire and its eagerness to stand up to the oppressors of morality and free will. Crude but effective propaganda cinema that sets the tone for things to come. With its stiff upper lip attitude that pays tribute to the nations prides and shows the black plague of Nationalism spreading across Europe that England shall be motivated, ready and willing to retaliate.""

A collection of six films (and one bonus film) by one of the greatest figures in the celebrated British Documentary Film Movement. Humphrey Jennings is most remembered for the way his work reflects the concerns and conditions of the World War II era in the United Kingdom. These pictures document how Jennings's impressive aesthetic arsenal helped to expand the scope and vocabulary of documentary films. Listen to Britain: Written, edited, and directed by Humphrey Jennings and Stewart McAllister. A poetic treatment, using no narration, of the British people during World War II. A vivid tapestry of sound and image intersperses scenes of British preparedness and tranquility. Perhaps Jennings' most outstanding film, Listen to Britain celebrates the perservance of everyday behavior in the face of total war.

This American propaganda film stresses that the Japanese must be persuaded to adopt democratic attitudes and policies before they can expect to rejoin the community of peaceful nations. Directed by Theodor Geisel (Dr. Seuss). Produced by Army Pictorial Service, Signal Corps, 1945. ""Unlike its counterpart, Your Job in Germany, Our Job in Japan was probably never seen by either military or civilian audiences. By the time it was readied for release in March 1946, ""peace"" with Japan was a reality. Thus the approach to the Japanese is more magnanimous: they are portrayed as victims of cynical leaders who filled their minds with thoughts of world conquest. According to the film's director, Theodore Geisel, Our Job in Japan displeased General MacArthur and all prints of the film quickly disappeared.""

"A Film Unfinished","At the end of WWII, 60 minutes of raw film in an East German archive was discovered. Shot by the Nazis in Warsaw in May of 1942, the film became a resource for historians seeking an authentic record of the Warsaw Ghetto. The later discovery of a long-missing reel, including multiple takes and cameramen staging scenes, complicated earlier readings of the footage. Presented here is the raw footage in its entirety, falsely showing the 'good life' of Jewish urbanites. Contents: Lost history -- Jewish Council -- ""I might see my mother"" -- Flowers, furniture, teapot -- Auerswald's reports -- Willy Wist, cameraman -- Garbage and lipstick -- Waiting to die -- Smuggling -- Underground Jewish archive -- Surprising discovery -- Dinner and theater -- ""A Jew film"" -- Death -- Ghetto in color -- ""Today I can cry"" -- Faces.

"The Fuehrer Gives a City to the Jews (Fuehrer schenkt den Juden eine Stadt)","This is the only film known to be made by the Nazis inside an operating concentration camp. This insidious propaganda film was produced in 1944 in Theresienstadt, the ?model? ghetto established by the Nazis in 1941 in Terezin, a town in the former Czechoslovakia. Goebbels intended to use the film to prove to the International Red Cross and the world that Jews were being well-treated in the camps. The film is an elaborately staged hoax presenting a completely false picture of camp life. Upon completion, the director and most of the cast of prisoners were shipped to Auschwitz. Only a few survived to attest to the falsity of the film. Includes a filmed segment from a performance by prisoners of Terezin of Hans Krasa's children's opera Brundibar.

"Kennedy's Cold War: Keeping the Commies Covered","This film is a 1963 Pentagon Report, recently declassified, detailing the efforts of the United States to combat communism worldwide, both covertly and militarily. The film is unusually frank about geo-political situations in Vietnam, Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Cuba, and around the globe. Each global situation is discussed, states the U.S. goal, and the proposed solutions from an American point of view. Twenty-five years later, hindsight reveals that the facts were incorrect or distorted, and the policies flawed accordingly. The 1963 Pentagon Report is an object lesson in the facts being arranged to fit the conclusion. Produced by Army Pictorial Service. 39 min.

"Operation Abolition","This infamous red scare film was put together from television newsreel footage of the May 1960 House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) hearings in San Francisco, its attendant student protests, and the riotous police action (fire hoses used on City Hall protesters) that followed. Operation Abolition was widely screened (one source put the total viewership at 8 million) and helped put Berkeley and its activist culture on the map, eventually becoming a cult movie. Scenes include footage of Harry Bridges, Archie Brown, Douglas Wachter, William Mandell, University of California, Berkeley students and excepts from the Daily Californian. A film using the same footage, but a different narration called Operation Correction was made by the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California to counter Operation Abolition.

"Our Friend the Atom.(1958)","Directed by Hamilton Luske; Walt Disney Studios. ""Our Friend The Atom...was produced by Disney in cooperation with the U.S. Navy and General Dynamics, builders of the nuclear submarine USS Nautilus. As a ""Tomorrowland"" segment of the Disneyland television show, Our Friend The Atom relates the history of atomic energy, beginning with a clip from the earlier film 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, which erroneously maintains that author Jules Verne predicted the use of atomic energy. The film then progresses to an animated fairy tale of a fisherman who finds a bronze bottle in his net. Opening the flask, the fisherman is confronted by a genie, who explains that after centuries of confinement, he has resolved to kill whomever opens the bottle. The fisherman feigns surprise that so large a being could fit into the bottle. The genie returns to the vessel to prove that it can be done, and the wily fisherman corks the bottle up. Finally, the genie relents and promises to grant the fisherman his wishes if the bottle is uncorked. Says the narrator, ""The story of the atom is like this fable, come true through science. For centuries we have been casting our nets into the sea of the great unknown in search of knowledge. Finally, we found a vessel and, like the one in the fable, it contains the genie."" In a combination of live-action and animation, Our Friend The Atom moves from this fairy tale premise to an international history of atomic energy that culminates in American control of the technology. To soothe public apprehension, atomic energy is explained in terms of common household items. An atomic reactor, the viewer is told, is just like a big furnace. An atomic chain reaction is likened to what happens when a stray ping-pong ball is thrown at a mass of mousetraps with ping-pong balls set on each one. The narrator relates that an atomic explosion might be like the angry genie, but with the nuclear reactor and the magic power to transmute ordinary materials into radioactive tools in science and medicine, ""Here lies our chance to make the atomic genie our friend."" The film ends with the prediction that ""clean"" nuclear reactors will replace grimy coal and oil power plants. Radiation will be used to produce better crops and livestock. People will zoom from place to place in atomic cars, trains, boats and planes. ""Then, the atom will become truly our friend."""" [From: Langer, Mark. ""Disney's Atomic Fleet."" Animation World Magazine, Issue 3.1, April 1998]

What you're pledged to defend is essentially everything that can be claimed American, multicultural style.

"American Cultural History: Family Values.","The family remains America's definitive building block. Every generation sees its own peculiar upheavals in family values. The post-war '40s and '50s period was an epoch of serious questions about what constituted valid family values. These six vintage films examine the vacillations that were taking place in the American family in the early and late '50s and depicts the resultant lines of reasoning that evolved.

Distant drummer: flower of despair: Paul Newman narrates this history of the poppy plant from its harvesting for opium to its processing into heroin. Analyzes the ways and means of organized crime in importing and distributing the drug in the United States. Drug abuse: the chemical tomb: The dangers of drug use by teenagers are illustrated by showing how well-dressed, happy teens are turned into slovenly, long-haired, drug-addled potheads who don't know that, according to the film's drug expert, ""in high dosages, it [marijuana] parallels LSD."" Drug addiction: Uses animated drawings to explain the derivation of various drugs and the harmful reactions of marijuana, heroin, and cocaine. Relates the story of a high school boy who tries heroin as an ""experiment,"" steals in order to purchase more, and becomes a grave liability to society. Narcotics: pit of despair: Considered by many to be the greatest of all anti-drug films, tells the story of a good boy gone bad. John, a clean-cut high school senior, is targeted by Pete, a low-life drug dealer, as his next victim. Inviting John to a party, Pete tells him to ""blast off for Kicksville"" by smoking a joint. John proceeds to do just that and is immediately turned into a marijuana addict, who shortly starts shooting up heroin. Subject: Narcotics: Not intended for viewing by the general public, this film was produced for the use of police departments for orienting and training their officers on the issues of narcotic addiction and the social problems they present. Poignant and stark images throughout make it compelling viewing. The Terrible truth: Communicates the message that marijuana usage ultimately results in heroin addiction. The story gets told through the person of an innocent young girl who falls for the wrong kind of debonaire guy.

Assassin of youth: Puff--Party--Tragedy! A reporter exposes more than a drug ring when he poses as a soda jerk to ferret out a story - he snatches from them a good wholesome kid set up to become a pothead by her inheritance-hungry relatives in order to swindle her out of her grandmother's dough. Day in the death of Donny B: A classic period piece chronicling in cinema verite format a young black junkie living a life of crime on the streets of New York City in his never-ending quest for the next heroin fix. Ecstacy: Don't not let the name fool you: An unconventional U.S. Navy production intending to instruct recruits in the zero tolerance policy of the Navy towards drug abuse in general and the drug ecstacy in particular. Keep off the grass: Tom's mother discovers a marijuana joint in his room. When his parents confront him, Tom denies being a ""dope fiend."" He goes down to where the local ""weedheads"" hang out, is mugged by a desperate band of marijuana addicts, and finally realizes how right his parents were to try to get him to ""keep off the grass!"" Kinograms newsreel: ""Raiders confiscate a fortune of opium: Shanghai - Native police under foreign control set out on raids to break up illicit drug traffic"". What they also got was a huge contact high as Japanese troops & western officials set fire to the stash. Marihuana: This film is in many ways the great encapsulator of the bulk of mid-1930s drug madness. In this film, a young girl with great prospects smokes marijuana when she goes to a beach party with her boyfriend and ultimately ends up pregnant, abandoned and pushing narcotics as a result! Opium destruction, San Francisco: Another mass contact high induced by government agents who burn stash & hookah paraphernalia alike before an unfinished City Hall.

Dragnet: the big seventeen: Sgt. Joe Friday ferrets out the sordid details of what made a bunch of nice suburban kids go crazy and destroy a movie theater - you guessed it, it was reefer, of course! Drugs are like that: Florida orange juice spokeswoman and anti-gay activist Anita Bryant narrates this surrealistic film which in the process of presenting what is supposed to be anti-drug message by way of comparisons between drugs and other things in life unintentionally also produced a conciousness-bending drug culture camp favorite as well! Reefer madness: This infamous anti-drug film sensationalizing & demonizing the use of marijuana. Often referred to as a propaganda film, this spectacle is actually an attempt to cash in on a controversial topic of the day in the tradition of the exploitation film genre. Over time, it has become classic camp. In the film high school kids get hooked on marijuana, which leads to wild behavior, accidents and ultimately death and murder. Social seminar: Changing: A documentary investigating how the 60s youth struggled to find an identity in a world of contradictory roles, morals and values with special attention placed on deconstructing stereotypes such as hippie, hardhat, square, etc. Puts the drug question in perspective as it relates to adults and the total society.

Sinister menace: Extraordinary Dwain Esper production incorporating Egyptian newsreel footage documenting the smuggling, sale and use of narcotics in Egypt and that nation's distribution of these drugs to the world at large. Mystery of the leaping fish: The great Douglas Fairbanks appears in this improbable drug-induced fantasy about Detective Coke Ennyday and his delightfully confusing attempts to break up a smuggling ring and a loveless marriage while ""hopped""-up, literally, on a variety of drugs. Narcotics story: That damnable corrupting establishment, the malt shop, is the venue through which the crumbling of the morals of America's youth occurs, no matter how nice the kids, no matter if the drug proferred is marijuana or any other, this film tells the whole story ... from the first ""connection"" to the ""hooked"" adult. A semi-documentary with classic period footage of police drug searches and surveillance/detective methods. The pusher: A wonderfully trashy slap-dash omnibus of excerpts from a variety of bogus anti-drug films, most notably from the film ""Marihuana,"" presented as factual case histories, and strung together with a ""moderator"" whose over-the-top emoting throughout the film is the critical ingredient. Weed of death: An otherwise inexplicable feature which tells the incredible story of silent-era cowboys killing each other while stoned on reefers. Any other explanations can hardly do justice to just how weird this film is. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eDVD+8614"">DVD 8614Ж","Social, Educational, and Religious PropagandaЖ"

San Francisco Good Times: As the Vietnam war dragged on and Richard Nixon was elected to his first term as President, a group of people in San Francisco began publishing an ""underground"" newspaper called the San Francisco Good Times in the belief that out of the ferment of dissent a new community based on new ways of living and cooperation was taking shape. The paper was to be the voice of this community and a motive force in its creation. This film is a chronicle of people who worked on the paper and events they lived through and covered. The people who worked together to produce the paper went on to form a commune. In November 1972 the Good Times commune stopped publishing the newspaper. Highlights include a Black Panther demonstration in support of Huey Newton; stills of public nudity and marijuana smoking; an interview with Bill Graham; outtake from the song ""Sweet Marijuana""; Pete Townsend of ""The Who"" interview; the ""People's Park"" land squatting experiment that ended in armed confrontation; herbiculture; astrological column written by The Berkeley Astrology Guild; performance outtakes from The Floating Lotus Opera Company; interview with Timothy Leary; the formation of the Good Times commune ; San Francisco street life & happenings; members of Good Times arrested and put in prison; and more. Seasons change: A film detailing the truth about what a federal court judge ruled was ""a police riot"" in the city of Chicago during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Includes accounts of perjured testimony of policeman regarding innocent arrested citizens; harrassment of delegates by policeman; racially motivated police brutality; accounts by Rennie Davis, leader of the National Mobilization Committee; an account by poet Allen Ginsberg; an account by Tom Hayden, leader of the Students For A Democratic Society; acts of random and unprovoked violence by the police in bars, hotels and upon cripples; accounts by a speechwriter and aide to Senator McCarthy; CBS news coverage outtakes including convention footage, the roughing-up of Dan Rather on the convention floor during a broadcast, anchoring and interviews by Walter Cronkite and more; an account by comedian and political activist Dick Gregory; police beating of newsmen covering the convention; an account by British Parliament member Anna Kerr who was an innocent bystander who was brutalized, arrested and maced before TV cameras; various accounts by Mayor Daley; the violent assaults upon demonstrators in Lincoln Park and in front of the convention center; and more.

Hippie temptation: A CBS News presentation that manages a balancing act between a sober critical analysis of the idealistic and sometime naive youth revolution centered in Haight-Asbury and a cynical and culturally bigoted dismissal of the values of this subculture that challenged this very same cynicism and bigotry. Contains period film footage of life in the ""Haight,"" the geographic location most credited with the genesis of the psychedelic movement, some dualistically troubling footage of drug abuse and psychiatric treatment, and a special focus on the band whose home was considered to be the ""city hall"" of the subculture, The Grateful Dead, who not only give eloquent voice to the values of this new society but who also evince their principles with a free performance at Golden Gate Park. The homosexuals: A CBS Reports program that underscores the difference between modern (1966) sexual morals and those of the dominant culture. Mike Wallace attempts to give even-handed treatment to a subject very much taboo at the time by concluding that homosexuality is most probably a disease, mainly a male phenomenon, involving those incapable of maintaining deep and long lasting relationships. Gore Vidal makes an appearance and sounds a modern tone in the depths of this 40-year old stopped time piece, but his insights and observations are cut into pieces amidst much broader coverage of insistent anti-homosexual psychologists on the one hand and shadowy interviews with male homosexuals. A media history landmark produced in the same New York City that three years later saw the Stonewall riots that began the modern era of gay power activism. Boys beware: A film produced in the 1960's warning children against homosexuals, claiming that they are pedophiles preying on young school children. A police officer explains the many techniques homosexuals (sexual predators) may use on children such as praise, companionship, money, presents and becoming over personal to win over a child's trust.

"How to Be a Man: Instructions for Proper Male Behavior from Classroom Films of the 1940s-'70s","For centuries, parents have struggled to usher their children through the often treacherous journey to adulthood.

"How to Be a Woman: Instructions for Proper Female Behavior from Classroom Films of the 1940s-'70s","As the daughters of the baby boom reached adolescence, the American school system struggled to educate them on matters of sexual and social development. For teachers, classroom films about such topics were considered a godsend. They depicted the reproductive system in anatomical detail or through puzzling symbolism. Beyond sex education, classroom films addressed a wide array of social issues, from the importance of cooking skills to self-defense and how to appear more pleasing to others.

"Perversion for Profit","This propaganda film is a full-blown attack on the pornography industry. Its main thesis is, pornography corrupts and perverts the mind. The film makes outrageous and ridiculous claims (i.e. ""75-90% of all pornography bought ends up in the hands of children""). Using fear tactics to make its case against pornography the investigation varies from rape, to homosexuality, to sexual transmitted diseases, to illegitimate births. As a secondary persuasion method the film uses religion quoting the Bible several times. At the time the film was made in the 1965, pornography was a 2 billion a year industry and growing quite rapidly. Produced by Citizens for Decent Literature, Inc.
