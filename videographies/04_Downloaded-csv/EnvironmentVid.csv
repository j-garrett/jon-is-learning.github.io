"End of the Line","Charts the devastating ecological impact of overfishing by interweaving both local and global stories of sharply declining fish populations, including the imminent extinction of the bluefin tuna, and illuminates how our modern fishing capacities far outstrip the survival abilities of any ocean species. Scientists explain how this depletion has slipped under the public radar and outline the catastrophic future that awaits us -- an ocean without fish by 2048 -- if we do not adjust our fishing and consumption practices. Based on the book by Charles Clover (Bioscience & Natural Resources SH327.5 .C56 2004).

"Milking the Rhino","A ferocious kill on the Serengeti; warnings about endangered species... These clichés of nature films ignore a key landscape feature: villagers just off-camera who endure the dangers and costs of living with wild animals. The Maasai tribe of Kenya and Namibia's Himba -- two of earth's oldest cattle cultures -- are emerging from a century of 'white man's conservation,' which threw them off their lands, banned subsistence hunting and fueled resentment. They are discovering that earnings from wildlife tourism can rival the benefits of livestock. But change is not easy. Charting the collision of ancient ways with Western expectations, this film offers complex, intimate stories of Africans at the forefront of community-based conservation.

"Climate Refugees: The Human Face of Climate Change","Explores the global human impact of climate change and its serious destabilizing effect on international politics, turning the distant concept of global warming into a concrete human problem with worldwide consequences. Experts predict that by mid-century hundreds of millions of people will be uprooted as the result of sea level rise and an increase in extreme weather events, drought and desertification. Little is being done to plan for the potential mass migration of millions of refugees who will be forced to cross national borders. According to the UN, environmental refugees currently outnumber political and religious refugees. The Pentagon now considers climate change a national security risk and ""climate wars"" are discussed in war-rooms. Whether human-caused or a product of nature, the changing climate is already creating humanitarian disasters leading to worldwide political instability.

They also examine the censorship and intimidation experienced by dissenting scientists perpetrated by political and environmental activists who have an economic stake in the debate. The film also looks at the economic costs of a movement to discourage development in third world countries by those who claim industrializaton is a primary cause of global warming.

"The Spill","Martin Smith and Abraham Lustgarten explore the corporate history of BP before the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico. Their investigation reveals a history of safety and environmental violations. This investigation shows that British Petroleum's leadership has failed to create a culture of safety in their massive company. As BP took increasingly big risks to find oil and extract it, the company left behind a trail of mounting problems: deadly accidents, disastrous spills, countless safety violations. Each time, BP acknowledged the wider flaws in its culture and made empty promises to do better. From the refineries to the oil fields to the Gulf of Mexico, BP workers understood that profits came first. Through interviews with current and former employees and executives, government regulators and safety experts, Frontline correspondent Martin Smith and ProPublica reporter Abrahm Lustgarten examine the trail that led to the disaster in the gulf. Producers, Marcela Gaviria and Martin Smith. Originally broadcast as an episode of the television series ""Frontline"", October 26, 2010. 60 min.
