"Bulletproof Salesman","In a career spanning two decades of global turmoil, Fidelis Cloer, a self-proclaimed war profiteer, has supplied kings, presidents, and dictators with the finest armored vehicles that money can buy. In his world, where security is a commodity, violence and war present sales opportunities just as rain sells umbrellas. Following the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Cloer sold thousands of his hand-crafted armored vehicles. But as the war evolved, and armor-defeating Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) proliferated, Cloer found himself engaged in an arms race with insurgents who upped their explosives ante to defeat his increasingly higher (and more expensive) levels of armor.

"Inside America's Empire","The challenge of terrorism is likely to last for generations, and in a war without definable geographic borders or clear-cut victories, the threat may crop up anywhere. This documentary illuminates how the U.S. military is confronting this complicated challenge in unexpected and innovative ways, as chronicled by military correspondent Robert D. Kaplan of The Atlantic. Kaplan takes viewers to the Philippines, Mali, Colombia and the Republic of Georgia to meet the commanders and grunts on the ground who are waging the war on terror, often acting more as humanitarians than as warriors. Kaplan makes the case that this engagement with the peoples and cultures of the world -- offering logistical support, humanitarian aid and weapons training -- is integral to America's security and future prosperity.

As weapons and propaganda are ever more sophisticated, the very nature of war has developed into an `electronic battlefield'. But who is the real enemy today? Director & producer, Alan Lowery. 2010. 96 min.

Origins of revolution in the Atlantic world -- Lecture 3. Colonial empires on the eve of revolution -- Lecture 4. The North American revolution emerges. Revolutions and wars for independence: Sets the major themes of the video series, along with a discussion of the concepts of ""revolution"" and ""wars for independence."". Origins of revolution in the Atlantic world: Looks at the most important transformations that shaped the Atlantic world by the mid-18th century, including the Enlightenment, developing commerce and trade, the industrial revolution and new political theories which ushered in an age of political revolutions. Colonial empires on the eve of revolution: Between 1492 and 1750, the Spanish, Portuguese, French, and English had carved out large colonial empires. This lecture surveys those colonial empires, their dimensions and characteristics in 1750. North American revolution emerges: In the dissimilar American colonies, a sense of unity emerged out of the colonial wars that the English fought, especially with the French in the 1750s and 1760s. These decades precipitated the emergence of a sense of an ""American"" identity among the English colonists, eventually resulting in a move towards independence in 1775 and 1776.

Radicalism of the American Revolution -- Lecture 7. Slave rebellion in St. Dominigue -- Lecture 8. Haitian Revolution. From Lexington and Concord to Yorktown: Covers the fighting during the American Revolution from Lexington and Concord to the British surrender at Yorktown in 1781, an extraordinary story of a small group of colonials challenging and defeating the most powerful empire in the world. Radicalism of the American Revolution: Discusses the ""meaning"" of the American Revolution. For some, it was a conservative effort by planters to sieze power and control the development of a society already divided between slaves and free men, white and non-whites, and the landed and landless. For others, it represented a radical break with a monarchical past and a move towards a republic and democratic politics. Slave rebellion in St. Dominigue: The Haitain revolution is the only successful slave rebellion in the Americas. This section and the next analyze the only case of slaves rising up, taking power, and creating an independent nation. Also looks at the French revolution and its influence on Saint Domingue, a classic example of the sugar and slave plantation complex in the Americas. Haitian Revolution: In 1791, thousands of slaves rose up in St. Domingue, in a war for their freedom. Amidst the violence, a group of black leaders emerged, the most famous the former slave Toussaint L'Ouverture. Over more than a decade the slaves defeated invading armies from France, England, and Spain, but the black leadership eventually turned against itself in a struggle for control of the revolution.

Some news films were faked but some was authentic, obtained at great risk by daredevil combat cameramen.

Location filming by omnipresent government cameramen helps lend a raw, earthy feel to the desperate, life-and-death struggle against General Francisco Franco's Nationalist insurgents.

"The Moroccan Labyrinth (Laberinto Marroqui)","In 1898 Spain focused its colonial aims on northern Morocco, establishing a Spanish Protectorate in 1912. From 1920 to 1926, Spanish military attempts to conquer the territory were resisted by the guerrilla forces of Rif leader Abd el-Krim. The film reveals how this colonial conflict served as the prologue to the Spanish Civil War, with losses in the African war undermining the monarchy and politically emboldening the ""African militarists,"" including generals such as Francisco Franco, who in 1936 launched a revolt against the Spanish Republic. Ironically, in order to escape famine and poverty, thousands of Moroccans enlisted in the Spanish Falangist movement and found themselves fighting for their former enemies in Spain against Republican forces.

"Spain in Revolt (c. 1938)","Film summarizing events in the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), aimed at American audiences. The film appears to use mainly silent newsreel and other footage, with music and obviously foleyed sound effects added. While the film is mainly from the Loyalists stand point, there is also a bit curious pacificistic slant to it, keeping with the mood of the US at the time. However, if that is case, why was the film put together in the first place? Without the first reel to put the whole thing in context, it is hard to say.

Documentary about Unit 731, Japan's secret World War II biological and chemical weapons facility in the Chinese town of Harbin where biological weapons were developed during the Japanese Occupation. The film uses the same footage as seen from two points of view. The first half gives the perspective of the Chinese government and describes the horrors and atrocities that occurred during World War II at the facility. The second half, using almost the exact same footage, describes Unit 731 from the Japanese revisionist perspective which is largely supported by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in Japan. Although its cruel experiments on living people produced thousands of casualties, this activity is still denied by a number of Japanese historians and politicians. A film by James T. Hong. 2007.

"The Bombing of Germany","During World War II, bent on conquest, the German strategies became completely amoral, challenging and perhaps ending the concept of 'civilized warfare.' Through interviews with veterans, historians and ethicists from all the countries engaged in World War II, this documentary recounts the story of the Anglo-American bombing campaign against Germany, exploring the moral conundrums imposed by the reality of the war. Written, produced & directed by Zvi Dor-Ner. Originally broadcast as a segment on The American Experience in 2009. 60 min.

","â€¢149;December 7th: the Pearl Harbor StoryЖ","John Ford's uncensored version of ""December 7th"" was banned by the U.S. Government for nearly fifty years. This is the fully restored, 84-minute version, with subtitles added to the controversial Japanese language sequences and a special ""behind the scene"" introduction. (A completely censored 34-minute version of the film was released and earned John Ford his fourth Academy Award.) This full-length version stars Walter Huston as Uncle Sam and is set in Honolulu on the day before the Japanese attack. Uncle Sam vacations complacently in Hawaii, concerned with the on-going war in Europe. On Sunday morning, December 7th, air squadrons appear, ""swooping down like flights of tiny locust"". The attack on Pearl Harbor, America's first battle of World War II, is vividly presented.  (Feature film - 84 min.; Bonus materials - 76 min.);  (84 min.); also on

Why did Germans from all walks of life embrace the fascist Nazi philosophy and willingly follow Hitler into a titanic conflict and utter destruction?

Examining the public and private dynamics of Nazism's unhinged dictatorship by making use of an amazing array of never-before-seen film footage from secret archives and private collections, the film uncovers the deeper causes behind the rise and fall of Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich.

"Grilled Rice (Gao Rang)","A study on the North Vietnamese combat cameramen who filmed the Indo-Chinese and Vietnam Wars and founded Vietnamese cinema. Mai Loc and Khoung Me, two veterans from the French war, tell of acquiring their first cameras and instruction manuals. Mr. Xuong, a traveling projectionist during both wars, recalls projecting films along the 17th Parallel and public reaction to the films. Tran Van Thuy and Le Man Thich screen some of the material that they shot and describe the hardship and fear they faced in combat and during American bombings. For all of them, ""to make propaganda was obvious."" But they also discuss their regrets. Thuy says ""If we had had a more critical historical awareness, we could have left much better images."" They didn't film enough of the hard daily life, and regret the many ""heroic deaths that were not filmed, ""but it would have been ""useless,"" as the footage would not have been used. 2001. 52 min.

"The Catonsville Nine: Investigation of a Flame","On May 17, 1968, three Catholic priests, a nurse, an artist and four others walked into a Catonsville, Maryland draft board office, grabbed hundreds of selective service records and burned them with homemade napalm. This poetic act of civil disobedience helped galvanize an increasingly disillusioned American public against the Vietnam War.

"Little Dieter Needs to Fly","A film by Werner Herzog with Dieter Dengler. Growing up in post-WWII Germany, all Dieter Dengler, the son of a Nazi slain during the war, dreamed about was becoming a pilot. At age 18 he emigrated to the United States and worked odd jobs until he was accepted into the Navy and began pilot training. He was sent to Vietnam around 1966 and on his first mission was shot down and taken prisoner. There, the Vietcong tortured him until Dengler engineered a hair-raising escape and eventually returned to the U.S. His story is recounted here via interviews with Dengler, archival footage and new footage seamlessly spliced together. 2000. 74 min.

"The Long-haired Warriors","Vietnamese women have a long and legendary tradition of fierce warriorship -- a tradition exemplified in recent history by their wholehearted participation in the struggles against the French, the South Vietnamese Regular Army, and the American military. Ultimately, they shared in all those victories, but none came without painful losses and sorrows. This provocative documentary introduces a number of Vietnamese women who were active in the National Liberation Front, or Viet Cong, and shows how their wartime experiences shaped the rest of their lives. A highlight of the film is an emotional visit with four former prisoners to the infamous Con Dao prison camp where, from 1968 to 1975, they were among 600 women -- some as young as 15 years old -- kept in ""tiger cages"" and subjected to frequent torture and abuse by the American-supported South Vietnamese military forces. From disparate perspectives, these women universally express the conviction that their stories can provide a common thread of compassion to bind the wounds that divide people in the U.S. and Vietnam. They feel a bond with American wives and mothers who have also suffered profound losses. This engaging film examines the lives of some of America's former enemies and illuminates some surprising parallels and contrasts between their world and the world of the American filmmaker who seeks to discover their stories. It will stimulate discussion in a variety of courses in women's studies, Asian studies, and history. Produced by Mel Halbach. 1998. 60 min.

"The Mills of the Gods: Viet Nam.","""As direct cinema evolved, so did its commitment to supporting social change. The Canadian Broadcasting Company did much to encourage and extend direct cinema's impact by creating television series devoted to direct cinema films engaging social issues. The most influential among these was the program ""This Hour Has Seven Days."" The Mills of the Gods, a shocking look at the early stages of the Vietnam War, was the show's most controversial and influential production. Beryl Fox, who had already established herself as a prolific filmmaker committed tosocial change in films such as Summer in Mississippi (1965) about American race relations, takes her camera to the Vietnam War to record the conflict and allows viewers to witness, first-hand, the sorrow, futility, and inhumanity at itscore. The film reveals the horrors of the war: the wide-scale destruction, thebrutal civilian casualties, and the torture of prisoners of war. These scenes are contrasted with quiet shots of everyday life in Vietnamese villages, and with candid interviews with enthusiastic American soldiers and pilots, who allseem to love their work. The films most shocking sequences come from filming with an American pilot on a bombing raid. The pilot is overjoyed at his successful napalm drop. Fox then takes her camera down to the village that was bombed, and shows us the horrific carnage the joyful pilot had caused. The Millsof the Gods caused both an immediate sensation and outrage when it was broadcast. The BBC aired the program, and the film circulated widely in the US, mainly on college campuses. The CBC had to run disclaimers before the film thatit did not present the viewpoint of the broadcaster. The US was so outraged that it basically blacklisted the CBC from any important news event in Washington, DC. The film caused diplomatic tensions to rise between Canada and the US, and led the Canadian government to pressure the CBC, which cancelled ""This Hour Has Seven Days"" in 1966. The Mills of the Gods is a perfect example of direct cinema's ability to go deeply into divisive issues and of the reaction of the establishment to its unconventional style of reporting events. Fox made two more acclaimed films about Vietnam (Saigon, 1967; Last Reflections on a War, 1968).The Mills of the Gods stands as one of the most important films on that tragic conflict.""

"The Quiet Mutiny","In this, the first of his documentary films, John Pilger combines candid interviews and amazing frontline footage of Vietnam to portray a growing rift between the US military bureaucrats -- ""lifers"" -- and the soldiers who physically and mentally fight the war on the ground, the ""grunts."" By 1970, it is an internal sense of disillusionment and frustration born from this rift that is triggering the withdrawal of US forces from Vietnam. Pilger finds himself unable to glean significant information from the military and so it is with the grunts, that he finds a very human side to the US presence in Vietnam -- soldiers who are at once ready to serve their country and doubtful of their purpose there. They experience the war in a way many of their superiors do not. Filmed at Camp Snuffy in 1970, this film presents a character study of the common soldier during the Vietnam War, revealing for the first time the shifting morale and open rebellion of Western troops. Produced by Jeremy Wallington; reported by John Pilger ; directed by Charles Denton. Originally released in 1970 by Granada International Productions Limited. 26 min.

"Year Zero: The Silent Death of Cambodia","The first complete report of the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge and the devastating affects of US bombing in Cambodia during the Vietnam War. Year Zero was 1975, the end of the secret US bombing campaign against the Viet Cong that saw 100,000 tons of bombs dropped over Cambodia, and the emergence of the Khmer Rouge party as a ruling force. That year saw the desertion of the capital of Phnom Penh and the displacement of some 2.5 million people, the majority of whom would soon go missing. Pilger explores the roots of the US bombing campaign that began in 1969, contrasting it sharply with powerful footage of sick and starving Cambodians and interviews with relief workers with UNICEF and the Red Cross as well as imprisoned members of Pol Pot's regime. Produced and directed by David Munro; reported by John Pilger; edited by Jonathan Morris. 52 min.

"Winter Soldier","Vietnam veterans speak about atrocities committed upon Vietnamese soldiers and civilians during their time in the U.S. armed forces in Vietnam. Through testimony given at the Winter Soldier Investigation held by the Vietnam Veterans Against the War in 1971, press conferences, and interviews with individual participants, the film graphically portrays the effect of U.S. government policy and practice, which turned soldiers into animals bent on destruction and Vietnamese into ""gooks""--Non-human ""targets"" for murder, rape, and mutilation. The veterans struggle to come to terms with the devastation they caused so that others will not make the same mistake again. The Winter Soldier Investigation was held in Detroit, Michigan on January 31, February 1 and 2, 1971. Originally released in 1972. 95 min.

""Full of poignant footage and moving responses from children, exposes how the media has been used to earn public support for the U.S.-led military campaign against Iraq. The news coverage, as well as movies, television shows and video games that have incorporated the narrative of war into their storylines, has an especially profound influence on children, who often bring both entertainment and real-world violence to their play. This video examines how the ""good and evil"" rhetoric, in both the entertainment and the news media, has helped children to dehumanize the enemies, justify their killing and treat the suffering of innocent civilians as necessary sacrifice."" c2003. 37 min.

To record their war, from private reflections to real-time footage of improvised explosive device (IED) attacks on the ground, FRONTLINE creates a 'virtual embed', supplying cameras to the soldiers and working with them to shape an intimate portrait that reveals the hard grind of their war. The film intimately tracks the veteran soldiers of 'Bad Voodoo' through the daily realities of their perilous mission, grappling with the political complexities of dealing with Iraqi security forces, and battling their fatigue and their fears.

"For Life Against the War ... Again","In 1967, with the Vietnam War escalating wildly, an invitation was issued to filmmakers to create works running under three minutes in protest against the accumulating carnage. The original organizers chose the rubric For Life, Against the War, and eventually compiled sixty films. Now, decades later, an invitation to protest yet another war seemed sadly urgent, inspiring the New York Film-Makers Cooperative to ring the clarion once ""...Again."" The response was overwhelming, with submissions from several generations of artists unified by a singular disgust for the war in Iraq and the foreign policy that perpetuates it. Compiled with works from the overtly angry to the formally forceful, For Life, Against the War boldly announces that artists can take a stand, again and again.

"Full Battle Rattle","Before American soldiers are deployed to Iraq, they're given three weeks special training at the National Training Center on the Ft. Irwin Military Reservation, located in California's Mojave Desert. The National Training Center has constructed a simulated Iraqi village called Medina Wasl in the desert (one of thirteen such 'villages'), where new soldiers battle 'insurgents' (played by returning U.S. troops) and interact with 'ordinary citizens' (many portrayed by Iraqi exiles who've ended up in the United States) as they learn the ins and outs of combat in the Middle East. Full Battle Rattle offers a behind-the-scenes- look at Medina Wasl, the soldiers who learn there, the people who organize the war games, and the people who've been hired to play-act at being 'the enemy'. Directed by Tony Gerber and Jesse Moss. 2008. 85 min.

"The Ground Truth","Documents the stories of patriotic young Americans - ordinary men and women who heeded the call for military service in Iraq and Afghanistan - as they experience recruitment and training, combat, homecoming, and the struggle to reintegrate with families and communities. The terrible conflicts, depicted with ferocious honesty in the film, are a prelude for the even more challenging battles fought by the soldiers returning home - with personal demons, an uncomprehending public, and an indifferent government. As these battles take shape, each soldier becomes a new kind of hero, bearing witness and giving support to other veterans, and learning to fearlessly wield the most powerful weapon of all - the truth. Produced and directed by Patricia Foulkrod. Originally released as a documentary film in 2006; expanded from the director's 2004 short film of the same name. 78 min.

"Guantanamo","According to the Bush administration, the war on terrorism requires new tactics and new thinking--including departure from the Geneva Convention when deemed necessary. Guantanamo shows how that policy is implemented at Camp Delta, how it is vigorously defended in the name of national security, and how it is contested just as passionately on behalf of personal freedom and human rights. Firsthand accounts of experiences inside the prison compose the darkest dimensions of the story. Originally shown on the ABC television program 20/20. 2005. 43 min.

"No End In Sight","An insider's look at the decisions that led to the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq and the handling of the occupation. Based on over 200 hours of footage, the film provides a candid retelling of the events following the fall of Baghdad in 2003 by high ranking officals, as well as Iraqi civilians, American soldiers and prominent analysts. Examines the manner in which the principal errors of U.S. policy--the use of insufficient troop levels, allowing the looting of Baghdad, the purging of professionals from the Iraqi government and the disbanding of the Iraqi military--largely created the insurgency and chaos that engulf Iraq today. Producer/director, Charles Ferguson. 2007. 102 min.

"Outside the Wire","A documentary trilogy by independent filmmaker J.D. Johannes. ""Go outside the wire"" ...as he tells the complex story of the war in Iraq. The interviews with Soldiers and Marines were conducted at the combat outposts where they lived and worked. 'Danger Close' is an up-close, in-depth look at a complex attack by Al Qaida on a small, distant U.S. Army outpost on the edge of the Euphrates river valley. J.D. Johannes was the only reporter to witness the attack and followed the US Army paratroopers into combat --nearly getting himself killed. 'Anbar Awkens' shows the greatest turn-around of the Iraq War --the tribes of Al Anbar province joining with the coalition to fight Al Qaida --from the perspective of the Jumayli tribe. The Jumayli tribe --with no prompting from the Coalition --turned on Al Qaida and engaged in a serious gun-battle with Al Qaida before formally joining with the coalition. 'Baghdad Surge' is a look at the surge from asphalt level. This episode follows a U.S. Army infantry Captain through a 'day-of-the-surge' and the modern three-block-war. Written & narrated by J.D. Johannes ; shot & directed by J.D. Johannes. 2008. 110 min. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eDVD+9473"">DVD 9473Ж","Peace & Conflict Studies","General and MiscellaneousЖ"
