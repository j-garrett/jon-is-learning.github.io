"Algie, the Miner(1912)","Directed by Alice Guy-Blachâ€¢233; ""A gay-themed Western seems as though it could only be a 21st-century creation. But 93 years prior to Brokeback Mountain (2005), a gay cowboy named Algernon Allmore was already pioneering that cultural frontier in Alice Guy-Blache's comedy short Algie, the Miner (1912).
Algernon (Billy Quirk) is an effete city boy who is required to go West and develop some virility before he can have the hand of his girlfriend in marriage. Technically, he is not a homosexual. This was 1912 and, even in the most forward-thinking film, some sexual orientations dared not speak their names. Instead, Algie's character is defined as gay through certain visual indicators of behavior and dress: his tendency to give cowboys kisses on the lips rather than slaps on the back, his bright and flamboyant Western wear, and a penchant for lace hankies and lip rouge.
In one of the film's more inventive uses of visual metaphor, Algie's masculinity is represented by the size of his firearm. When he first arrives out West, he packs a dainty silver pistol, but as he becomes acclimated to the rugged terrain, he begins packing a more butch six-shooter.
While Algie acquires the manliness required by his future father-in-law, a secondary character emerges as an unexpectedly compelling figure: Algie's bunkmate Big Jim. When Algie tearfully nurses Jim through a terrible case of the d.t.'s, we detect some depth in their camaraderie. After Algie valiantly saves Jim from armed bandits, the burly prospector forms a curious attachment to the transplanted Easterner. And when Algie announces his departure from the West, to return to his bride, Big Jim assumes a posture of childlike sadness. It appears that Jim, not Algie, is the more romantically inclined. That a film could develop a relationship so complex, poignant and utterly unconventional in a scant ten minutes is a testament to the talents of director Alice Guy-Blach&eacute. ...

In conceiving the story of Algernon Allmore (the film has no credited writer, so we can fairly credit Blache with at least partial authorship), the director was probably influenced by the stories of Bret Harte. Greatly influenced by Charles Dickens, Harte wrote tales of rugged Westerners, and the stories were uncommonly tender -- often overlaid with shameless sentimentality. His short story ""The Luck of Roaring Camp,"" for example, tells of a mining community's efforts to care for a foundling. Years later, John Ford and John Wayne would film a variation on the tale entitled 3 Godfathers (1948).
The triumph of Algie the Miner is not that Guy-Blachâ€¢233; made a Western with an evidently gay protagonist. Her true achievement was that she managed to tell this tale with broad comedy, without insulting its central character. Even more astounding, she wove into this cartoonish story strands of heartfelt emotional yearning that continue to resonate almost a century later.""

Kustom Kar Kommandos is a voyeuristic look at a tight-jeaned man polishing his car. Anger's short films represent a vision of ""repressed homosexual desires, twarted in real life and painfully exorcized onscreen. Anger, a highschool student who had grown up on Hollywood's sanitized images, filled Fireworks with his hidden fantasies, complete with the bald sexuality inherent in the images of cowboys, test pilots and, in this case, sailors, images that dominated the dreams of millions.""

"Flaming Creatures. (1963)","Directed by Jack Smith. Sensual underground classic film which pushed the limits of its day while surviving attempts to censor its content, including a series of police raids, arrests, and court battles. ""It may seem tame by today's standards, but it stretched the limits of its day. Campy and lavishly designed in its experimentalism, [Smith's] best know film, includes characters which cavort in a setting reminiscent of the court of Ali Baba, with a mood suggestive of the paintings of Heironymous Bosch. The film is a quasi-documentary of Androgynes and Transvestites in which flaccid penises and bouncing breasts are so ambiguously equated as to disarm any distinction between male and female. In Flaming Creatures, Smith manages to combine the ornate imagination of his youth with the realities of his adult fantasy.""

"Poison. (1990)","Directed by by Todd Haynes. Cast: Edith Meeks, Larry Maxwell, Susan Gayle Norman, Scott Renderer, James Lyons. An interwoven trilogy, the film uses three distinct stylistic conventions to explore the writings of Jean Genet, arriving at a profound realization of poison in the human mind, body, and soul. a gritty prison drama reveals a homosexual's despair at being constantly confronted by forbidden passions; a campy 50's horror film send-up portrays a scientist's search for the essence of sexuality, and draws a compelling parallel to the HIV crisis when things go awry; and a tabloid mystery criticizes religious sentimentality as it revels the circumstances surrounding the murder of a wife-beater by his own child, who then flew out the window toward heaven.

Often cited for a number of gay subtexts (the relationship between Tony Curtis and Olivier characters for e.g.), Spartacus was one of the last Hollywood films to have homosexuality removed from its script by the Hollywood Code. Dalton Trumbo's screenplay contained a scene between Crassius (Laurence Olivier) and his young slave (Tony Curtis), in which the older man subtly establishes his bisexuality (the infamous ""oysters and snails"" dialog - SEE below). When the film was rereleased in theaters and on video in 1994, the cut portions were restored.

Crassus: Do you eat oysters?
Antoninus: When I have them, master.
Crassus: Do you eat snails?
Antoninus: No, master.
Crassus: Do you consider the eating of oysters to be moral and the eating of snails to be immoral?
Antoninus: No, master.
Crassus: Of course not. It is all a matter of taste, isn't it?
Antoninus: Yes, master.
Crassus: And taste is not the same as appetite, and therefore not a question of morals.
Antoninus: It could be argued so, master.
Crassus: My robe, Antoninus. My taste includes both snails and oysters.

"Stonewall (1995)","Directed by Nigel Finch. Cast: Guillermo Diaz, Frederick Weller, Duane Boutte, Bruce MacVittie, Brendan Corbalis. Who could have guessed that a bunch of men in dresses would breath life into the movement to win equal rights for gay men and lesbians? Certainly not the police who raided the Stonewall Inn, a popular ""drag"" bar in Greenwich Village. After a long history of police raids, extortion, and brutality, a gaggle of drag queens at the Stonewall decide they have had enough and begin to riot when the police try to load them into a paddy wagon. Told by ""La Miranda"" (Hector), a regular customer at the Stonewall Inn, the film is a recounting of events that led up to that fateful day in 1969. ""Matty Dean"" is the handsome angry young man that La Miranda meets at the Stonewall one day and with whom she/he quickly falls in love. ""Bostonia"" is the self-styled Queen Mother of the drag queens and guides each initiate gently ""into the life."" Her lover, Vinnie, is the closeted proprietor of the Stonewall. His tragic response to the suffocation he feels bearing down on him from a homophobic world -- perhaps as much as anything else -- sparks the riots. This is the Stonewall Riots ""As Told By La Miranda"".

"Strangers on a Train. (1951)","Directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Cast: Farley Granger, Ruth Roman, Robert Walker. Guy Haines, a tennis star, who hates his estranged wife and wants to be free to marry another woman, meets Bruno Anthony, who hates his father. Bruno has a chillingly simple plan: each could kill the other's victim. No motive, no clues, nothing to link Guy and Bruno but a casual meeting of strangers on a train. ""Bruno's (Robert Walker) homosexuality emerged in terms that would be used increasingly throughout the Fifties to define gays as aliens. His coldness, his perverse imagination and an edge of elitist superiority made him an extension of the sophisticated but deadly sissy played by Clifton Web in Laura (see Video 999:678), Peter Lorre in The Maltese Falcon (see Video 999:17 ), and Martin Landau in North by Northwest (see Video 999:166).""

A psychological drama about the effects of the sordid death of a man upon his cousin, whose life and sanity are endangered, and upon his mother, a wealthy New Orleans widow whose diseased adoration of her son draws her into his depravity. ""In the January 1960 Films in Review, the critic Henry Hart...concluded that Suddenly, Last Summer 'exposes clearly the foremost causes of homosexuality and...points to one of the horrible fates that can overtake this particular kind of pervert.'...In fact the 'cause' of Sebastian's homosexuality is certainly not explored in the film, which is concerned only with the effects of it--which are devastating to all. As for Sebastian's particular fate, it is unlikely that many homosexuals have died at the hands of cannibalistic Spanish-speaking street children. More have died at the hands of 'fag bashers' in American cities.""

"Ellen. The Complete Season Four(TV, 1996-1997)","Cast: Ellen DeGeneres, Joely Fisher, David Anthony Higgins, Clea Lewis, Jeremy Piven. Includes ""The Puppy Episode"": ""In 1997, Ellen made television history when the title character came out as a lesbian in the famous ""Puppy Episode."" (DeGeneres herself had come out earlier that year on The Oprah Winfrey Show and in TIME.) To ensure a memorable moment, the coming out scene was made into a gag where, at an airport, Ellen turns and tells Laura Dern ""I'm gay!"" â€¢8211; only to realize that she had turned right into the intercom microphone, announcing her sexuality to the entire terminal. Ellen DeGeneres' mother Betty can briefly be seen as one of the people in the terminal with a shocked reaction to the announcement. The revelation ignited a storm of controversy, prompting ABC to place a parental advisory at the beginning of each episode. Ellen was successful enough in its early seasons to warrant annual renewal, due largely to DeGeneres' perceived appeal and comic ability, but only with Ellen's coming out did the show make its way into the wide public consciousness and hit a critical plateau. However, after the initial coming out frenzy the show's ratings declined and ABC began feeling the pain of an organized backlash from religious conservative groups regarding the ""gay content"" being exhibited. The final episodes of Ellen were criticized for focusing too much on gay issues[1],a criticism begun in anti-gay circles but which spread to the mainstream media. Eventually, even some members of the gay community, such as GLAAD media director Chas Bono, began to criticize the show's serious new tone as well.[2] Soon after, ABC pulled the show from the air in May 1998 after five seasons.""

""The film stars Sheila McCarthy as Polly, a worker for a temporary secretarial agency. Polly serves as the narrator for the film, and there are frequent sequences portraying her whimsical fantasies. Polly lives alone, seems to have no friends and enjoys solitary bicycle rides to undertake her hobby of photography. Despite being somewhat clumsy, uneducated, socially awkward and inclined to take other's statements literally, all of which has led to scarce employment opportunities, Polly is placed as a secretary in a private art gallery owned by Gabrielle (Paule Baillargeon). Ann-Marie MacDonald plays Mary, who is Gabrielle's former young lover, and also a painter. Mary returns after an absence, and she and Gabrielle rekindle their former relationship despite Gabrielle's misgivings that she is too old and Mary too young. Polly, who's fallen a little bit in love with Gabrielle, is inspired to submit some of her own photographs anonymously to the gallery. She is crushed when Gabrielle dismisses her photos out of hand and calls them ""simple minded"". Polly temporarily quits the gallery, and goes into a depression. She returns to the gallery, and revives a little when Mary notices one of her photos. Mary and Gabrielle later visit Polly at her flat, and realize that the discarded photographs were by Polly. As the film ends, Gabrielle and Polly look at more of Polly's photographs and in a short fantasy sequence the three are transported together to an idyllic wooded glen.""

"Rocky Horror Picture Show. (1975)","Directed by Jim Sharman. Cast: Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick, Richard O'Brien. A mixture of fantastical rock opera and horror movie spoof, this film begins when a couple of ordinary, clean-cut kids have car trouble one dark rainy night and knock on the door of a looming gothic mansion. Once inside, the couple is stunned to learn that they have stumbled into an ongoing convention of kinky characters, hosted by the dominating, dynamic Dr. Frank-N-Furter, a mad scientist from the planet Transsexual. ""As a catatalog and spoof of old monster movies and science fiction films, Rocky Horror becomes almost dizzying in its references, but its most expert satire is of the age-old fear with which straight society encounters deviant sexuality.""
