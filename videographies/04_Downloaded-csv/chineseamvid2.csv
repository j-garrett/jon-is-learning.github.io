â€¢149; Gold mountain Dreams. In interviews with historians, descendants, and recent immigrants, this program traces the history and experiences of Chinese in the U.S., from the Gold Rush in California and the building of the Transcontinental Railroad, to the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act which barred their entry into the country. 
â€¢149; Between Two Worlds. In interviews with historians, descendants, and recent immigrants, this program begins with a description of the early 1880s when a wave of anti-Chinese sentiment swept across America, abetted by the Chinese Exclusion Act. Families were kept apart by both ancient custom and U.S. law. These immigrants were trapped between countries, at home neither in the U.S. nor in China. The law of the land, which separated these families, also provided relief as Chinese Americans turned to the courts for justice. Presents Chinese Americans contributions during World War II, and describes their struggles to prove their value both in war time and after returning home. 
â€¢149; No Turning Back. In interviews with historians, descendants, and recent immigrants, this program begins with the new immigration laws of 1965, which was a turning point for the Chinese in America and allowed a new wave of immigrants to enter the country. Provides information about discrimination against Chinese immigrants. Presents intimate portraits of the new Chinese Americans who face a struggle common to many immigrants: to reconcile some losses of their old culture in order to embrace their adopted American one.

For the first time, Chinese American men and women who were hunted down, jailed and targeted for deportation speak out on how they and their friends were investigated and persecuted by government agents during the McCarthy witch-hunts of the fifties.

"More to the Chinese Side.","""I used to think that we were the typical Asian American family,"" muses William Gow, a fifth-generation Chinese American of biracial descent, as several family members describe instances of how they are commonly mistaken for other ethnicities. Intrigued by thesemisperceptions, Gow invites his parents and other relatives to share their experiences and views on how they see themselves in relation to the larger Asian American community.
