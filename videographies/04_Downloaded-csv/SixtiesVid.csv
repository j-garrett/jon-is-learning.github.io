San Francisco Good Times ( 1977, 58 min.) -- The seasons change (1968, 45 min.) San Francisco Good Times: As the Vietnam war dragged on and Richard Nixon was elected to his first term as President, a group of people in San Francisco began publishing an ""underground"" newspaper called the San Francisco Good Times in the belief that out of the ferment of dissent a new community based on new ways of living and cooperation was taking shape. The paper was to be the voice of this community and a motive force in its creation. This film is a chronicle of people who worked on the paper and events they lived through and covered. The people who worked together to produce the paper went on to form a commune. In November 1972 the Good Times commune stopped publishing the newspaper. Highlights include a Black Panther demonstration in support of Huey Newton; stills of public nudity and marijuana smoking; an interview with Bill Graham; outtake from the song ""Sweet Marijuana""; Pete Townsend of ""The Who"" interview; the ""People's Park"" land squatting experiment that ended in armed confrontation; herbiculture; astrological column written by The Berkeley Astrology Guild; performance outtakes from The Floating Lotus Opera Company; interview with Timothy Leary; the formation of the Good Times commune ; San Francisco street life & happenings; members of Good Times arrested and put in prison; and more.

Includes accounts of perjured testimony of policeman regarding innocent arrested citizens; harrassment of delegates by policeman; racially motivated police brutality; accounts by Rennie Davis, leader of the National Mobilization Committee; an account by poet Allen Ginsberg; an account by Tom Hayden, leader of the Students For A Democratic Society; acts of random and unprovoked violence by the police in bars, hotels and upon cripples; accounts by a speechwriter and aide to Senator McCarthy; CBS news coverage outtakes including convention footage, the roughing-up of Dan Rather on the convention floor during a broadcast, anchoring and interviews by Walter Cronkite and more; an account by comedian and political activist Dick Gregory; police beating of newsmen covering the convention; an account by British Parliament member Anna Kerr who was an innocent bystander who was brutalized, arrested and maced before TV cameras; various accounts by Mayor Daley; the violent assaults upon demonstrators in Lincoln Park and in front of the convention center; and more.

The Hippie temptation ( 1967, col., 50 min.) / CBS News-- The homosexuals (1966, b&w, 44 min.) / CBS Reports -- Boys beware (ca. 1961, b&w, 10 min.) / Sid Davis Productions [in conjunction with] The Inglewood Police Department. Hippie temptation: A CBS News presentation that manages a balancing act between a sober critical analysis of the idealistic and sometime naive youth revolution centered in Haight-Asbury and a cynical and culturally bigoted dismissal of the values of this subculture that challenged this very same cynicism and bigotry. Contains period film footage of life in the ""Haight,"" the geographic location most credited with the genesis of the psychedelic movement, some dualistically troubling footage of drug abuse and psychiatric treatment, and a special focus on the band whose home was considered to be the ""city hall"" of the subculture, The Grateful Dead, who not only give eloquent voice to the values of this new society but who also evince their principles with a free performance at Golden Gate Park. The homosexuals: A CBS Reports program that underscores the difference between modern (1966) sexual morals and those of the dominant culture. Mike Wallace attempts to give even-handed treatment to a subject very much taboo at the time by concluding that homosexuality is most probably a disease, mainly a male phenomenon, involving those incapable of maintaining deep and long lasting relationships. Gore Vidal makes an appearance and sounds a modern tone in the depths of this 40-year old stopped time piece, but his insights and observations are cut into pieces amidst much broader coverage of insistent anti-homosexual psychologists on the one hand and shadowy interviews with male homosexuals. A media history landmark produced in the same New York City that three years later saw the Stonewall riots that began the modern era of gay power activism. Boys beware: A film produced in the 1960's warning children against homosexuals, claiming that they are pedophiles preying on young school children. A police officer explains the many techniques homosexuals (sexual predators) may use on children such as praise, companionship, money, presents and becoming over personal to win over a child's trust.

"Berkeley in the Sixties.","A film by Mark Kitechell. Contents: Pt. 1 Confronting the university: the Free Speech Movement-- pt. 2. Confronting America: the anti-war movement (32 min.) -- pt. 3. Confronting history: the counter-culture movement(45 min.). Through interviews with participants and archival footage, presents a history of Berkeley, California in the 1960s. This film is a celebration and tribute to the spirited rebellion of the students of Berkeley in the 1960s. It romanticizes the past in some ways, but the participants, many of them just as dedicated to causes as they were as youths at Berkeley offer realistic and honest remembrances from those hectic days. The film is in three distinct segments: Part I -- Confronting the University. The demonstrations began simply with students protesting the appearance of the House Un-American Activities Committee on campus to investigate communist appearances as speakers. It was the beginning of Speaker Ban. It tells of the creation of the student activist group known as SLATE, and the increasing confrontations with the University administration then led by W. Clark Kerr. 41 minutes. Part II -- Confronting America. Largely about the efforts to carry their activism beyond the campus and the narrow environment of Berkeley and Oakland. The issues of Civil Rights and Free Speech soon give way to protest against the war in a place called Vietnam. 31 minutes. Part III -- Confronting History. The emergence of the counter-culture in neighboring San Francisco, and the politicization of blacks as represented by Stokeley Carmichael and more especially the activities of Huey Newton and Bobby Seale and the Black Panthers creates a new environment for many of the people in this movement. Suddenly differences in perspective and scope of activism change. 44 minutes. Notes: Edited by Veronica Selves. Photographed by Stephen Lighthill. Narrated by Susan Griffin. Written by Griffin, Kitchell, and Stephen Most. Among those interviewed are: Frank Bardacke, Jentri Anders, John Gage, Jack Weinberg, Michael Rossman, Bobby Seale, David Hilliard, Ruth Rosen, Suzy Nelson, Barry Melton, John Searle, Mike Miller, Hardy Fry and Susan Griffin. Songs heard on the track include They All Sang Bread And Roses, Fortunate Son (Creedence Clearwater Revival), The Weight (The Band) The Revolution Will Not Be Televised (Gil Scott Heron) and The Jefferson Airplane's Embryonic Journey. 1990. 117 min.

"The Sixth Side of the Pentagon (La sixièeme face du Pentagone)(1967)","Directed by Chris Marker and Francois Reichenbach. On October 21, 1967, over 100,000 protestors gathered in Washington, D.C., for the Mobilization to End the War in Vietnam. It was the largest protest gathering yet, and it brought together a wide cross-section of liberals, radicals, hippies, and Yippies. Che Guevara had been killed in Bolivia only two weeks previously, and, for many, it was the transition from simply marching against the war, to taking direct action to try to stop the 'American war machine.' From young men burning their draft cards, to the Yippies chanting ""Out, demons, out!,"" to thousands of protestors rushing the steps of the Pentagon itself and some actually getting into the building, this is a remarkable time capsule and reminder of events from forty years ago, 1967-the turning point of opposition to a long and unpopular war. 26 min.

"The Whole World is Watching: Weatherman '69..","Featuring a cast that includes Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore, Mike Watt of the legendary hardcore band Minutemen, and Pettibon himself, this deadpan narrative pays dubious homage to the 1960's radical underground.

"The Homosexuals (CBS Report, 1966)","A CBS Reports program that underscores the difference between modern (1966) sexual morals and those of the dominant culture. Mike Wallace attempts to give even-handed treatment to a subject very much taboo at the time by concluding that homosexuality is most probably a disease, mainly a male phenomenon, involving those incapable of maintaining deep and long lasting relationships. Gore Vidal makes an appearance and sounds a modern tone in the depths of this 40-year old stopped time piece, but his insights and observations are cut into pieces amidst much broader coverage of insistent anti-homosexual psychologists on the one hand and shadowy interviews with male homosexuals. A media history landmark produced in the same New York City that three years later saw the Stonewall riots that began the modern era of gay power activism. 1966. 44 min. ;

Carter, Terry Crews, Ossie Davis, David Alan Grier, Nia Long, Paul Rodriguez, Saul Rubinek, Vincent Schiavelli, Khleo Thomas, Mario Van Peebles, Karimah Westbrook, Rainn Wilson.

Determined to make a film that matters, Melvin deals with two-faced backers, a rag-tag crew, threatening creditors, and various shades of Hollywood hypocrisy. With everything on the line, his only choice is to stick to his guns and do whatever it takes to get his neo-blaxploitation epic to the audience for which it was envisioned. 2004. 109 min.

""Bobby Eroica Dupea (Jack Nicholson) comes from a well-bred family of musicians, and once showed great promise as a concert pianist. By nature a restless, angry individual, Bobby left his family and his music when he could no longer endure the dull, cloistered routine of daily practice. He took to the road, wanting to ""see the world,"" and hopefully find something or someone to quell his inner turmoil. He has settled in a small town as an oil rigger, where his life consists of going to work, arguing with his dimwitted but loving girlfriend Rayette (Karen Black), and bowling every night with his friend Elton (Billy ""Green"" Bush). Not surprisingly, this routine begins to disgust Bobby and, fed up, he decides to travel to Puget Sound, Washington to pay his family a visit. Leaving Rayette at a nearby motel, Bobby goes home and is reunited with his family.""

Act one's theme is weather--hurricanes, twisters and floods with the appearance of Thor and his weather map. Act two is sickness with the Tinman and Glenda, the Good Witch in a rendition of ""Psychogenic infestation,"" followed by the appearance of Legba, the African god of rhythm. Act three is earthquakes with Frankenstein and Elvis fighting, but then the good angel appears to lead all in the grand ""Gloria"" finale number. Contents: Opening sequences (24 min.) -- Act. 1.
