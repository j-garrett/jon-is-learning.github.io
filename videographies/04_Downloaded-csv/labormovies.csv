"Female (1933)","Directed by Michael Curtiz. Cast: Ruth Chatterton, George Brent, Lois Wilson, Johnny Mack Brown, Ruth Donnelly. In director Michael Curtiz's romantic comedy Female, Ruth Chatterton plays Alison Drake, the iron-fisted president of a motorcar company. Alison oversees the daily operations of her male employees with a predatory gaze and frequently exercises her right to engage with them in any way she deems fit. She meets her match in an equally strong-minded new employee, Jim Thorne (George Brent), and the two engage in a smoldering, contentious, sexually charged duel. The action of the film--one of the first to depict a female character turning a man's world to her advantage--feeds on the novelty of presenting a woman as a corporate shark and bedroom hound. Though it's obvious the filmmakers thought they were creating a scenario that would never actually happen, Alison's world-smashing exploits make the bulk of the film (before she begins to question her nontraditional lifestyle) a protofeminist romp. Brent and Chatterton were married at the time they made the film, and the natural chemistry between them is abundantly evident. Curtiz packs the screen with extravagant set design and period detail. 60 min.

"Strike (Stachka) (1924)","Directed by Sergei Eisenstein. Performed by the First Workers' Theatre of Proletkult: Grigorii Aleksandrov, Maksim Shtraukh, Mikhail Gomorov, Y. Glizer, Ivan Kliukvin, Aleksandr Antonov. The first full-length feature project of pantheon Russian filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein, Strike is a government-commissioned celebration of the unrealized 1905 Bolshevik revolution. The story is set in motion by a series of outrages and humiliations perpetrated on the workers of a metalworks plant. The Czarist regime is unsympathetic to the workers, characteristically helping the plant owners to subjugate the hapless victims. Finally, the workers revolt, staging an all-out strike. Here is where Eisenstein's theory of ""the montage of shocks"" was given its first major workout. While the notion of juxtaposing short, separate images to heighten tension and excitement was not new, Eisenstein was the first to fully understand the value of using sudden-shock images (a bloody face, a fired weapon, a descending club) to make his dramatic and sociological points. Playing to mixed reviews and small audiences in Russia, Strike proved a success worldwide, assuring Eisenstein complete creative freedom on his next project, the immortal Potemkin. (Hal Erickson, Ѭ href=""http://allmovie.com"">All-Movie GuideЖ). Special features on : Glumov's diary (original title: Dnevnik Glumova): Sergei Eisenstein's first film, a short made to be used in his stage production of Alexander Ostrovsky's ""Enough stupidity in every wise man"" (1923; 5 min.); ""Eisentein and the revolutionary spirit"": film historian Natacha Laurent discusses Eisenstein's work in the context of the Communist Revolution and contemporary Soviet filmmaking (2008; 37 min.). 80 min.
