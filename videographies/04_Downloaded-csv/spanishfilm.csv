"Land Without Bread (Las Hurdes)(Terre sans pain) (1937)","Directed by Luis Buñuel. ""...Focuses on the Las Hurdes region of Spain, the mountainous area around the town La Alberca, and the intense poverty of its occupants. Buñuel, who made the film after reading the ethnographic study Las Jurdes: étude de géographie humaine (1927) by Maurice Legendre, took a Surrealist approach to the notion of the anthropological expedition. The result was a travelogue in which the narrator's extreme (indeed, exaggerated) descriptions of human misery of Las Hurdes contrasts with his flat and disinterested manner. Although some film scholars describe it as a documentary, Land Without Bread is actually an early (some might say prescient) parody of the barely invented genre of documentary filmmaking, according to anthropologist Jeffrey Ruoff.""

One couple re-enacts the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden, a woman plays at being St. Teresa de Avila while another man thinks he's a character from a Dostoyevsky novel, and yet another claims to have in his possession a fifth gospel from the Bible. Each has a special message to impart about the meaning of life and religion. 136 min.
