Helene Hallier, an ambitious by innocent would-be young chorine, trumps a music hall publicity stunt to become the new Parisian nightclub sensation. The light story is only a pretext for La Revue des Revues' white-hot, non-stop procession of outrageously and scantily attired exotic dancers, showgirls, and acrobats including the Tiller's Follies Girls, Ruth Zackey and the Hoffman Girls, and danseuse russe Lila Nikolska. But it's Josephine Baker, ""the high priestess of primitivism"" who triumphs in two show stopping numbers. 103 min.

"Sadie Thompson (1928)","Directed by Raoul Walsh. Cast: Gloria Swanson, Lionel Barrymore, Raoul Walsh, Charles Lane, Florence Midgley, James A. Marcus, Sophia Artega, Will Stanton. Arguably Swanson's finest performance of the silent era. A classic tale of Sadie, a loose woman who sails to Pago Pago to start a new life, only to fall under the influence of an unforgiving and overzealous preacher whose lust for her masquerades as a desire to save her soul. Unable to accept his sin, he cuts his throat and Sadie goes to Sydney with an admiring marine. Sadly, the final reel is currently lost. 97 min.

"The Jazz Age","Depicts life in America during the 1920's, a prosperous era of excessive pleasure-seeking which has come to be known as the Jazz Age. After World War I to the Great Crash of 1929, America went through a profound and exhilarating change in morals and manners. Much of the footage is drawn from newsreels and period motion pictures and goes beyond the stereotypes of flappers and gangsters to create a portrait of life on Main Street, as well as depicting the frenetic energy of nightclubs, jazz bands and chorus lines. Contents: A nation searches for ""normalcy"" after WWI -- New manners, new morals -- Big business in bootleg hooch -- Spotlight on Chicago gangsters -- Trans-Atlantic cruise boom -- Artists and writers flock to Paris -- All eyes on lucky Lindy -- Jazz age sports heroes -- Americans become fearless stock speculators -- Wall St. lays an egg.

Follows the life of Howard Hughes as the twentysomething millionaire, having already made a fortune improving the design of oil-drilling bits, who comes to Hollywood with an interest in getting into the picture business. It doesn't take long for Hughes to jump from producer to director of his first major film project, a World War I air epic. The film was a massive hit, and the eccentric inventor became a mogul in Hollywood, making Jean Harlow a star and enjoying a romance with Katharine Hepburn. But Hollywood's old-boy network never fully accepted Hughes, and in time his passion for flying began to reclaim his attentions. In time he began designing new planes, setting air speed records, flying around the world, and risking his life testing aircraft. Hughes also found time to romance Ava Gardner and founded his own airline, Trans-World Airlines. As his ideas became bolder and more eccentric, he gained many powerful enemies. 170 min.

Cast: Marion Cotillard, Sylvie Testud, Pascal Greggory, Emmanuelle Seigner, Jean-Paul Rouve, Gerard Depardieu, Clotilde Courau, Jean-Pierre Martins, Catherine Allegret, Marc Barbe. Raised in a brothel, then wrested from the only life she knew by her father, so they could join the circus, Edith Piaf spent her teen years on the streets. She is finally ""rescued"" by a crime figure who gives her career a start and, ultimately, by her international success and final illness. Always frail, sickly, malnourished, and wildly temperamental, she was often on drugs or alcohol and was always in search of true love. Middleweight boxer, Marcel Cerdan, captures her heart and gives her something to live for, besides her music--at least for a while. Special features: ""Stepping into character:"" an exclusive behind the scenes look at Marion Cotillard's transformation into Edith Piaf's character, including an interview with the director and award-winning Marion Cotillard; Edith Piaf documentary. 141 min.

"Zelig (1983)","Directed by Woody Allen. Cast: Woody Allen, Mia Farrow, Susan Sontag, Saul Bellow. This spoof of documentary films stars Woody Allen as Leonard Zelig, the famous ""Chameleon Man"" of the 1920's, whose personality was so vague he would assume the characteristics of whomever he came into contact with. Filmed in black-and-white, the movie simulates the look of a newsreel, complete with stentorian narration. 79 min. ; ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eDVD+1014"">DVD 1014Ж, Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/evhs+999:803"">vhs 999:803Ж","â€¢149;Ѭ href=""http://us.imdb.com/Title?0086637"">Credits and other information from the Internet Movie DatabaseЖ
