"Bad Day at Black Rock (1954)","Directed by John Sturges. Cast: Spencer Tracy, Robert Ryan, Anne Francis, Dean Jagger, Walter Brennan, John Ericson, Ernest Borgnine, Lee Marvin, Russell Collins, Walter Sande. ""Bad Day at Black Rock is both a tightly-written, suspenseful, dramatic action film (with film noirish qualities) and a western. On the surface, this American film classic is concerned with the themes of individual integrity, group conformity and complacency, and civic responsibility. It can also be seen as a powerful, allegorical indictment of the Hollywood blacklist, created during the climate of suspicion and fear of the 1950s McCarthy era. The message of director John Sturges' taut and influential film can be interpreted with different levels of meaning, but predominantly as the tense portrayal of a one-armed stranger who intrusively has arrived in a half-forgotten desert town filled with ruffians. Over a twenty-four hour period, he finds himself unwelcome and facing several ominous characters, animosity, collective guilt, hypocrisy, and bigotry. The film builds suspense by withholding information about the visitor's mysterious mission, and by creating a who-dun-it mystery regarding the hostile town's secret. Eventually, he learns the town's dark secret, and fulfills the promise he made to present a posthumous Congressional Medal of Honor for heroism to the farming father of a Japanese wartime buddy who had saved his life in World War II on the battlefields of Italy.""

"Bonanza","1960's television western program. Cast: Dan Blocker, Michael Landon, Lorne Greene, Pernell Roberts. For MRC holdings, Ѭ href=""http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/tv.html#Westerns"">SEE TV videographyЖ
A regular character of the series is the cook Hop Sing, played by veteran actor Victor Sen Yung. ""Hop Sing was the Cartwright family's cook on the US television series Bonanza which ran on the NBC network from 1959-73. Victor Sen Yung played the Chinese immigrant. Although the character may have promoted some Chinese-American stereotypes, such as his being a servant (an economic niche also shared by African Americans in the American South), he is not commonly cited as an offensive use of Asian characters. The Chinese were historically marginalized in the labor market of the American west into niches where they would not compete with Caucasians. Marlo Thomas was also cast as a Chinese in one episode, and other prominent Chinese Americans would also be cast on Bonanza. During the western's fourteen year run, just two episodes centred around the character. The first dealt with Hop Sing saving Little Joe from a false murder charge via the ancient science of fingerprinting or (as Hop Sing referenced) ""chops"". The second episode, written by Michael Landon, dealt with Caucasian biases against Asians in the 1880s, when Hop Sing fell in love with a white woman.""

""Richard Hardy, a hardworking stockbroker, labors overtime to keep up with the ruinous bills incurred by his beautiful but irresponsible wife Edith, a venal, spoiled socialite who is impervious to his pleas for fiscal restraint. Acting on what she believes to be an insider information, she impulsively embezzles $10,000 from the Red Cross charity she chairs for a stock tip. When she finds the money has been lost, she desperately turns to a Japanese ivory trader with whom she has been thoughtlessly flirting and persuades him to replace the money in exchange for an assignation. When her husband's long-awaited business deal finally materializes, she desperately tries to withdraw from their agreement by replacing the money. Angered and disappointed with her resistance to his advances, he uses a branding device to mark her shoulder as his property. Feeling violated, Edith shoots him in the shoulder and leaves.

"Charlotte Sometimes (2002)","Director, Eric Byler. Cast: Jacqueline Kim, Michael Idemoto, Eugenia Yuan, Matt Westmore, Shizuko Hoshi, Kimberly-Rose Wolter. Shot on video in and around Los Angeles's bohemian Silver Lake district, Eric Byler's ""Charlotte Sometimes"" is a small, subtle character study about a young Asian-American, Michael (Michael Idemoto), who by day repairs cars and by night manages a small apartment building that belongs to his aunt. Michael, a young mechanic, is forced to choose between a daring tryst with an alluring stranger (Jacqueline Kim) and the habitual comfort of his bittersweet obsession, his beautiful young roommate. ""Like almost every domestic drama with an Asian connection, ''Charlotte Sometimes'' has been compared to the work of Yasujiro Ozu, the Japanese master of emotional understatement. But ''Charlotte Sometimes'' seems closer in spirit to the work of the French filmmaker Eric Rohmer, sharing his fascination with courtship rituals among the young and the paradoxes of desire.""

"Go For Broke! (1951)","Directed by Robert Pirosh. Cast: Van Johnson, Gianna Maria Canale, Warner Anderson, Lane Nakano, Henry Nakamura, George Miki, Henry Oyasato. ""Go for broke"" was the combat slogan of one of World War II's most unusual fighting teams. The 442nd Regiment, comprised of Nisei--loyal Americans of Japanese ancestry--exhibits heroism far beyond the call of duty, overcoming the Nazis as well as the extreme prejudice of the white Americans who cannot accept ""Japs"" on their side. In this historically based drama a bigoted lieutenant rides the Nisei hard in basic training, creating enormous hostility-- but also resulting in a highly-disciplined fighting force that proves to be a major factor in the liberation of Italy and France. ; ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eDVD+2879"">DVD 2879Ж, Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/evhs+999:1150"">vhs 999:1150Ж","â€¢149;Ѭ href=""http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0043590/"">Information about this film from the Internet Movie DatabaseЖ

""The film's main drawback, however, is the premise--a group of white actors dressing up and acting like ""Chinamen"" (comedian Charley Chase is particularly embarrassing doing an awful Fu Manchu/Charlie Chan impersonation), including everyone from the band to the waiters. Leon Errol does his patented drunk routine but it doesn't seem to really have anything to do with the movie--it just involves him and a waiter for a minute or two and then they're gone--and a quartet of black singers does a clever ""hum"" of ""Chinatown My Chinatown"".

They refuse to accept the stranger, preferring that Gerrit rekindle his courtship of Nettie, a local girl. Cultural differences come between the young couple when the husband rejects his wife's religious faith and confesses his love for Nettie.

"Picadilly (1929)","Direced by E.A. Dupont. Cast: Anna Mae Wong, Jameson Thomas, Gilda Gray, Charles Laughton, Cyril Ritchard, Hannah Jones. ""Just before making his talkie directorial debut with Atlantic, director E.A. DuPont dashed off the silent ""backstage"" drama Piccadilly. By the time the film was released in 1929, talking pictures had taken a firm hold of the British film industry, obliging DuPont to reshoot much of the picture with dialogue. American screen favorites Anna May Wong and Gilda Gray (the girl who popularized the ""shimmy dance"") head the cast, the former as Shosho, a dishwasher in the London nightclub where the latter, cast as dancer Mabel Greenfield, performs nightly. Jealous of Mabel's dancing partner Victor Smiles (Cyril Ritchard), club owner Wilmot (Jameson Thomas) fires Victor, whereupon business drops off dramatically. In desperation, Wilmot takes Shosho out of the kitchen and puts her on stage, where she scores a big success. Feeling threatened by Shosho, Mabel heads to her rival's apartment with blood in her eye. A shot rings out, Shosho falls dead, and Mabel is accused of murder. But during the trial, it turns out that Shosho was done in by her Chinese sweetheart Jim (Kim Ho Chang). In his first feature film appearance, Charles Laughton performs an outrageous bit as a rowdy night club patron; also seen in a minuscule role is young Ray Milland.

"The Tong Man (1919)","Director, William Worthington. Cast: Sessue Hayakawa, Helen Jerome Eddy, Mare Robbins,Toyo Fujita, Jack Abbe. ""Hatchet man"" Hayakawa is in love with a merchant's daughter. He is ordered to kill the merchant but instead does his best to save him in this story about opium and the Chinese Mafia. 58 min. ; 
""Seeking creative control over his films, Japanese American actor Sessue Hayakawa established Haworth Pictures in 1918. (See also The Dragon Painter, December 4.) The first year out, he produced and starred in The Tong Man, a somewhat incendiary melodrama set in San Francisco's Chinatown. The story concerns a Tong hatchetman who refuses to murder his sweetheart's father. All manner of criminal activity-murder, extortion, drug dealing, kidnapping-transpires in this action-packed version of Romeo and Juliet whose delicate heroine is played by Helen Jerome Eddy, an obviously Anglo actress. The Tong Man's mismanagement of cultural imagery is ironically undercut by the subtle but daring possibility that a non-white leading man could win the love of a Caucasian actress. Nevertheless, the questionable depiction of Chinese culture caused an uproar in the community; an injunction against the film's exhibition was sought by San Francisco's Six Companies, and denied.""

Voices: Peggy Lee, Barbara Luddy, Larry Roberts, Bill Thompson, Bill Baucon, Steve Freberg, Verna Felton, Alan Reed, George Givot, Dallas McKennon, Lee Millar. An animated musical about Lady, a lovingly pampered cocker spaniel, and Tramp, a jaunty freedom-loving mutt with a heart of gold, who share an enthralling romance and thrilling adventures.
One of the most well-recognized racist symbols perpetuated by Disney is the portrayal of Siamese cats in Lady and the Tramp. Like stereotypical Asians, they are buck-toothed and have slanted eyes, and speak in ridiculously exaggerated accents that bear little, if any, resemblance to actual Thai speech patterns. They were portrayed as cunning, manipulative, and evil. ; ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eDVD+132"">DVD 132Ж, Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVHS+999:1958"">VHS 999:1958Ж","â€¢149;Ѭ href=""%20http://us.imdb.com/Title?0048280"">Credits and other information from the Internet Movie DatabaseЖ
