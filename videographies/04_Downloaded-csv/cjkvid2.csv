"731: Two Versions of Hell","Version 1: The doorway to hell (15 min.) -- Version 2: War is hell (12 min.) Documentary about Unit 731, Japan's secret World War II biological and chemical weapons facility in the Chinese town of Harbin where biological weapons were developed during the Japanese Occupation. The film uses the same footage as seen from two points of view. The first half gives the perspective of the Chinese government and describes the horrors and atrocities that occurred during World War II at the facility. The second half, using almost the exact same footage, describes Unit 731 from the Japanese revisionist perspective which is largely supported by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in Japan. Although its cruel experiments on living people produced thousands of casualties, this activity is still denied by a number of Japanese historians and politicians. A film by James T. Hong. 2007.

"The Red Chapel (Det røde kapel)","A one-of-a-kind documentary that reveals the injustices of North Korea with a hilariously dark wit ... a trio of Danish comedians, who call themselves ""The Red Chapel"", pretend to be regime sympathizers and mount an absurd variety show in Pyongyang. This stunt is led by the acerbic director Mads Brügger, and assisted by two Danish performers of Korean descent: bulky, tattooed, guitar-banging hipster Simon Jul, and his spiky-haired cohort Jacob Nossell, who has cerebral palsy and occasionally uses a wheelchair. Constantly shadowed by their guide, Mrs. Pak, they fake allegiance to Kim Jong-il and hope for ""One Korea."" Only Jacob is allowed to speak his mind. Suffering from cerebral palsy, his halting speech is impossible to translate, so he insults his socialist hosts and receives smiles in return ... an unconventional, hilarious and damning peek into a totalitarian nightmare.
