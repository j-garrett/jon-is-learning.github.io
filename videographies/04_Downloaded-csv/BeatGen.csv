"The Ballad of Greenwich Village: Culture and Counter-culture","The artists, rebels, and bohemians who came to New York's Greenwich Village over many decades changed the face of American culture through their art and politics. This film portrays the important political and social movements that began in the Village: the first interracial jazz club, the earliest Socialist newspapers from before World War I, the Stonewall Rebellion. This unique history includes anecdotes from many famous writers, musicians and performers who got their start in the Village. Interweaves past and present, with 16mm footage, archival photographs, Hollywood movies, cartoons, informative interviews and scenes of contemporary village life.

"The Beats: An Existential Comedy","A film that captures the magic of the Beat generation and their continuing legacy expands into a larger discussion of what it meant to be a poet in America when the ignoble spirit of McCarthyism was loose in the land.

"William S. Burroughs: A Man Within","A documentary of William Burroughs: the Beats éminence grise, ""literary outlaw,"" culture hero to generations of poets, musicians, artists, and filmmakers who had their minds blown by his 1959 classic, banned-in-America ""Naked Lunch."" This film covers his life in a straightforward manner, but the portrait drawn is at odds with the character who wrote in outlandish graphic detail about then-forbidden sexuality in the 1950s and '60s. Harvard-educated and conservative in his attire, Burroughs--despite fame and acclaim--was troubled, reserved, and battled with addiction his entire life. Despite the openness of his prose, this film reveals Burroughs in the contradictions he embodied--a man generously affectionate with friends and acolytes, whose avuncular veneer covered up a haunting, enduring loneliness.

"The Beats: An Existential Comedy","A film that captures the magic of the Beat generation and their continuing legacy expands into a larger discussion of what it meant to be a poet in America when the ignoble spirit of McCarthyism was loose in the land. From Venice to North Beach to Greenwich Village, the Beats found answers in Buddhism, friendship, and the power of their words. Using an emotional tone which is exactly right and a lovely style of filmic poetry, the beats are immortalized here with heart and soul. Featuring: Aya, Shirley Clarke, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Allen Ginsberg, Jack Hirschman, Stuart Z. Perkoff, Frank T. Rios, Viva, Andy Warhol. 60 min.

In Fireworks a dissatisfied dreamer awakes, goes out in the night seeking a light and is drawn through the needle's eye to return less empty than before. Puce Moment reflects Anger's concerns with the myths and decline of Hollywood. Rabbitt's Moon is a fable of the unattainable (the Moon) combining elements of Commedia dell'Arte with Japanese myth. Eaux d'Artifice portrays hide and seek in a night-time labyrinth of levels, cascades, balustraces, grottoes and fountains. Kustom Kar Kommandos is a voyeuristic look at a tight-jeaned man polishing his car. Anger's short films represent a vision of ""repressed homosexual desires, twarted in real life and painfully exorcized onscreen. Anger, a highschool student who had grown up on Hollywood's sanitized images, filled Fireworks with his hidden fantasies, complete with the bald sexuality inherent in the images of cowboys, test pilots and, in this case, sailors, images that dominated the dreams of millions.""

"Lost, Lost, Lost.Ж(1949-63)","Filmed between 1949 and 1963, these 6 reels of film diary by experimental filmaker, Jonas Mekas, begin with his arrival in New York from Lithuania and move on to deal with his life as a young poet and displaced person in Brooklyn. It shows the Lithuanian immigrant community and their attempts to adapt to a new land. Reel 3 and 4 deal with his first contacts with New York poetry and filmmaking communities including friendships with Robert Frank, LeRoi Jones, Allen Ginsberg, and Frank O'Hara. Reels 5 and 6 include a series of haikus filmed in Vermont, scenes at the Film-Maker's Cooperative, scenes of New York City, a trip to Flaherty Seminar, and countryside scenes.
""Given the Beats' feelings about American culture, many Beat works communicate a sense of cultural displacement. Lost, Lost, Lost... and Mekas' Guns of the Trees deeply affecting portraits of what it feels like in America in the fifties to be a ""displaced person""--in all senses: linguistically, culturally, socially, imaginatively, and artistically. For a viewer with the patience to live through the experience along with Mekas, Lost, Lost, Lost is one of the most profoundly sad and moving works of the period. Both Lost, Lost, Lost and Guns of the Trees also demonstrate how for Mekas and his characters, as in the Beat movement more generally, the state of social marginality and imaginative alienation, however personally painful to experience, conferred some degree of freedom.
