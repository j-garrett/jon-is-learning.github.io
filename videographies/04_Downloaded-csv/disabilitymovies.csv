"Million Dollar Baby (2004)","Directed by Clint Eastwood. Cast: Clint Eastwood, Hillary Swank, Morgan Freeman, Anthony Mackie. Frankie is a former boxing manager, who initially refuses to train Maggie due to her gender and age. With her talent and his coaching the spirited young fighter rises through the ranks of women's boxing, the pair form a touching bond in the process. ""The film has raised a great deal of controversy over a theme that, while a vital part of the film, has been underplayed in its marketing campaign and carefully skirted in reviews. At issue is the film's depiction of assisted suicide. When the fighter portrayed by Swank receives a sucker punch in the ring, she is paralyzed from the neck down. Unwilling to live that way, she begs Eastwood's character to help her die, and finally, after much soul-searching, he does.""

His younger brother, Charlie, seems unfazed by his brother's eccentricities or his mother's seeming disinterest. When Lee comes to the asylum to spring Hank for a week in Florida so that he can be tested as a possible bone marrow donor for Bessie, Hank is incredulous. ""I didn't even know you had a sister,"" he says. ""Remember, every Christmas, when I used to say 'Well, looks like Aunt Bessie didn't send us a card again this year?'"" ""Oh yeah,"" Hank says.

But all this is thrown to the wind one day when both Enio's ex-wife and Pedo's wife die in a car accident. Descending into the jagged world of his obsessive mind, Pedro despairs until he meets Lucia, a young woman with whom, in a parallel to his snooker techniques, he bizarrely tries to re-live the same exact moments he once lived with his wife. Enio on the other hand, is forced to confront his loss through the mysterious appearance of his unknown daughter, who forces a somewhat clumsy relationship with him by deciding to look after him.

"From the Life of the Marionettes (Ur marionetternas liv) (1980)","Directed by Ingmar Bergman. Cast: Robert Atzorn, Christine Buchegger, Martin Benrath, Rita Russek, Lola Muethel. Peter and Katerina seem to have a perfect marriage but beneath the facade lies a loveless marriage. Locked in a desolate relationship, Peter often dreams of killing his wife. His encounter with a prostitute sparks in him an explosive rage that leads to rape and murder. In this disturbing study of repression and obsession, Bergman contrasts stark black and white flashbacks with vivid color images that flood the screen with the horror of the present. ""Mogens Jensen, the psychiatrist in Mr. Bergman's film, fills his Munich office with statues of African deities, symbols of mystery and power, much as a tribal medicine man surrounds himself with ritualistic totems. He wears a white coat, like the priest's robe a vestment of authority. He is, in short, a magical god, believed by others to be capable of dispelling evil and restoring order. But what happens when this ""god"" is tested? When Peter, a friend of 20 years, confides - in the sanctity of the psychiatrist's office - that he has recurring dreams in which he murders his wife, the doctor makes light of an obviously grave problem. Soon it is apparent that the doctor, who shouldn't be ""treating"" a friend in the first place, has betrayed both his friendship and his profession by attempting to seduce Peter's wife. ""This comes under professional secrecy,"" he cautions her, and the suggestion is that there have been other such affairs in his office. When Peter finally commits a murder and totally withdraws into himself, the doctor's rationalizations show the doctor, too, to be only another puppet overwhelmed by life's ""hidden forces.""""

"Young Dr. Freud (Der junge Freud)(Austria | West Germany, TV, 1977)","Directed by Axel Corti. Cast: Karlheinz Hackl, Sylvia Haider, Brigitte Swoboda, Guido Wieland. From Freud's early childhood, where his family encounters aggressive anti-Semitism, to his student years in Vienna, this fact based film probes deeply into the personal and environmental influences on Freud as a young man, which led to the development of his psychoanalytical theories. It also explores Freud's relationships with famous colleagues, such as Breuer and Charcot, and the growth of his first book ""Studies in hysteria"". This film inverts the psychoanalytic model to place the analyst in the place of the analysand. 98 min.
