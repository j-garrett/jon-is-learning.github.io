Cast: Buster Keaton, Roscoe Arbuckle, Al St. John. Back Stage (1919): This film contains many of the routines Buster used in the ""Three Keatons"" stage act, and can rightly be called the first Keaton directed film. Good Night Nurse (1918): Arbuckle's surrealistic nightmare where he escapes the operating table, runs away and inadvertently enters a ""Great Heavyweight Race."" Arbuckle also gives his best ""in drag"" performance, playing a flirting nurse to Keaton's doctor. Coney Island (1918): Presents Roscoe's nephew, Al St. John, who does a series of ""tit-for-tats"" with Arbuckle to win a girl, only to have her end up with Buster Keaton. The Rough House (1918): Contains Arbuckle's famous ""roll dance,"" where at the breakfast table, he sticks two forks each into a separate roll and then uses them to do a parody of Charlie Chaplin's walk. Chaplin, appreciating the gag, later expanded on it for use in his film ""The Gold Rush."" Garage (1920): Presents Arbuckle and Keaton as a team who find various ways of destroying cars, how not to clean oil stains and how not to fight fires. Digitally remastered versions. 121 min.

Blacklisted by Hollywood, Arbuckle continued directing dozens of film comedies under the pseudonym ""William Goodrich"" for almost another decade. Each film features completely restored titles, intertitles, and several films include previously lost or alternate footage. Silent titles feature newly created scores.
