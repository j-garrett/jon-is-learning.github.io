"The Mills of the Gods: Viet Nam.","""As direct cinema evolved, so did its commitment to supporting social change. The Canadian Broadcasting Company did much to encourage and extend direct cinema's impact by creating television series devoted to direct cinema films engaging social issues. The most influential among these was the program ""This Hour Has Seven Days."" The Mills of the Gods, a shocking look at the early stages of the Vietnam War, was the show's most controversial and influential production. Beryl Fox, who had already established herself as a prolific filmmaker committed tosocial change in films such as Summer in Mississippi (1965) about American race relations, takes her camera to the Vietnam War to record the conflict and allows viewers to witness, first-hand, the sorrow, futility, and inhumanity at itscore. The film reveals the horrors of the war: the wide-scale destruction, thebrutal civilian casualties, and the torture of prisoners of war. These scenes are contrasted with quiet shots of everyday life in Vietnamese villages, and with candid interviews with enthusiastic American soldiers and pilots, who allseem to love their work. The films most shocking sequences come from filming with an American pilot on a bombing raid. The pilot is overjoyed at his successful napalm drop. Fox then takes her camera down to the village that was bombed, and shows us the horrific carnage the joyful pilot had caused. The Millsof the Gods caused both an immediate sensation and outrage when it was broadcast. The BBC aired the program, and the film circulated widely in the US, mainly on college campuses. The CBC had to run disclaimers before the film thatit did not present the viewpoint of the broadcaster. The US was so outraged that it basically blacklisted the CBC from any important news event in Washington, DC. The film caused diplomatic tensions to rise between Canada and the US, and led the Canadian government to pressure the CBC, which cancelled ""This Hour Has Seven Days"" in 1966. The Mills of the Gods is a perfect example of direct cinema's ability to go deeply into divisive issues and of the reaction of the establishment to its unconventional style of reporting events. Fox made two more acclaimed films about Vietnam (Saigon, 1967; Last Reflections on a War, 1968).The Mills of the Gods stands as one of the most important films on that tragic conflict.""
