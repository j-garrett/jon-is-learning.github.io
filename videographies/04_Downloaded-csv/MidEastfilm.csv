Alilo arrives in Paris, met by his hip cousin Mok. Alilo is to pick up a suitcase of dresses to smuggle back to Algiers for resale. He's lost the dressmaker's address and his boss is gone for five days, so he stays in the Moskova neighborhood of the 18th arrondissement with Mok. Mok makes rap music of Jean de La Fontaine's fables, invents fabrications of his own, is in debt to his bookie, and in love with a punk rocker. Alilo's old-country sweetness, in contrast with Mok's big-city neuroses, gets the attention of Fatoumata, a lovely African neighbor. Once Alilo gets the dresses, he must return to Algiers, but it seems he's only started to live: is there any way he can stay? 98 min. ; ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eDVD+X4758"">DVD X4758Ж, Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/evhs+999:3096"">vhs 999:3096Ж","â€¢149;Ѭ href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117544/"">Credits and other information from the Internet Movie DatabaseЖ

The adroit interweaving of various miniplots around the station is matched by a heady mix of moods and genres: at various junctures this movie becomes a musical, a slasher film, a neorealist drama, a comedy, and a horror film--come to think of it, it's pretty noir as well.""

Richly poetic and shot on a hand-held DV camera, the film features five extended, apparently single-take sequences. One: The camera accompanies a piece of wood with which the waves are toying at the beach. Two: People are walking along by the seaside. Older people stop, look at the waves, then walk away. Three: Indistinct shapes on a beach in winter. A group of dogs. A love story. Four: Ducks noisily cross the frame in one direction, then the other.

"Once Upon a Time Cinema (Ruzi Ruzagari, Cinema) (Iran, 1992)","Directed by Mohsen Makhmalbaf. A loving comedic homage to movies and moviemaking in Iran. It jumps around from the old silent days under the Shah to the current day, and makes fun of censorship rules. The leading character is known simply as ""Cinematographer,"" and characters appear in multiple roles onscreen in re-created films from previous eras, as well as in the story itself. In some cases, the screen characters leave the movie they are in and interact with real-life people. This antic comedy also screens clips from well-know Iranian films of the past. 100 min.

An independently-minded Iranian widow and mother flouts tradition by re-opening her late husband's Europe/Asia border café in this socially-oriented drama from director Kambozia Partovi. In the wake of her husband's death, Reyhan (Fereshtei Sadre Orafaei) longs to re-open her late spouse's café despite rigid social standards that explicitly discourage her from doing so. Isolated from her friends and neighbors for her headstrong efforts to get the business back on her feet, Reyhan also faces pressure from her conservative brother-in-law Nasser (Parviz Parastoei) -- who longs to take Reyhan as his second wife as permitted by custom. Despite Nasser's vengeful efforts to break Reyhan's spirit and put her out of business, Reyhan's culinary skills soon begin drawing a healthy clientèle that includes kindly Greek trucker Zakariyo (Nikolas Padapopoulis); whose relationship with the determined restaurateur may provide an exit from her current crisis 105 min.

Famously 'banned' for more than a year by Iranian authorities, this taboo-breaking film is based on Manijeh Hekmat's long fieldwork, among women prisoners in Iran. She depicts the lives of Iran's lost generation in the two decades since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, using the claustrophobic life of women behind bars as a metaphor for the entire society. Her protagonist, Mitra, is in prison for killing her violent stepfather. On the eve of a prison riot she confronts Tahereh, the new warden, whose dogmatic views she challenges fearlessly. Over the course of the next 20 years, Tahereh's attitude toward her prisoners changes and oftens, which reflects the country's shifting political stance. Eventually Mitra, aged and exhausted, is finally released, but Tahereh left behind, is now more like a prisoner herself. 106 min.

"[Aljafari, Kamal] The films of Kamal Aljafari","Contents: Port of memory (2009, 62 min.) -- The Roof (2006, 61 min.) -- Balconies (2009, 11 min.) -- Visit Iraq (2006, 26 min.). The haunting films of Kamal Aljafari mix documentary, fiction and personal memoir to render complex portraits of the Palestinian communities in Ramleh and Jaffa, now part of Israel. While providing a rare look at the everyday lives of Palestinian Israelis, the films are more than simply sociopolitical treatises of often-overlooked communities and neighborhoods in danger of dissolving. Aljafari instead astutely balances fiction and nonfiction to capture the fragile rhythms of lives lived in a kind of permanent displacement and the strange limbo of neighborhoods subtly yet inexorably transforming. Port of Memory : The history of the town of Jaffa, a thriving port city now part of Tel Aviv, provides the background for Aljafari's most recent film, centering on his mother's family at risk of eviction if they can't find proof that the house they have lived in for decades belongs to them. Their predicament is rendered with Aljafari's usual subtlety, as well as deadpan humor and dark wit. This skeletal narrative provides the scaffolding for a portrait of life in what was once a bustling neighborhood that was nearly emptied by fighting during the establishment of the state of Israel, and then suffered decades of official neglect. The Roof : This deceptively quiet film presents a portrait of Aljafari's family in Ramleh and Jaffa that hovers between documentary and cinematic memoir, guided by a nimble camera moving calmly but ceaselessly around the rooms of homes inhabited, damaged and ruined. The title refers to the roof missing from the house where Aljafari's family resettled in 1948, a home unfinished, an incomplete construction project. Balconies : An experimental meditation focusing on the deteriorating and unfinished balconies in Palestine. Visit Iraq : A humorous look at how Geneva residents imagine and project clichés on the recently abandoned office of Iraqi Airlines. 159 min.

"A History of Israeli Cinema","Weaves together clips from more than 70 years of Israeli film to give audiences a kaleidoscopic history of Israeli cinema, and by extension a history of the Jewish state. Part One spans 1933 to 1978, covering the early Zionist films that celebrated the struggle for nationhood. Part Two is devoted to 1978 to 2005, as filmmakers embrace the political and emotional reality of a country torn by ethnic and religious conflict. Includes interviews with noted film critics, actors and directors who talk about the role of cinema in a nation whose story is still being written.

"The Milky Way (Shvil Hahalav) (Israel, 1990)","Directed by Ali Nassar. A Richly compassionate chronicle of life in an Israeli occupied Arab village which is fiercely ruled by the Mukhtar, who fundamentally serves the interests of the Israeli military governor, instead of those of his own people. These are tough times for the villagers--some are bitter and spiteful--while others are weary of the power struggles. The narrative centers around such incidents as the military commander's discovery that one of the villagers is issuing work permits, and the killing of the Mukhtar's son. 104 min.

"Noodle (Israel, 2007)","Directed by Ayelet Menahemi. Cast: Mili Avital, BaoQi Chen, Alon Abutbul, Sinaya Ben-Dor, Yiftach Klein, Daphna Shpigelman. At thirty-seven, Miri is a twice-widowed, El Al flight attendant. Her well-regulated existence is suddenly turned upside down by an abandoned Chinese boy whose migrant-worker mother has been summarily deported from Israel. The film is a touching comic-drama in which two human beings -- as different from each other as Tel Aviv is from Beijing -- accompany each other on a remarkable journey, one that takes them both back to a meaningful life. 90 min.
