"Foresaken Fields","Before World War II, many Japanese-Americans had settled successfully as farmers in California. But when the war came, they were incarcerated under government orders and forced to sell their farms. When the war ended, many did not return to their rural homes, and those who did never recovered from the interruption in their lives. As their children moved away to college or jobs or to be with other families, there was a second forsaking of the fields. Japanese-American farming in California is a mere shadow of what it once was, yet it created the foundation for California agriculture as it is today. 2000. 27 min.

Surviving family members of the seventeen convicts, riot witnesses and members of the Sleepy Lagoon Defense Committee tell the story of the riots, which is highlighted by photographs of the riots, the trial and their participants.Originally broadcast as an episode of the television program The American Experience. 2002. 60 min.

"Berkeley in the Sixties.","A film by Mark Kitechell. Contents: Pt. 1 Confronting the university: the Free Speech Movement-- pt. 2. Confronting America: the anti-war movement (32 min.) -- pt. 3. Confronting history: the counter-culture movement(45 min.). Through interviews with participants and archival footage, presents a history of Berkeley, California in the 1960s. This film is a celebration and tribute to the spirited rebellion of the students of Berkeley in the 1960s. It romanticizes the past in some ways, but the participants, many of them just as dedicated to causes as they were as youths at Berkeley offer realistic and honest remembrances from those hectic days. The film is in three distinct segments: Part I -- Confronting the University. The demonstrations began simply with students protesting the appearance of the House Un-American Activities Committee on campus to investigate communist appearances as speakers. It was the beginning of Speaker Ban. It tells of the creation of the student activist group known as SLATE, and the increasing confrontations with the University administration then led by W. Clark Kerr. 41 minutes. Part II -- Confronting America. Largely about the efforts to carry their activism beyond the campus and the narrow environment of Berkeley and Oakland. The issues of Civil Rights and Free Speech soon give way to protest against the war in a place called Vietnam. 31 minutes. Part III -- Confronting History. The emergence of the counter-culture in neighboring San Francisco, and the politicization of blacks as represented by Stokeley Carmichael and more especially the activities of Huey Newton and Bobby Seale and the Black Panthers creates a new environment for many of the people in this movement. Suddenly differences in perspective and scope of activism change. 44 minutes. Notes: Edited by Veronica Selves. Photographed by Stephen Lighthill. Narrated by Susan Griffin. Written by Griffin, Kitchell, and Stephen Most. Among those interviewed are: Frank Bardacke, Jentri Anders, John Gage, Jack Weinberg, Michael Rossman, Bobby Seale, David Hilliard, Ruth Rosen, Suzy Nelson, Barry Melton, John Searle, Mike Miller, Hardy Fry and Susan Griffin. Songs heard on the track include They All Sang Bread And Roses, Fortunate Son (Creedence Clearwater Revival), The Weight (The Band) The Revolution Will Not Be Televised (Gil Scott Heron) and The Jefferson Airplane's Embryonic Journey. 1990. 117 min.

"Freemont, U.S.A.","Fremont, California is a city transformed by new immigration. A rajagopuram rises in a tidy suburban neighborhood, announcing the vital presence of the Hindu community. The diversity of the global Buddhist community is also in evidence, as Thai, Chinese and Burmese temples -- and a women's monastic retreat center -- dot the landscape.

After Alia Ansari, a Muslim woman, is murdered on a Fremont street while walking her young daughter to school, some wonder if it is a hate crime.

"VDL Research House: Richard Neutra's Studio and Residence","The VDL Research House was designed by architect Richard Neutra in 1932 and served as his studio and residence for the rest of his career. Uniquely among his projects, it represented the three major phases of his aesthetic development. It exemplified his early works, which featured compact volumes in white or silver, with thin surfaces and bands of windows. The Garden house built behind the VDL house in 1939 shows an emphasis on indoor/outdoor living, with its large windows and deep overhangs, typical of his work in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The original house was destroyed by fire in 1963 and rebuilt in 1966. Neutra's post-war work reflected his interest in environmental design, seen in the VDL House II with its use of site and climate responsive features. Special features: 40 min. documentary film on VDL I & II; additional interviews with Lauren Weiss Bricker, Director, Archives/Special Collections at Caifornia State Polytechnic University, Pomona, College of Environmental Design, and Judith Sheine, Chair of Architecture; Appearances by Neutra's sons Dion and Raymond, historian Thomas Hines and Neutra associate John Blanton; Includes an interactive tour featuring photographs, drawings and virtual reality panoramas for 360Â° viewing; Includes archive of original VDL I & II construction drawings and Neutra's travel sketches; historical photographs by Julius Shulman.
