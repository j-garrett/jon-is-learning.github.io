Cast: Kevin Spacey, Paul Bettany, Jeremy Irons, Zachary Quinto, Penn Badgley, Simon Baker, Mary McDonnell, Demi Moore, Stanley Tucci, Aasif Mandvi, Ashley Williams, Susan Blackwell, Maria Dizzia. Who cares about the suffering--existential, financial, or other--of those who blindly mismanaged our monies into this ever-expanding, verily bottomless pit of debt? No one, but this drama may help viewers understand A) the birth of current financial woes, and B) what it might have been like, in those first few hours within the confines of an early investment trading firm casualty. Fueled by a mass layoff, a thumb drive, and a rocket-scientist-cum-analyst who really understands the numbers, the last night of good times on Wall Street unfolds as rung by rung, up the executive ladder, travels news that is -- apocalyptic. For viewers who still have no idea of how 2008's meltdown happened, this film is one fiction that will make it ever so much more real. Special features: Director and producer feature commentary [optional audio]; Deleted scenes [with optional commentary] (5 min.); Revolving door: Making ""Margin Call"" (6 min.); Missed calls: Moments with cast & crew (1 min.); From the deck: photo gallery [slide show] (4 min.); Also from Lionsgate (8 min.). 107 min.

As his family grows suspicious of his evasive behavior, Vincent is forced to spin a new tale, pretending to get a job working for the U.N. In a bid to keep the money coming in, he recruits old friends to invest in an imaginary emerging-markets investment scheme. Vincent also falls in with Jean-Michel, a black market dealer whose ignominious past serves as an ominous warning for Vincent's present course.

"While the City Sleeps (1956)","Directed by Fritz Lang. Cast: Dana Andrews, Rhonda Fleming, George Sanders, Howard Duff, Thomas Mitchell, Vincent Price, John Barrymore, Jr., Sally Forrest, James Craig, Ida Lupino. ""Bedridden Amos Kyne is owner and manager of media conglomerate Kyne Enterprises. Upon Amos' death, his son, the ineffective Walter Kyne, takes control of the business. Not wanting to do any of the work but retain the glory, Walter creates a new position - Executive Director - that person who effectively will become head of the organization. The heads of the three primary arms of the business - John Day Griffith (newspaper), Mark Loving (wire service) and Harry Kritzer (photographic service) - are those in line for the job, each who will do whatever he needs to for the appointment. Walter has decided that whoever of the three solves and reports the Lipstick Killings first will get the position. The Lipstick Killings are the murders of young women, the murderer who scrawls a note in lipstick at the murder scene after the fact. Pulitzer Prize winning author and reporter Edward Mobley is seen by most to be the real brains of the organization, although he has no desire for the top job. Although he initially will not get into the internal fight for the job, Ed, who has connections to the police department and has his own thoughts as to the psychological profile of the killer, decides to assist his old friend, John Griffith, in solving the case. In their quest, those involved do not hesitate to use the women in their lives - namely Nancy Liggett (Ed's fiancâ€¢233;e and Mark's secretary), Dorothy Kyne (Walter's wife), and Women's Affairs columnist Mildred Donner - in whatever manner they can.""
