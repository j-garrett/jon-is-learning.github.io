Fact-based story about the 40 passengers and crew aboard San Francisco bound flight United 93, who sat down as strangers and found the courage to stand up as one. This hijacked flight was the fourth terrorist attack plane on September 11, 2001. As a result of a delay on takeoff, the passengers on the flight, are behind the carefully scheduled planned attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Once hijacked, the passengers and crew are able to discern that this is no mere hijacking. While the real events that caused the ultimate crash of the plane can never be known, the events depicted would appear to be as might be expected. The scariest part of the film is the unpreparedness of the FAA and the military in dealing with the situation. 111 min.
