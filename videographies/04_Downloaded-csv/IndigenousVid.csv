"Kennewick Man: An Epic Drama of the West","When a human skull was found by the Columbia River near Kennewick, Washington in 1996, it turned out to be one of the oldest and most complete skeletons ever found in North America, igniting a firestorm of controversy pitting scientists against Native Americans. The scientists demanded the right to study the bones, while the Umatilla Tribe believed the bones to be sacred and ancestral. When the American government ruled the bones would be repatriated, eight scientists then filed a lawsuit in order to block the action. This documentary explores the cultural assumptions and differing opinions among the various groups involved, looks at the far-reaching implications for the future of anthropology and present-day relations between Native and non-native people. 2001. 86 min.

Native and other bodies: Addresses the track record of NAGPRA (Native American Grave Protection and Repatriation Act) and also looks at objects other than human remains as a kind of ""cultural body,"" thus looking at NAGPRA as an internally consistent whole.
Native American remains and human rights: Despite the passage of NAGPRA Native Americans are still being confronted by scientists claiming a right to own or control dead Indian bodies in order to conduct experiments on them perpetuating a double standard which began with early North American exploration that treated Indian bodies as property, curios or archaeological artificts while dead bodies and graves of other citizens were protected by laws.
Human remains and NAGPRA: The chief archaeologist of the National Park Service explains the procedures and requirements of NAGPRA that requires the repatriation of Native American human remains and other cultural objects in public museum collections and those recovered from federal lands.
Bone courts and Native American sovereignty: Considers a proposal to establish a Bone Court -- a new federal judicial forum to hear and decide disputes over museum collections of human remains, repatriation, burial sites, research on bones and to protect native sovereignty. 180 min.

Panel: Joseph Myers (Introductions), William Johnson (Moderator), James C. Chatters, Orin Starn, Ira Jacknis, Karl Kroeber, Karen Biestman (Discussant).
Kennewick Man: NAGPRA was intended to return the remains of recent Native American dead to their nearest of kin but was not intended to hand over ancient human fossils to modern-day Indian tribes, yet that is how it is being interpreted by some. Much of the scientific community and American public feels ancient remains, which often cannot be linked to modern tribes, should not be summarily reburied for temporal political reasons. This talk addresses this conflict which came to a head with the case of the Kennewick Man, a ca. 9,500 year old skeleton.
History and repatriation of Ishi: A small group from the Pit River Tribe held a private ceremony last month to rebury Ishi, the last Yahi Indian. This paper offers one view of the campaign to repatriate Ishi and what it can tell us about anthropology, Native America, and the politics of memory and identity.
From performance to record: Ishi's music and speech: Between 1911 to 1914, T. T. Waterman and Alfred Kroeber recorded Ishi, his music and narration of stories. This talk examines the preservation of these recordings and their content.
Humanity of Ishi: Historical evaluation of Ishi's behavior challenges judgments that reduce his role to that of passive victim. Such reduction in fact is an inverse expression of the cliche of the ""noble savage,"" and diminishes understanding of and respect for the unique individuality of Ishi's impressiveness as a human being. 153 min.

Invaders is what the white men were to the natives, who liked the trinkets they were given and had no inkling what they would have to give in return---their lands, their gods, their lives. The survivors have been turned into exotic objects by Hollywood, television, and tourism. As a modern-day analogue of white exploration and settlements centuries ago, this film tells of the Panara of Brazil, whose first contact with whites came in 1971.

Schools, where native children find it nearly impossible to balance the white view they are taught with the language and values they learn at home, represent a major problem for native children. Various tribes have responded differently to the challenge of educating their children: the Seminole of Florida resist being integrated, the Miccosukee decided not to fight but to join, and the Cree took back their own schools.

The battle for the southern Plains: The southern Plains & the Comanche ; Council house fight & the Texas Rangers ; Chief Buffalo Hump's war ; First battle of Adobe Walls & the Kiowa chiefs ; The Red River War ; The desert southwest ; Cochise & the Apache guerillas ; From the Spanish conquistadors of the 16th century to the English colonists of the 18th, the settling of America often came at the cost of Native American blood.

This extensive documentary chronicles the Indian Wars of 1540 to 1890 through archival photographs and voiceover narration, covering pivotal battles such as Tippecanoe, Horseshoe Bend, Little Big Horn, and Wounded Knee, as well as the famous men who fought them, including Tecumseh, Crazy Horse, Geronimo, Sitting Bull, Wild Bill Hickok, Kit Carson, and George Custer. c2005. 222 min.

As the 20th century neared, Americans celebrated with the World Columbian Exposition, where they were told that the frontier had closed, but in the real West, for every frontier story that ended, another one began. Some Native Americans waged a struggle to hold onto their traditions in the midst of rapid, overwhelming change, while others chose to learn the white man's ways, hoping to help their families and their tribe. In California, the emerging metropolis of Los Angeles waged yet another battle to control the arid region's most precious commodity--water. Much had changed in the West, but it continued to be what it had always been--a landscape of the imagination, the reservoir of our shared hopes and dreams, a place of both conflict and infinite possibility, and an enduring symbol of something unquestionably American. 65 min.

"American Outrage","""Two feisty Western Shoshone sisters put up a heroic fight for their land rights - and their human rights. Carrie and Mary Dann endure terrifying roundups by armed federal marshals in which thousands of their horses and cattle are confiscated, for the crime of grazing them on the open range outside their private ranch - even though that range is part of 60 million acres recognized as Western Shoshone land by the U.S. After the government sued them for trespassing, their dispute went to the Supreme Court, and eventually the United Nations. Why has the U.S. spent millions persecuting and prosecuting two elderly women grazing a few hundred horses and cows in a desolate desert? The Dann sisters say the real reason is the resources hidden beneath this seemingly barren land, their Mother Earth: it is the second largest gold producing area in the world. This eloquent testament to the courage of the Dann sisters is an important document for those who want to understand the ongoing resistance of Native peoples to U.S. colonialism in Indian country.""

"Buffalo Dance(1894)","""In the year of 1872, former soldier and frontiersman ""Buffalo"" Bill Cody decided to enter show business by creating a traveling company dedicated to perform little plays based on his very own adventures while living in the wild west. 11 years later, in 1883, what started as a little company would become the ""Buffalo Bill's Wild West"" show, an enormous spectacle conceived as a Western-themed circus where Buffalo Bill and company would perform many stunts or shows and bring the experience of the Wild West to the East. Soon Buffalo Bill's show became the most popular attraction of the 19th Century and so, in 1894, members of his show were invited to Thomas Alva Edison's ""Black Maria"" in order to participate in the making of Kinetoscope films about the show. The legendary ""Buffalo Bill's Wild West"" show was now part of cinema history. ""Buffalo Dance"" is one of several movies done by members of Buffalo Bill's show in those days. What makes this one stand out is that its one of the two (along ""Sioux Ghost Dance"") done about the Native Americans of the show, as the shooting of the two films (on September 24, 1894) represents the first time Native Americans appeared on film. As the title implies, this movie shows three Sioux Indians performing the ""Buffalo Dance"", while two others appear in the background playing the music with their drums. The Buffalo dance seems to be more ancient than the ritual Ghost Dance, and this movie captures it in a very good and detailed way, making it an invaluable source about Native Americans in that period .""

"Sioux Ghost Dance(1894)","""While much of the print of this feature has deteriorated badly, and while the footage itself may strike many present-day viewers as simply emphasizing stereotyped portrayals of Native Americans, it is still of some interest as an example of early studio practices. It was one of a number of features that the Edison Company filmed at around the same time using performers from the Buffalo Bill Wild West exhibition, but this one in particular was made not for domestic viewing, but rather for European distribution. The Edison Company was always on the lookout for money-making and money-saving ideas, and many of their early features were financed by potential distributors, at little or no cost to Edison. According to film historian Charles Musser (in an interview accompanying Kino's DVD collection of Edison films), this particular movie was one such example, having been made as part of promoting the Wild West's upcoming tour of Europe. The footage itself is not especially impressive, in large part because of damage done to the film over time. It does apparently use genuine members of the Sioux tribe, and in viewing it, it should also be remembered that the constraints of filming inside the Edison Company's 'Black Maria' studio almost certainly hindered the dancers' ability to do the dance on its usual scale. As a result, they seem to be unnaturally scrunched together for most of the running time. In any case, the fascination with the 'wild west', its myths, and its figures seems to have been at least as strong in Europe as it was in the USA, and this brief movie is one illustration of that. It is also one of many illustrations of the competitive business practices of the earliest film-makers - there seems never to have been a time when movie-making was not a serious business to some.""

Two families leave for the hunt, while the old couple waits by the shore for their return... Saputi: As summer ends near Igloolik in the 1930's, three families build a saputi to trap fish going upriver for the winter. The days are getting shorter and young people daydream while waiting for the fish to come. But nature is not always predictable...
