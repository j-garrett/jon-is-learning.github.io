It continues with an animated presentation about mankind seeking to understand the world in which he lives, first noticing patterns in the stars, and developing certain beliefs regarding the celestial bodies. Theories from scientists and philosophers are discussed, including Ptolemy's inaccurate, but formerly-accepted theories, as well as those of Copernicus. Life on other planets is considered, soon focusing on Mars. Ideas from science-fiction authors H.G. Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs are brought to life with more colorful animation.

"Our Friend the Atom.(1958)","Directed by Hamilton Luske; Walt Disney Studios. ""Our Friend The Atom...was produced by Disney in cooperation with the U.S. Navy and General Dynamics, builders of the nuclear submarine USS Nautilus. As a ""Tomorrowland"" segment of the Disneyland television show, Our Friend The Atom relates the history of atomic energy, beginning with a clip from the earlier film 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, which erroneously maintains that author Jules Verne predicted the use of atomic energy. The film then progresses to an animated fairy tale of a fisherman who finds a bronze bottle in his net. Opening the flask, the fisherman is confronted by a genie, who explains that after centuries of confinement, he has resolved to kill whomever opens the bottle. The fisherman feigns surprise that so large a being could fit into the bottle. The genie returns to the vessel to prove that it can be done, and the wily fisherman corks the bottle up. Finally, the genie relents and promises to grant the fisherman his wishes if the bottle is uncorked. Says the narrator, ""The story of the atom is like this fable, come true through science. For centuries we have been casting our nets into the sea of the great unknown in search of knowledge. Finally, we found a vessel and, like the one in the fable, it contains the genie."" In a combination of live-action and animation, Our Friend The Atom moves from this fairy tale premise to an international history of atomic energy that culminates in American control of the technology. To soothe public apprehension, atomic energy is explained in terms of common household items. An atomic reactor, the viewer is told, is just like a big furnace. An atomic chain reaction is likened to what happens when a stray ping-pong ball is thrown at a mass of mousetraps with ping-pong balls set on each one. The narrator relates that an atomic explosion might be like the angry genie, but with the nuclear reactor and the magic power to transmute ordinary materials into radioactive tools in science and medicine, ""Here lies our chance to make the atomic genie our friend."" The film ends with the prediction that ""clean"" nuclear reactors will replace grimy coal and oil power plants. Radiation will be used to produce better crops and livestock. People will zoom from place to place in atomic cars, trains, boats and planes. ""Then, the atom will become truly our friend."""" [From: Langer, Mark. ""Disney's Atomic Fleet.""

All but one, that is: poor little Robespierre. She doesn't notice until after the rest of the brood has gone swimming and Robespierre has sprouted legs and run off in search of warmth. He finds it, under a hibernating bear (""So I laid an egg""), but a wolf has followed him in and snatches the egg, with some help from a stick of TNT. What the wolf hasn't counted on is mama, who's right behind him, with a couple of eye-poking fingers at the ready. The wolf swaps a doorknob for the egg, and starts boiling the egg, but mama arrives in the nick of time only to be rejected by the baby, who was just getting warm.

"Merrie Melodies is the name of a series of animated cartoons distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures between 1931 and 1969. The sister series to Warner's Looney Tunes, Merrie Melodies were originally one-shot musical cartoon shorts before gradually featuring recurring characters. By 1944, no distinctions existed between the two series. [Ѭ href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrie_Melodies"">WikipediaЖ] Originally produced by Harman-Ising Pictures, Merrie Melodies were produced by Leon Schlesinger Productions from 1933 to 1944. Schlesinger sold his studio to Warner Bros. in 1944, and the newly renamed Warner Bros. Cartoons continued production until 1963. Merrie Melodies were outsourced to DePatie-Freleng Enterprises from 1964 to 1967, and Warner Bros. Animation (now owned by Warner Bros.-Seven Arts) re-assumed production for the series' final two years.","Warner BrothersЖ"

The door slams open and Birdon nearly falls out of it. He seems afraid of freedom at first, but then he gets a hold of himself and takes a flight through the skies.

Features 10 animated films by master Italian animator Bruno Bozzetto who tackles complex societal issues in short, witty, and wildly inventive animated episodes. Baby story: The miracle of procreation observed from within the woman's body. Sigmund: Requested for the Los Angeles Olympics back in 1984, this animated short shows the side effects that the television can cause on a very young viewer. Grasshoppers: View of world history and the part violence has played in that history with a humorous warning that grasshoppers might outlast us all. Academy Award nominee. Striptease: A very amusing spot created for a German TV programme dedicated to eroticism. Self service: Just like we exploit earth by extracting oil, so do mosquitoes behave over the human body by sucking our blood. A life in a tin: By restraining the whole cycle of life into just six minutes, the film underlines how our constant commitments often mislead us from the real meaning of life. Big bang: The consumption civilization regularly churns out a huge amount of wastes. How and where to dispose of them? Here comes a possible solution to the problem with its inevitable aftermath. Dancing: Optimism and a peaceful view of life can defeat even the biggest adversities. This one is the infallible formula employed by the film's protagonist to face the most cruel and merciless enemy of mankind. Baeus: An insect falls head over heels in love with a woman and he will do everything to cry out his love to her. Mister Tao: The peak of a mountain is generally just a destination and the end of a trip. For tiny peaceful Mister Tao, on the other hand it simply stands for a temporary stopover before he continues his research which may never come to an end.

"The Colonial Friend (L'ami y'a bon)(Germany / France, 2005)","Directed by Rachid Bouchareb. ""Rachid Bouchareb's indelible and haunting short film The Colonial Friend is a muted, yet thoughtful and compelling true historical account of the 1944 massacre by the French army of indigenous African soldiers who sought to collect wages for their military service. Centered on a Cameroonian farmer, Abi, who, like many able-bodied indigenous men from colonized territories, leaves his family to heed the patriotic call for conscription into the French armed forces during the early 1940s as part of the nation's war campaign against the Germans, he serves with distinction during the war, fighting - and often dying - alongside French and colonized soldiers in the battlefield until he is captured and interned when France falls into the hands of the Germans. Eventually repatriated at the end of the war, Abi briefly returns to his family before rejoining his fellow Senegalese veterans to demand their unpaid wages at Camp de Thiaroye, a peaceful protest that soon turns deadly when the French army turns its armaments towards its own soldiers to force their evacuation from the military installation. Elegantly (and incisively) rendered in two-tone (black and red), pencil sketch animation, Bouchareb understatedly, but effectively presents a pervasive image of subtle, yet omnipresent division and differentiation that continues to surface despite the perpetuated myth of colonial assimilation and enlightened occupation.""

"Felix the CatЖ (Otto Messmer) Ѭ href=""felix"">Ж","Felix the Cat","Created by Otto Messmer. ""The first animated character that attained superstar status (and was anthropomorphic) during the silent era was the mischievous Felix the Cat, in Pat Sullivan Studios. He was inspired by Kipling's The Cat That Walked By Himself in the Just So Stories published in 1902. Originated by young animator Otto Messmer, the (unnamed) cat's first two cartoons were the five-minute Feline Follies (1919) and Musical Mews (1919), when Felix was known only as ""Master Tom."" Feline Follies was a segment of the Paramount Magazine, a semi-weekly compilation of short film segments that included animated cartoons. By the third Felix cartoon, The Adventures of Felix (1919), Felix took his permanent name. For the first few years, the Felix cartoons were distributed by Paramount Pictures, and then by M.J. Winkler. Messmer directed and animated more than 175 Felix cartoons in the years 1919 through 1929. Felix was the first character to be widely merchandised. The last Felix the Cat cartoon, The Last Life (1928), was due to the advent of the talkies and the success of Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse.

"[Harryhausen, Ray]","""Before the advent of computers for camera motion control and CGI, movies used a variety of approaches to achieve animated special effects. One approach was one of the many kinds of stop-motion animation which used realistic miniature models (more accurately called model animation), used famously in King Kong (1933). The work of pioneer model animator Willis O'Brien in King Kong inspired Harryhausen to work in this unique field, almost single-handedly keeping the technique alive for three decades as O'Brien's career sadly floundered for most of his life, until his death in 1962. Harryhausen prefers not to compare his work with special effects animation in live action films to the animated films of Tim Burton, Nick Park, Ivo Caprino, Ladislav Starevich and many others, which he sees as pure ""puppet films"", and are more accurately (and traditionally) called ""puppet animation"". Model animated characters interact with, and are a part of, the live-action world, with the idea that they will cease to call attention to themselves as ""animation"", which is different from the more obviously ""cartoony"" and stylized designs in movies like Chicken Run and The Nightmare Before Christmas, etc. Springing from O'Brien's groundbreaking work, Harryhausen continued bringing stop-motion into the realm of live action movies, keeping alive and refining the techniques created by O'Brien that he had first developed as early as 1917.""

The hated rivals fight, and Steve wins when he throws The Duke into a pot of boiling water. A title card introduces a third rival, ""our unassuming hero, Theophilus Ivoryhead."" Miss Rockface invites the three men into her father's drawing room/cave, apologizing for not offering tea, since it has not been discovered yet. The Duke and Steve fight again, and everyone rushes out of the cave. Mr. Rockface notices his pot of food is empty; earlier, Wild Willie the Missing Link had eaten it. Mr. Rockface tells the three suitors they will have to procure their own dinner. Steve locates a desert quail and shoots an arrow at it, but the arrow misses the quail and happily (for Steve) hits The Duke's behind. Meanwhile, Wild Willie is still hungry and goes hunting for snakes. He finds a dinosaur's tail instead, and when he tries to eat it the dinosaur kills him. Luckily, Theophilus witnesses this scene; after the dinosaur leaves he stands on the dead monkey-man, as if triumphant. The others arrive and are shocked that Theophilus apparently has slain the terror of the countryside.

"The Fifth-column Mouse (1942)","Directed by Friz Freleng. Animated short. ""In this parable for the failure of appeasement before World War II, house mice are targeted by a hungry cat, who intrudes upon their idyllic life. When all but one of the mice successfully take refuge in a wall hole, the cat promises to the one mouse who didn't manage to escape, that he won't hurt anyone, provided he's placated with pampering by every mouse in the pack. Acting as the cat's quisling, the mouse speaks to his rodent brothers, telling them to appease the cat, to give the cat all the comforts he wants, and in turn the cat will live in peace with them. The mice are wary of the cat but agree to his terms. Not surprisingly, the cat's appetite isn't assuaged, and he soon craves a mouse dinner.

He fights off the crew, using them to punch a ""V"" in the side of the ship, then opens it like a sardine can. At the end, he tows the captured crew in a giant birdcage made out of the scrap boats.
