"Picadilly (UK, 1929)","Direced by E.A. Dupont. Cast: Anna Mae Wong, Jameson Thomas, Gilda Gray, Charles Laughton, Cyril Ritchard, Hannah Jones. ""Just before making his talkie directorial debut with Atlantic, director E.A. DuPont dashed off the silent ""backstage"" drama Piccadilly. By the time the film was released in 1929, talking pictures had taken a firm hold of the British film industry, obliging DuPont to reshoot much of the picture with dialogue. American screen favorites Anna May Wong and Gilda Gray (the girl who popularized the ""shimmy dance"") head the cast, the former as Shosho, a dishwasher in the London nightclub where the latter, cast as dancer Mabel Greenfield, performs nightly. Jealous of Mabel's dancing partner Victor Smiles (Cyril Ritchard), club owner Wilmot (Jameson Thomas) fires Victor, whereupon business drops off dramatically. In desperation, Wilmot takes Shosho out of the kitchen and puts her on stage, where she scores a big success. Feeling threatened by Shosho, Mabel heads to her rival's apartment with blood in her eye. A shot rings out, Shosho falls dead, and Mabel is accused of murder. But during the trial, it turns out that Shosho was done in by her Chinese sweetheart Jim (Kim Ho Chang). In his first feature film appearance, Charles Laughton performs an outrageous bit as a rowdy night club patron; also seen in a minuscule role is young Ray Milland. The talkie version of Piccadilly wasn't released in the U.S. until 1932."" (Hal Erickson, Ѭ href=""http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:128199"">All Movie GuideЖ) 109 min.

"Sink the Bismark! (UK, 1960)","Director: Lewis Gilbert. Cast: Kenneth More, Dana Wynter, Carl Mohner, Laurence Naismith, Karel Stepanek, Maurice Denham, Mark Dignam, Michael Goodliffe, Jack Gwillam, Michael Hordern, Geoffrey Keen, Esmond Knight, Jack Watling, Edward R. Murrow. The Bismarck was the fabled German battleship of World War II. Traces the ""life"" of the Bismarck from its launching (courtesy of newsreel footage) through its many battles and narrow escapes, concluding with its far-from-inevitable sinking in the Spring of 1941. The story concentrates on the human element, specifically a British intelligence captain, who has lost his family in the London blitz and thus has a personal reason for seeing the Bismarck blasted from the sea. The captain's tireless efforts are abetted by the love and support of a female naval officer. Based on the book by C.S. Forester. 97 min.

"The Caretaker (aka The Guest) (UK, 1963)","Directed by Clive Donner. Screenplay by Harold Pinter. Cast: Alan Bates, Donald Pleasence, Robert Shaw. Mick and Aston are brothers. Mick is a builder, drives a van, and is often away. Aston is a quiet, reserved man, who lives alone in a cluttered room on the top-floor of a small house Mick owns in a poor London district. Aston rescues an old derelict named Mac Davies from a possible beating, and invites him to the flat. In the course of the mind games and power struggles that play out between the two brothers, all three men reveal how they have been damaged by life, which helps to explain the constant verbal damage they do to each other. But it becomes very clear that while they all have dreams--which they are unlikely to fulfill--they are merely going through the motions of life, deceiving themselves.

""St. Sebastiane was an obscure Roman mystic who might barely be remembered today were it not for the homoerotic rumors which have persistently clung to him. In Sebastiane, directors Derek Jarman and Paul Humfress bring all the implied into the foreground, creating the frankly homosexual world of their St. Sebastiane. In the process they have pulled off an amazing trick. They have made a beautiful film which evokes a realistic feeling of another place and time, explores the dual nature of spirituality and sexuality, and also depicts an ultimate homosexual fantasy.""

Writer Roy Minton approached Alan Clarke to have his social commentary screenplay remade as a feature film consisting of a largely unknown cast.

Upon arrival he finds a brutal authoritarian system completely uninterested in reforming any of the young charges; equally treacherous is the inmate hierarchy which he must learn to navigate. Carlin quickly ascends to the role of 'Daddy' or top dog, but not at a small price. Unfortunately others are not so savvy and fall afoul of the social system, leading to beatings, a brutal rape, a bloody suicide, and a vicious climactic revolt. 98 min.

Amin's despotic reign of terror is viewed through the eyes of Nicholas Garrigan, a Scottish doctor who arrives in Uganda in the early 1970s to serve as Amin's personal physician. His perspective as an outsider causes him to be initially impressed by Amin's calculated rise to power and he grows increasingly monstrous.

"The Queen (UK / France / Italy, 2006)","Directed by Stephen Frears. Cast: Helen Mirren (HM Queen Elizabeth II), Michael Sheen (Tony Blair), James Cromwell (Prince Philip), Helen McCrory (Cherie Blair), Alex Jennings (Prince Charles), Roger Allam (Robin Janvrin), and Sylvia Syms (HM The Queen Mother). The Queen opens with a familiar epigraph ""Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown"" - Henry IV, Part II. The action of the film takes place during the week following the death, on August 31, 1997 of Diana, Princess of Wales. One of its accomplishments, courtesy of the adroit use of newsreel and other contemporary footage, is to remind viewers of the deep sadness that surrounded that event. It is also about the divergent and potentially ruinous ways the monarch and Prime Minister Tony Blair responded to the resulting torrent of national grief. Special features: The Making Of ...
