"[Fodor's] Hamlet (2007)","Director Alexander Fodor. Cast: Tallulah Sheffield, Jason Wing, Lydia Piechowiak, Katie Reddin-Clancey, Simon Nader, Di Sherlock, Alan Hanson, Wilson Belchambers, James Frail. Fodor's production is not a film in the traditional sense, but rather a series of photographs supported by text. Told as a nightmarish ghost story while never changing the original lines, this production uses sounds, light and camera to produce a more natural experience of Hamlet. 220 min.

Cast: Joshua Forcum (Lear), Charlotte McIvor (Prudentia), Elizabeth Granzow (Clarissa), Aaron Brownstein, Brady M. Woolery, Alicia Bruckman, Leah Dashe, Cherie Rice, Scott Smith. Shakespeare described the seven ages of man, but modern playwright Howard Barker is the first to apply that formula to King Lear. Barker's Seven Lears, the Pursuit of the Good, explores his backstory, asking what he was like as a mere princeling, how he become king, how good a king he was, and where was Queen Lear, and why did his own daughter hate him. 2006. 180 min.

"Shake Me, Mr. Shakespeare(1936)","Directed by Roy Mack. ...Satire on Hollywood adapting Shakespeare to suit its own vaudeville sensibility comes in the form of a dream by a producer while he sleeps at his desk. The books representing complete works of Shakespeare soon see their characters step literally from the pages and argue, sing dance and interact (Henry 5th goes to Rome to see Julius Caesar etc) all to swing music and backstage antic characters overlaying The bard's thesps as written. This is the ""SpringTime For Hitler"" of 1936. Juliet does a torch song number plaintively bleating from her balcony about ""Ro-me-o where's my Ro-me-o"" in the Lullabye of Broadway style. As a satire on the illiterate corporate minds who mangle literature and feed it to the masses as showgirl or western or mawkish studio output, Shake Mr Shakespeare is a truly inspired in- house Warner Bros success. My favorite bit? the team of Tapdancing Hamlets, all in tune tapping and swingin away on the headstones in the graveyard."" [Ѭ href=""http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0409286/#comment"">IMDBЖ] 20 min.
