On the edge of a rocky desolate Mexican border town is a makeshift bar and brothel called ""Las Mujeres de Troya,"" whose only patrons are soldiers from the other side. Doña Hecuba, the bar's proprietress, routinely overlooks the preparations for the night shift. But this evening fate intervenes in the form of Agamemnon, a powerful General from across the border, who has sent for Doña Hecuba's uncorrupted, enigmatic daughter, Cassandra. Doña Hecuba's desperate pleas are powerless against Cassandra's mysterious and fateful volition, which compels her to submit to Agamemnon. Her decision to cross the border takes us beyond the barriers of the flesh to the very limits of perception. Based on Euripides' ""The Trojan Women"". 28 min.
