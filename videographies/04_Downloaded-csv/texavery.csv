"All This and Rabbit Stew (1941)","Another dumb hunter decides to make Bugs Bunny his dinner. Singing ""Ah'm gonna ketch me a rah-hah-habit,"" the slow-witted little black boy (complete with coal-black skin, big red blubbery lips, excessively large feet and a lazy sing-song voice) sees rabbit tracks: ""Well, shut mah mouth- rabbit tracks!"" He finds Bugs' hole, into which he sticks his gun barrel (in a manner akin to Elmer Fudd): ""OK, Mr. Rabbit, I'se got you covered- now put up those hands or else I'll blitzkrieg ya!!"" After several typically clever gags, Bugs shakes some dice in his fist, the kid's eyes moving up and down with Bugs' hand. ""Whatchoo got there, man? It couldn't be a pair of them?"" They gamble until Bugs has literally won all of the kid's clothes off his back! Walking away, dressed in the kid's overalls and dragging the rifle behind them, a triumphant-looking Bugs mocks the wannabe hunter with: ""I'm gonna catch me a wah-hah-habit."" The hunter kid stands with only a fig leaf covering his... you know. He says, ""Well, shut my mouth and call me Adam."" Before the ""iris"" closes on the naked hunter, a smiling Bugs grabs the fig leaf off the kid and proudly holds it aloft.
