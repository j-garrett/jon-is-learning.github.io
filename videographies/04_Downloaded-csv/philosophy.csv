"Being in the World","Ten years after graduating with a degree in philosophy from UC Berkeley, filmmaker Tao Ruspoli returned to visit his one-time professor, world-renowned philosopher Herbert Dreyfus. That visit led to meetings with a whole generation of philosophers whom Dreyfus had taught, which subsequently sparked the inspiration for this film. Being in the World raises the question of whether we have forgotten what it means to be truly human in today's technological age, and proceeds to answer this question by taking a journey around the world to meet a whole host of remarkable individuals, including Manuel Molina, the legendary poet and flamenco master; Leah Chase, affectionately known as the Queen of Creole Cuisine; and Hiroshi Sakaguchi, a master carpenter from Japan. By showing how these modern day masters approach life from within their chosen fields, Ruspoli's film celebrates the ability of human beings to find meaning in the world through the mastery of physical, intellectual, and creative skills.

Going beyond the Lacanian Real, this film examines those real elements (which may or may not resist symbolization) that constitute the nodal points of our worldly existence -- the points that undermine all systematic attempts to determine this existence in advance and by means of externally derived iron laws. It is unlikely that Zizek himself would put the matter in this fashion, because his strategy is precisely to flirt with iron principles (what he has most recently named ""lost causes"") in order to expose how the political contingencies of our world are veiled by a palliative language that uses the alibi of contingency to defeat principles.
