"The Americas in the Revolutionary Era.","Lectures by Marshall C. Eakin. 120 min. each tape.","â€¢149;Lecture 5. From Lexington and Concord to Yorktown -- Lecture 6. Radicalism of the American Revolution -- Lecture 7. Slave rebellion in St. Dominigue -- Lecture 8. Haitian Revolution. From Lexington and Concord to Yorktown: Covers the fighting during the American Revolution from Lexington and Concord to the British surrender at Yorktown in 1781, an extraordinary story of a small group of colonials challenging and defeating the most powerful empire in the world. Radicalism of the American Revolution: Discusses the ""meaning"" of the American Revolution. For some, it was a conservative effort by planters to sieze power and control the development of a society already divided between slaves and free men, white and non-whites, and the landed and landless. For others, it represented a radical break with a monarchical past and a move towards a republic and democratic politics. Slave rebellion in St. Dominigue: The Haitain revolution is the only successful slave rebellion in the Americas. This section and the next analyze the only case of slaves rising up, taking power, and creating an independent nation. Also looks at the French revolution and its influence on Saint Domingue, a classic example of the sugar and slave plantation complex in the Americas. Haitian Revolution: In 1791, thousands of slaves rose up in St. Domingue, in a war for their freedom. Amidst the violence, a group of black leaders emerged, the most famous the former slave Toussaint L'Ouverture. Over more than a decade the slaves defeated invading armies from France, England, and Spain, but the black leadership eventually turned against itself in a struggle for control of the revolution.

Napoleon invades Spain and Portugal -- Lecture 11. Francisco de Miranda: the precursor -- Lecture 12: Simon Bolivar: the liberator. Seeds of the rebellion in Spanish America: Looks at a series of wars for independence in Spanish America. By 1750, the Spanish Empire in the Americas had been in place for two and a half centuries. In the mid-18th century, the Bourbon dynasty embarked on a series of reforms to revitalize the Spanish Empire which became the source of grievances by the Creoles and their motivation to break with Spain. Napoleon invades Spain and Portugal: The Napoleonic wars and in particular Napoleon's invasion of Spain, triggered a series of mostly failed wars for independence in Spanish America after 1808. The defeat of Napoleon and the return of Fernando VII in 1814 created another flashpoint that set off a second series of wars in Spanish America that were largely successful. Francisco de Miranda, the precursor: Looks at the dramatic life of Francisco de Miranda whose life and work foreshadowed the generation of revolutonary leaders in Latin America who would lead the wars for independence. He became the early mentor of the most famous of these liberators -- Simon Bolivar. Simon Boliver, the liberator: This segment looks closely at the life of the revolutionary figure, Simon Bolivar, from his birth in Venezuela in 1783 to his first forays into politics and war in 1810. Once in power, Bolivar was never able to provide the stability needed by the new republics. He eventually returned to Europe, committing his life to the liberation of his fellow Americans.

San Martin and Argentine independence. -- Lecture 15. Bernardo O'Higgins and Chile. -- Lecture 16. Liberting Peru. Liberating Northern South America: With the imprisonment and eventual death of Miranda, Simon Boliver assumed the mantle of the leader of the South American independence movement. The liberation of Venezuela and the rest of northern South America, including Colombia, and Ecuador, proved to be a bloody and drawn out struggle that would last more than a decade. San Martin and Argentine independence: Jose de San Martin is the counterpart of Simon Bolivar in southern South America. This segment focuses on the process of independence in Argentina and Uruguay and the figure of San Martin and his leadership of the armies that liberated southern South America. Bernardo O'Higgins and Chile: Looks at the military hero Bernardo O'Higgins and his emergence as a leader in Chile after 1810. Follows the virtual civil war in Chile as Creoles vied for control and Spaniards attempted to crush the moves toward independence. Concludes with O'Higgins flight to Argentina, his relationship with Jose de San Martin, and the heroic march of their combined forces through the Andes to liberate Chile from the Spanish. Liberating Peru: The liberation of Peru, the great Spanish stronghold in South America, commencing in 1822 came from two directions: led by Simon Bolivar from the North and Jose de San Martin from the South. Bolivar led the final assult liberating Peru and upper Peru (Bolivia) with the assistance of his lieutenant, Jose Antonio de Sucre.

Brazil: a royal revolution? -- Lecture 20. Failed movements in the Caribbean. Mexico: race and class warfare: The war for Mexican independence took place in two stages. This segments looks at the first stage, a race and class war in 1810. Two priests, Miguel Hidalgo and Jose Maria Morelos, led an uprising of poor people, largely Indians, and threatened to annihilate the upper-class whites, who closed ranks to defeat the insurgency and restore order. Mexico, empire and chaos: Events in Europe sparked the second war for independence in Mexico when the supporters of a liberal constitution triumphed in Spain in 1820. A so-called ""conservative compromise"" avoided bloodshed and brokered Mexican independence when the Spanish general, Agustin de Iturbide, came over to the side of independence in 1821. Crowned Emperor Agustin I, he was quickly deposed and Mexico slid into a half century of political chaos. Brazil: a royal revolution?: Escaping the Napoleonic Wars, the Braganza royal family of Portugal settled in Rio de Janeiro and ruled its vast empire from Brazil. King Joao VI elevated Brazil to the status of a kingdom, diffusing most desires for separation and independence. When Joao returned to Portugal in 1821, the crown prince Pedro, remained in Brazil, assumed the leadership of the movement to separate from Portugal, and declared Brazil's independence in 1822. Failed movements in the Caribbean: Some of the American colonies did not achieve independence in the age of revolutions. This segment looks at Cuba and Puerto Rico, two colonies in Spanish America that failed to achieve their independence. Also examines the troubled case of the Dominican Republic, a nation that had to fight several times, first against Spain and then Haiti, to achieve its independence.

Revolutions made and unmade -- Lecture 24. Aftermath of independence. British West Indies and Canada: Canada and the British possessions in the West Indies did not seek independence. Both regions experienced a gradual transition to independence that presents a fascinating comparison to both the British North America and Latin American experience. Strange case of Paraguay: When the first set of wars for independence broke out in the La Plata region in 1808, a strong man, Jose Gaspar de Francia, emerged as the authoritarian leader of independence and the new nation. Unlike the rest of Latin America, in the aftermath of independence, Paraguay turned inward and isolated itself from the outside world until the mid-19th century. Revolutions made and unmade: This segment looks at the ""big picture,"" of the age of revolutions and the general processes across all of the Americas, comparing all the revolutions. In particular, focuses on how the differing colonial traditions (political, economic and cultural) shaped the revolutionary paths and the outcomes of the wars for independence. Aftermath of independence: Examines the larger vision of the Americas in the aftermath of the wars for independence, beginning with the key concepts of revolution and emphasizing the complex nature of the different wars for independence, as well as their common patterns. Concludes with a summary of the legacies of the wars and revolutions, in particular comparing the United States in roughly 1850 with Latin America.

"Birdsong and Coffee: A Wake Up Call","Explores the inextricable economic and environmental connections between farmers in Latin America, coffee drinkers in the U.S., and the fate of migratory songbirds throughout the Americas. Part 1 of the film examines the background and global intricacy of the ""coffee crisis,"" an ongoing situation that has been described as a ""humanitarian catastrophe."" To illustrate, we meet coffee growers in the rainforest of southern Costa Rica, whose lives vividly exemplify the unjust effects of global market mechanisms that keep coffee growers' prices down even as the retail prices for coffee increase in the U.S. Part two examines a variety of simple but effective solutions to the coffee crisis and explains the rationale behind and the importance of fair trade coffee. Produced and directed by Anne Macksoud and John Ankele. 2007. 57 min.

"U.S. Mexican War, 1846-1848.","This two-part documentary tells the story of the U.S. Mexican War in which Mexico lost almost half of its national territory to the United States.
In the first segment Mexico is suffering the aftermath of its 1820s war for independence from Spain while to the north the U.S. is expanding its territory. Tensions mount when Texas breaks free from Mexico in 1836 and is later annexed by the U.S. In 1846, U.S. and Mexican troops clash over a border dispute in Texas and war explodes. President Polk orders the U.S. Army and Navy to conquer the Mexican territories of New Mexico and California. When Mexico refuses to surrender, Polk turns his attention to Mexico City.
In the second segment former Mexican President General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna returns from exile to unite Mexico against the U.S. invasion. President Polk decides to open a second front against Mexico and strike deep into Mexico's heartland. Santa Anna is unable to turn back the invaders and a dramatic battle for Mexico City ends when the capital finally surrenders on September 14, 1847. A few months later, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo is signed, ceding all of the states of the present American Southwest to the United States.

"Havana -- The New Art of Making Ruins (Havanna -- Die Neue Kunst Ruinen zu Bauen)","In recent years, Havana has become famous all over the world for the morbid charm of its flaking facades. But these ruins are far less poetic for the people who inhabit them. Houses frequently collapse causing fatalities. This unique documentary tells the stories of the people who reside in these modern ruins, from a homeless man who lives in an abandoned theater, to an expropriated landowner who struggles against the decay of his parental home, to a writer who conceives a philosophy of the ruins to explain the gradual collapse of the city and its political system. A mixture of private history, memories, fears and hopes for the future, this documentary explores the quixotic relationship between man and architecture, man and ruins (commenting along the way on the ruin-tourism that has developed in Cuba). Spanning the entire history of Cuban architecture, from the colonial era up through the socialist revolution, this film captures the final moments of these historic buildings before they're renovated -- or simply collapse altogether.

Memories of the vanished generation, known as the Desaparecidos, have been kept alive by their surviving children (hijos), some of whom were merely days old when their parents disappeared. Until these young people began to organize and demand explanations from their government, the predominant coping strategy had been to pretend that the missing are still alive. The grief of young Argentines erupts into public action, and becomes a cornerstone for social movements from South America to Serbia. Directed and edited by John Knoop, Karina Epperlein 2009. 40 min.

"May Justice Be Done","By any standard Argentina was a very rich country until the 1970s, with competitive industries, modern agriculture, and a prosperous middle class, but by 2001, 21 out of 36 million people were living below the poverty level. This documentary traces the roots of the crisis back to the irresponsible lending policies of the international lending financial institutions. Instead of renegotiating the external debt through official channels via the Central Bank, government officials arranged deals directly with seven banks. Eschewing the laws of the market they claimed to champion, government officials assigned interest rates for bond investment that were far higher than the true market value. The result was the destruction of local industry, as credit became inaccessible and the export market suffered from unfavorable terms of trade. The inevitable default came in 2001 as a quarter of the population was reeling from rampant unemployment and the neo-liberals' destruction of the social safety net.
