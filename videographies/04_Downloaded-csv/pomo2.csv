This one-act monologue written by the playwright Sam Shepard, describes one man's quest for love: the search for romantic attachment, from infatuation to insecurity and disillusionment. Film integrates the distinctive styles of three artists: Shepard's innovative, stream-of-consciousness language; Chaikin's kinetic and exacting performance which unifies the pieces; and Clarke's dynamic choreography of image, sound and text with the syncopated use of digital effects, slow motion and editing techniques to distort and manipulate the image. 26 min.

Blindfolded, with ears plugged, two men try to sense each other's movements to assume the same motion and bearing. An off-screen voice, heard only by the audience, gives directions that would help them attain their goal.

"Centers.(1971)","The film was made by Acconci's using the video monitor as a mirror. As we look at the artist sighting along his outstretched arm and forefinger toward the center of the screen what we see is a sustained tautology: a line of sight that begins at Acconci's plane of vision and ends at the eyes of his projected double. The result turns the activity around: a pointing away from the filmaker at an outside viewer.

In this 3 part film Acconci, in a dark room burns the hair off of his chest with a candle, then plays with the illusion of having female breasts. In Parts II and III, Acconci continues to play with gender illusions via manipulations of his own body parts.

"Face-off.","This film is an ironic collusion of private and public, of exposure and masking, a tense ritual wherein Acconci divulges and then censors his self-revelations. He turns on an audiotape of his own voice addressing himself and the viewer, recounting intimate details about his life. Whenever the material becomes too personal however, he tries to drown out his voice and prevent the viewer from hearing yelling ""No, no, no, don't tell this!"" He becomes increasingly agitated as the tape proceedes. (Purchased with Stuart and Gail Buchalter Fund for the Study of Contemporary Art) 32 min.

In Soap & Eyes, he tries to keep his eyes open after dousing his face with soapsuds, resulting in a tragicomic clown face.

Created in the year of the company's 20th birthday, this epic for 10 performers creates a startling logic from the collisions of disconnected characters, stories and performances.

"Volcano Saga: Iceland, 1985.","Based on the thirteenth century Icelandic Laxdaela Saga, this narrative reverie is a retelling of a medieval myth about a young woman whose dreams foretell the future. Shot in the dramatic natural landscapes of Iceland and in New York, this performance-based work uses ancient dream analysis as a starting point for a densely textured tale, in which the young woman's interpreter hears her dreams and sees their meaning. A surrealistic ambience is created by the use of multi-layered digital effects, ghostly overlays, other-worldly images and the mythical text. 29 min.

"Vertical Roll","Using the technique of a continuous vertical roll, Jonas constructs a theater of female identity by deconstructing representations of the female body. Using her own body as performance object and video as a theatrical construct, Jonas unveils a disjunctive self-portrait. As she performs in front of the camera-- masked, wearing a feathered headdress, or costumed as a belly-dancer--her feet, torso, arms and legs, subjected to the violence of the vertical roll, appear as disembodied fragments.

"White Homeland Commando","Story 1: Adanazio -- Story 2: R.R. -- Story 3: Stephanie -- Story 4: Shelia -- Story 5: Cathy -- Story 6: Diana -- Story 7: Ray -- Story 8: Karl. An exploration of the lives of New York City detectives consisting of 8 short stories. Although fictional, the teleplay relies on a composite of actual filmed accounts of hate crimes. Shot and edited in a highly textured visual style, the colors are subdued yet somehow garish, and the sound is deliberately just out of sync with the speaker's lips. Occasional static combines with jumps in the plot reminiscent of a television viewer flipping channels. The Wooster Group's first work conceived solely for video, they have achieved an imaginative commentary on the rise of hate crimes, Klan-based electoral activity and white supremacist attitudes in the United States.

"Body Collage","Body Collage is a visceral ""movement-event"" from 1967, in which Schneemann paints her body with wallpaper paste and molasses, and then runs, leaps, falls into and rolls through shreds of white printer's paper, creating a physicalized corporal collage. ""My intention was not simply to collage my body (as an object), but to enact movement so that the collage image would be active, found, not predetermined or posed,"" writes Schneemann.

"Meat Joy.","""Meat Joy is an erotic rite -- an excessive, indulgent celebration of flesh as material : raw fish, chicken, sausages, wet paint, transparent plastic, ropes, brushes, paper scrap. Its propulsion is towards the ecstatic -- shifting and turning among tenderness, wildness, precision, abandon; qualities that could at any moment be sensual, comic, joyous, repellent. Physical equivalences are enacted as a psychic imagistic stream, in which the layered elements mesh and gain intensity by the energy complement of the audience. The original performances became notorious and introduced a vision of the sacred erotic.""

Raindance's Media Primers reflect the group's iconoclastic theories of television and video, and their engagement with alternative and mass media, pop culture and the counter-culture. The themes addressed -- media manipulation, the camera's role in modifying individual behavior -- illustrate their experimentation with the technological and conceptual underpinnings of 1/2-inch portable video. Paul Ryan's Proto Media Primer includes scenes of Abbie Hoffman awaiting the verdict from the Chicago 7 trial and ironic man-on-the-street interviews. Merging alternative video and mass media, Ira Schneider's Media Primer juxtaposes cultural indicators -- television commercials, news footage, and Portapak documentation of countercultural events such as the Altamount rock concert. In Michael Shamberg's Media Primer, rhetoric and gestures are skewered as he examines the political structure of alternative media. 56 min.
