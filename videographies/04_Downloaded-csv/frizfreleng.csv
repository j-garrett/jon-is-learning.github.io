That stops them, and they drop their booty, until the Captain sets his gun down to collect the veggies; the birds all rush in, snatch them back, and slam the gate. Except there's a straggler: one tiny chick struggling with a huge tomato. The Captain catches him, and even though the chick puts the tomato back, the Captain gives him a cute little spanking. The chick runs home and tells daddy (of course, in his version, the chick was a saint); the word is passed to ever-larger roosters, until one that's even larger than the Captain goes to settle the score. After some posturing, they fight (to the storm sequence from the William Tell Overture). The Captain is knocked out, and awakes to discover it was a dream, but he's still got the original battle with the poultry - one he finally loses as he knocks down the fence.

The black sheep talks like Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson calling the sheepdog ""Boss"" in the same fashion as Rochester used to with Jack Benny. The sheepdog has a hard time finding the disguised wolf among the sheep. He uses a mating horn that fools the wolf into turning into a Pepé Le Pew-type Casanova who grabs the sheepdog to romance him. He snaps out of it and flees. The rest of the chase is interrupted by a spoof of the Little Red Riding Hood story. When the sheepdog brags to the sheep that he caught the wolf, all the sheep take off sheep costumes to show that they are actually wolves in disguise. ""Which way did he go, George?""
