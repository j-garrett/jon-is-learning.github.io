"The 70s Dimension","TV commercials, promotional spots, and public service announcements were produced on 16mm, spooled onto mini-reels, and projected into a film-chain for telecast. They usually had a limited shelf life and were considered disposable. After a brief rotation on the air, most of them were discarded, never to be seen again. This production is a salvaged collection from the 1970s of ads, information clips, and PSA's as found in their original 16mm format that offer a glimpse into a history that was never meant to be remembered.
