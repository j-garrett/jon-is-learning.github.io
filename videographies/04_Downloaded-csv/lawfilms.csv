Cast: Ving Rhames, Ron Silver, Bruno Kirby, Darryl Alan Reed, Nicholas Pryor, Robert LuPone, Ruben Santiago-Hudson, Diana LaMar, Sandra Prosper, Clyde Kusatsu, Christopher Plummer. This is the story the public never saw of four high profile attorneys, Johnnie Cochran, Robert Shapiro, Barry Scheck and F. Lee Bailey in the O. J. Simpson murder trial. What started as a cohesive defense team ends up as a fractured and tarnished group of disagreeing attorneys vying for the spotlight and focusing as much on their egos as their defense of Simpson. The film is interspersed with real footage of the media coverage. Based on the book ""American tragedy"" by Lawrence Schiller and James Willwerth. Special features (Disc 2): O.J.

"Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (1956)","Director, Fritz Lang. Cast: Dana Andrews, Joan Fontaine, Sidney Blackmer, Arthur Franz, Philip Bourneuf, Edward Binns, Shepperd Strudwick, Robin Raymond, Barbara Nichols. Crusading publisher Austin Spenser wants to prove a point about the insufficiency of circumstantial evidence. Spencer talks his prospective son-in-law Tom Garrett into participating in a hoax, the better to expose the alleged ineptitude of conviction-happy DA. Tom will plant clues indicating that he is the murderer of a nightclub dancer, then stand trial for murder; just as the jury reaches its inevitable guilty verdict, Spencer will step forth to reveal the set-up and humiliate the DA. Somewhat surprisingly, Tom eagerly agrees to this subterfuge. Unfortunately, an unforeseen event renders their perfectly formed scheme useless. 61 min.

","Lawyers and the Legal Process in the Movies"
"The Bonfire Of The Vanities (1990)","Directed by Brian De Palma. Cast: Tom Hanks, Bruce Willis, Melanie Griffith, Morgan Freeman. A Wall Street wheeler-dealer has everything going his way. But one night, in the right car with the wrong woman, he took a wrong turn at the wrong place, and nothing has gone right ever since! ""Tom Wolfe's sprawling comic novel about rampant greed and the varying degrees of culture-blindness in mid-'80s New York revolves around the arrest of a bond trader accused of running over an inner-city youth. The incident prompts a lot of grandstanding in the press and in the black community--as well as an opposite overreaction in the business world and in Jewish legal circles-and culminates in a trial that exposes the venality of most of the story's major players. Brian De Palma's disastrous big-screen adaptation of The Bonfire Of The Vanities was plagued with behind-the-scenes problems and studio tampering (as documented in Julie Salamon's excellent book The Devil's Candy), perhaps most notably in its climactic trial scene. Already forced by his backers to replace Alan Arkin with Morgan Freeman for the judge role (in order to defuse some of the racial implications of the ending), De Palma was also asked to give Freeman a big closing speech to help alleviate the perceived frustrations of the movie audience. And so while Wolfe trusts Bonfire's readers to recognize exaggeration as a tool of satire, Bonfire's viewers are treated to the sight of Freeman waxing self-righteous in the courtroom, castigating all the story's characters, then concluding with the line, 'Decency is what your grandmother taught you... now go home and be decent people.' Um... is that sentence legally binding?""

Fourteen years after being imprisoned, psychopath Max Cady emerges with a single-minded mission: to seek revenge on his attorney Sam Bowden. ""Martin Scorsese's remake of 'Cape Fear' portrays an attorney's struggle with his own hypocrisy. Attorney Sam Bowden is 'tried' by a former client, Max Cady. Bowden suppressed evidence which might have exonerated Cady. Nick Nolte's performance as Bowden explores the 'lawyer mask', which some practitioners hide behind, espousing ethics and objectivity in professional life, but not living up to these codes in personal life.""

""Courtroom scenes don't come much crazier than in the Marx brothers' greatest film. Chico takes the stand in a court-martial after having served as a spy for the nation of Sylvania while he happened to be employed as the Secretary Of War for Freedonia; when informed he will be shot if found guilty, he objects on the grounds that he 'couldn't think of anything else to say.' (Freedonian leader Groucho sustains the objection because he can't think of anything else to say, either.) When it looks hopeless for Chico because he can't find anyone in the country willing to defend him on the charge of treason, Groucho switches from prosecution to defense after he learns there's $18 in it for him. The trial ends inconclusively—a war breaks out and interrupts the proceedings—but the tenor of it is summed up in Groucho's lament to Chico that he 'tried to get a writ of habeas corpus, but I should have got-a writ of you instead.'""

"Serial Mom (1994)","Directed by John Waters. Cast: Kathleen Turner, Sam Waterston, Ricki Lake, Suzanne Somers. ""John Waters' satire Serial Mom works just fine when it functions as a send-up of proper middle-class manners: Kathleen Turner's prim and proper mother is driven to murderous rage by her neighbors' minor transgressions, like failing to rewind rented videotapes. But when she's finally arrested and put on trial, the satire kicks into high gear, as our societal obsession with criminals as celebrities is lampooned in grand fashion. Acting as her own attorney, the newly famous Turner impugns police testimony by branding the cop on the stand as a porn freak, shuts down a key piece of evidence when Suzanne Somers arrives in court to prepare for a TV movie in which she'll portray 'Serial Mom,' turns the jury against one hostile witness by revealing that she doesn't recycle, and converts a snitch to her side by giving him a gratuitous bit of MILF upskirt. The only thing that interferes with her brilliant self-defense is when she's homicidally distracted by one juror's insistence on wearing white shoes after Labor Day.""
