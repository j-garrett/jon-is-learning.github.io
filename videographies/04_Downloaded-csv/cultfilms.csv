Music: Fireworks / Respighi ; Puce moment / Jonathan Halper ; Rabbit's moon (La lune des lapins) / the Flamingos ...[et al] ; Eaux d'artifice / Vivaldi ; Inauguration of the pleasure dome / Janacek. Fireworks: Kenneth Anger, Bill Selzer, Gordon Grey ; Puce moment: Yvonne Marquis ; Rabbit's moon (La lune des lapins): Andre Souberyan, Claude Revenant, Nadine Valence ; Eaux d'artifice: Carmillo Salvatorelli ; Inauguration of the pleasure dome: Samson De Brier, Cameron, Kathryn Kadell, Renata Loome, Anais Nin, Kenneth Anger, Peter Loome, Paul Mathison, Curtis Harrington, Joan Whitney. In Fireworks a dissatisfied dreamer awakes, goes out in the night seeking a light and is drawn through the needle's eye to return less empty than before. Puce Moment reflects Anger's concerns with the myths and decline of Hollywood. Rabbit's moon, a fable of the unattainable (the Moon) combines elements of Commedia dell'Arte with Japanese myth. Eaux d'artifice portrays hide and seek in a night-time labyrinth of levels, cascades, balustrades, grottoes and fountains. In Inauguration of the pleasure dome, members of a cult masquerade as gods and goddesses. Special features: Screen specific audio commentaries for all films by Kenneth Anger; Rabbit's moon outtakes; 48 page full color book featuring: an introduction by Martin Scorsese; Kenneth Anger's hand drawn sketches for the unrealized Puce Women project; excerpts from Anais Nin's diaries about making of Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome; rare behind the scenes stills and more.
In Fireworks a dissatisfied dreamer awakes, goes out in the night seeking a light and is drawn through the needle's eye to return less empty than before. Puce Moment reflects Anger's concerns with the myths and decline of Hollywood. Rabbitt's Moon is a fable of the unattainable (the Moon) combining elements of Commedia dell'Arte with Japanese myth. Eaux d'Artifice portrays hide and seek in a night-time labyrinth of levels, cascades, balustraces, grottoes and fountains. Kustom Kar Kommandos is a voyeuristic look at a tight-jeaned man polishing his car. Anger's short films represent a vision of ""repressed homosexual desires, twarted in real life and painfully exorcized onscreen. Anger, a highschool student who had grown up on Hollywood's sanitized images, filled Fireworks with his hidden fantasies, complete with the bald sexuality inherent in the images of cowboys, test pilots and, in this case, sailors, images that dominated the dreams of millions.""

Part of the New York 'underground,' George and brother Mike were unusual in wanting to make lavish melodramas. Handpainted titles, lurid colour and sound, tabloid-type tales, startling hair-dos and vivid costumes blend and sometimes clash inimitably in these four startling, funny and bittersweet films.

"Flaming Creatures. (1963)","Directed by Jack Smith. Sensual underground classic film which pushed the limits of its day while surviving attempts to censor its content, including a series of police raids, arrests, and court battles. ""It may seem tame by today's standards, but it stretched the limits of its day. Campy and lavishly designed in its experimentalism, [Smith's] best know film, includes characters which cavort in a setting reminiscent of the court of Ali Baba, with a mood suggestive of the paintings of Heironymous Bosch. The film is a quasi-documentary of Androgynes and Transvestites in which flaccid penises and bouncing breasts are so ambiguously equated as to disarm any distinction between male and female. In Flaming Creatures, Smith manages to combine the ornate imagination of his youth with the realities of his adult fantasy.""
