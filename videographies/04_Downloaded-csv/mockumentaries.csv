"Bontoc Eulogy","A personal and poignant docu-drama that examines the Filipino experience at the 1904 St. Louis World's fair. The film focuses on the filmmaker's grandfather, an Igorot warrior, one of the 1,100 tribal natives displayed as anthropological 'specimens' in the Philippine village exhibit. A unique fusion of rare archival images, verite, and carefully orchestrated visual sequences shot in the present, the film is an innovative investigation of history, memory and the spectacle of the ""other"" in the turn-of-the-century America.

"Dark Side of the Moon","The progress of film and television technology has made it possible to manipulate images without it being obvious. This documentary begins with the revelation that director Stanley Kubrick contributed to the success of the US space program with his film ""2001: A space odyssey."" With the support of NASA, Kubrick invented an astonishing scenario for the images of the moon landing, validating it with ""hijacked"" archival footage, false documents, and authenic interviews out of context. As the documentary progresses it forces the viewer to realize how difficult it is to separate truth from manipulation in the media. Director, William Karel. 2002. 52 min.

"EPIC 2014.(1967)","A film by Matt Thompsonand Robin Sloan. ""The year is 2014. the press as we know it no longer exists. Traditional reporting has collapsed. News is churned out by the media giant Googlezon. (Google has taken over many companies and joined forces with Amazon.) The news consists of blogs, attitudes, discoveries, preferences, claims, and random thoughts, gathered and shaped by computers and a few human editors, then fed back to ordinary people who produce the continuing conversation. The New York Times is off the Internet. It still publishes, but the newspaper has become a newsletter read only by the elite and the elderly. This is the finding of a clever, eight-minute mock documentary, EPIC 2014, produced by the fictional Museum of Media History (in reality, journalists Matt Thompson of the Fresno Bee and Robin Sloan of Current, a new cable news channel in San Francisco). Thompson and Sloan recently added a short section taking the history up to 2015. The mockumentary is starting to reach a mass audience at a time of unusually high anxiety for the news industry. The news business has been hobbled by a string of scandals and credibility problems. Skirmishes between reporters and bloggers seem like the beginning of a long war between old media and new. Newspaper publishers are nervous--some would say paralyzed with fright--over polls showing that young adults are not reading papers. Their audience is dying off. A lot of young people say they get their news from a brief look at headline news or from late-night comedians. [Leo, John. ""Googling the Future.(mockumentary explores the future of news media).""

"F is for Fake (1973)","Directed and written by Orson Welles. This film-essay, done in a pseudo-documentary style is a meditation on illusionism, the role of the artist being that of a charlatan-magician. Portraits of art forger Elmyr de Hory (using footage from Francois Reichenbach's film) and Clifford Irving (forger of Howard Hughes' autobiography) intermingle with Welle's own connection with ""fakes"" -- Picasso paintings and his famous War of the Worlds radio broadcast. Above all, Welles delights in the artifice of the cinema -- the power of editing to ""fake,"" cinematic space. DVD special features: Disc 1. The film: audio commentary by Ojar Kodar and Gary Graver; introduction by Peter Bogdanovich; extended 9-min. trailer -- Disc 2. ""Orson Welles: one-man band"" (1995), an 88-minute documentary about Welles's unfinished projects; ""Almost true: the noble art of forgery"" (1997), a 52-minute documentary about art forger Elmyr de Hory; a ""60 minutes"" interview with Clifford Irving, from 2000, about his Howard Hughes autobiography hoax; a 1972 Hughes press conference exposing Irving's hoax; a new essay by film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum.

Recently divorced and living in his mother's basement, Marquez desperately wants his big break; instead he's pushed to the edge of a breakdown. At M.U.F.F., absurdity piles onto absurdity as the charmingly naive Marquez enters a zany world of bitter veteran filmmakers, self-important Hollywood executives, preening actor-gods, and obnoxious groupies.

""...Focuses on the Las Hurdes region of Spain, the mountainous area around the town La Alberca, and the intense poverty of its occupants. Buñuel, who made the film after reading the ethnographic study Las Jurdes: étude de géographie humaine (1927) by Maurice Legendre, took a Surrealist approach to the notion of the anthropological expedition. The result was a travelogue in which the narrator's extreme (indeed, exaggerated) descriptions of human misery of Las Hurdes contrasts with his flat and disinterested manner.

"--No Lies","Directed by Mitchell W. Block. 1972. The film unfolds as a conversation between a male interviewer and a young woman who has recently been raped. The interviewer's probing questions strip away the woman's defenses, offering an intimate view of the trauma suffered by a rape victim as she confronts the police, her doctor, her friends, and her conscience.
""...No Lies is more than just a critique of the verite style. When the credits appear at the end of the film and provide the only clue that the film is a ""fake"" 'not a ""real""' documentary, the first-time viewer may be more than a little puzzled. Eitzen writes that the film adheres so rigorously to documentary form that first-time viewers who were unaware of the film's true nature often become ""visibly disturbed"" at how the character of the filmmaker treats the woman. Upon being told that it is a fiction film, these same people redirect much of their anger to Mitchell Block, the man who made the film. ""Viewers now feel angry at having been duped,"" he writes. Eitzen attributes this anger to the fact that the film lies about its true nature. It pretends to be a documentary, but is not. He states that No Lies is ""a fiction film about rape, but it is a documentary about documentaries. But No Lies is unusual among mock documentaries, as it has the power to enrage its viewers by its central deception. Also, its principal goal is to dupe the audience, something not found in such extreme measures in later mock documentaries (though Man Bites Dog (1991) and Forgotten Silver (1996) come close).""

"Symbiopsychotaxiplasm: Take One","Cast: Patricia Ree Gilbert, Don Fellows, Jonathan Gordon, Bob Rosen, William Greaves. Director William Greaves presides over a beleaguered film crew in New York's Central Park, leaving them to try to figure out what kind of movie they're making. A couple enacts a breakup scenario over and over as a documentary crew films the crew filming the action. Locals wander casually into the frame: the project defies easy description. Yet this wildly innovative sixties counterculture landmark remains one of the most tightly focused and insightful movies ever made about making movies. Special features: ""Discovering William Greaves"": a new documentary on Greave's career, featuring Greaves, his wife and coproducer Louise Archambault, actress Ruby Dee, filmmaker St. Clair Bourne, and film scholar Scott MacDonald; theatrical trailer. 1968. 75 min.
