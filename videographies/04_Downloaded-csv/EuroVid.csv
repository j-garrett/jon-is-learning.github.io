"â€¢149;A Vision of the World","This program delves into Kahn's origins and formative years and the launch of his Archive of the Planet project. Topics include Kahn's Jewish ancestry and Alsacian upbringing; his early success in finance; his admiration of Japanese art and customs; the development of autochrome photography by the Lumière brothers; Marguerite Mespoulet's colorful documentation of Ireland's vanishing Celtic traditions; and Kahn's expedition to Cornwall and London with August Leon. 50 min.

Viewers will encounter startling images of early 20th century Manhattan, San Francisco, Tokyo and Beijing, as well as views of nascent Rio de Janeiro and burgeoning Buenos Aires. Scenes from Tsarist Siberia, the Mongolian steppes, a Varanasi teeming with worshippers, and a camel-and-elephant caravan on the Khyber Pass reaffirm the spectacular value of Kahn's grand project. 52 min.

From France to the Balkans, leaders prescribed nationalism and military buildup as the only solutions. This program studies the continent's march to war as depicted in the photographic record commissioned by French banker Albert Kahn. Early color images and film footage explore a range of themes -- including contrasts between urbanization and rural life in France, Germany and Scandinavia, the decline of the Ottoman Empire and its impact in Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece and Macedonia; and the grittiness of everyday life in Europe. kahn's pacifism is also a topic. 51 min.

A century later, this program presents the results -- revealing the life and environment of the French soldier as recorded in Kahn's Archive of the Planet. The visual details of trench warfare and all its misery are combined with pictures from towns, hospitals , and barracks a few miles from the front -- evoking the humanity of the ordinary fighting man as well as the appalling devastation wrought by the era's instruments of death. 52 min.

This program explores both the propaganda value and the genuine emotional power in images of the war-torn French populace. French and Belgian refugees, ruined churches, and farms tended by women and the elderly are a few of the subjects rendered in exquisite and moving detail. Soissons smolders after a German retreat; Reims and its shattered cathedral hover on the edge of total destruction; and the Alsace region, Kahn's birthplace, regains its French identity. 52 min.

This program focuses on Kahn's pictorial record of the war's aftermath and the challenges of securing a true peace across Europe. Zeppelin-borne aerial footage conveys the scope of the destruction, while grave-digging and burial scenes evoke the staggering number of combatants killed. Other events and subjects include the influx of foreign workers that filled France's labor void; the French occupation of the Rhineland; German breadlines and Paris dance-halls; and war monuments in London and Verdun. 52 min.

With typical global awareness, photography archivist Albert Khan chose to document the historic changes occurring in the colonial Middle East. This program traces his team's expeditions into Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine as Western powers redrew the map of the region. The French takeover of Syria, the Balfour Declaration, and Turkey’s war with Greece come to life in Kahn’s street-level films and autochromes-- which also serve as reminders that Jerusalem, like many other Middle East locations, suffered greatly during World War I. 52 min.

This program recounts journeys through Indochina and greater Asia in which the Kahn team opened up a world most Europeans had never dreamed of. Viewers discover Vietnam through its beggars, Tet celebrants and elegantly dressed Mandarin administrators; Cambodia, through its dancers and the imposing Angkor City complex; Japan, through rapidly Westernizing homes, dress and hairstyles; and India, through pictures of the maharajahs and other authorities rendered powerless by British rule. 51 min.

This program follows the maritime odyssey of Lucien Le Saint, circa 1922, as he captured on film the daily lives of Newfoundland cod fisherman, as well as expeditions into northwestern Africa. Images from Morocco and Tunisia focus on occupying French soldiers, the prostitutes they patronized, and larger changes in those societies, while pictures taken in Dahomey (now Benin) shed light on the symbiotic relationship between Catholocism and the Vodun religion. Viewers also learn about the Colonial Exhibition of 1931, Kahn's financial collapse, and the fate of his archive after his death in 1940. 51 min.

"The Anti-Americans: A Hate/Love Relationship","Why does Europe hate us? It's a question that comes to mind for many Americans when they see polls proclaiming that one out of two Europeans sees America as playing a negative role in the world. A whimsical, yet serious look at the estrangement between Europeans and Americans, this documentary travels to Ireland, France, Poland and Great Britain to examine the thesis that each country responds to American culture and society in a unique way.

"Boomtime, 1948. (People's Century, 1997.)","After World War II, the USA enjoyed unparalleled prosperity while Europe and much of the rest of the world suffered from devastation, lack of food and other necessities, and unemployment. The American Marshall Plan assisted Europe greatly in its recovery from the war and helped Europeans learn the 'American way' of doing things. Europeans began changing their economy by themselves and became consumers as well as producers. This prosperity lasted until 1973, when the certainty of cheap oil and a world dominated by the West was over. It was the beginning of the end of the greatest boom of the century. 56 min.

Out of their bloody struggle emerges a new dynasty as well as three of the most famous kings: Henry II, Richard I and John. At the heart of this medieval history lies the relationship between church and state, most notably represented by Thomas Becket and Henry II. Nations (Pt.4): In the 13th century, the people of Britain found their voice: proud and nationalistic, developed as a response to the subjugation in the campaigns of Edward I to extend his authority over Wales, Scotland, and Ireland.

Images of London in 1992 are accompanied by an unnamed fictional narrator and Keiller's imaginary protagonist Robinson. The latter is attempting to research the city's artistic past and support alternative paths that the city's history might have taken. The film is made up of three ""expeditions"" and other mini-journeys on foot into a London that few tourists will ever see. The paths taken are inspired by literary-historical concerns but contemporary political events intrude. The two reflect on how political decisions might impact upon the city's future.

"Young, Muslim, and French","Europe's Muslim population has doubled in the last decade, with the largest numbers settling in France. This Wide Angle documentary reveals the hopes, frustrations, and political aspirations of French-born Muslims and explores their potential to alter the landscape of France's national identity. Focusing on the recent decision to ban the wearing of traditional Muslim headscarves in public schools, the program shows how the controversy has played out in Dammarie-les-Lys, a racially diverse, working-class community on the outskirts of Paris. The result is an eye-opening depiction of Islamic Europe's increasingly vocal demand for integration on its own terms. In addition, Professor Fawaz Gerges discusses secularism in France with anchor Mishal Husain. Dist.: Ѭ href=""http://www.films.com"">Films Media Group.Ж 60 min.

"Roma Rights(Life; 5)","The Roma have an exotic image: musicians, actors, artists, and sometimes beggars. Europeans called them 'Gypsies' because they thought they came from Egypt. But Romani people have lived in Europe for over a thousand years, and they originally came from India, not Egypt. Roma communities in Europe have been subjected to centuries of persecution and racism. They are one of the most excluded groups in the world. They are denied the chance to work, proper housing, healthcare and their children refused a decent education. A new initiative - the Decade of Roma Inclusion - was launched in 2005 in a concerted attempt to help break the desperate cycle of poverty in which so many Roma live.

"We Have No War-Songs: Gypsies: the Professional Amateurs of Life.","Since their appearance in Europe first recorded in the 14th century, the Gypsies have always struggled for the freedom to live their own lives in their own way. They have been persecuted, tortured, expelled and killed, and yet remain unique as the only nation of people that have never written or sung war songs. Filmed at the seven day gathering of thousands of Gypsies from all over the World in Saintes Maires de-la Mer in the South of France, this film celebrates the unique nature of the Gypsy people and poses questions of tolerance and individuality in today's increasingly materialistic and nationalistic world.
