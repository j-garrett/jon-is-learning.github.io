Tougher-than-nails landowner Jessica Drummond has ruled over her county in Arizona with such power that even the local sheriff won't stand up to her. And when gunslinger-turned-U.S. marshal Griff Bonnell and his brothers seek to restore law and order, they meet with harsh resistance, that is until Jessica falls in love with Bonnell. But when the man's brother is murdered and the two families become bitter enemies, Jessica's loyalty is divided, and Bonnell faces his biggest moral dilemma : how to avenge his brother's death and still maintain his vow of non-violence. 79 min.

"The Furies (1950)","Directed by Anthony Mann. Cast: Barbara Stanwyck, Wendell Corey, Walter Huston, Judith Anderson, Gilbert Roland, Thomas Gomez, Beulah Bondi, Albert Dekker, John Bromfield, Wallace Ford, Blanche Yurka, Louis Jean Heydt, Frank Ferguson, Charles Evans, Movita Casteneda, Craig Kelly, Myrna Dell. ""Vance Jeffords (Barbara Stanwyck) is her father's daughter. And what a father! T.C. Jeffords is a cross between King Lear and Captain Bligh. Walter Huston, in his last role, manages to make this egomaniacal tyrant both frightening and likeable. He handily blows nominal leading man and Noir veteran Wendell Corey off this screen, but Stanwyck, in one of her last great performances, matches him in flamboyance and audacity. When he remarries (jilting daughter for Easterner Judith Anderson's fortune) Stanwyck disfigures his new bride with a well thrown scissors! When he hangs her Mexican lover (Gilbert Roland) she embarks on a relentless campaign to ruin him. The film seems to revel in the mutual ruthlessness of father and daughter. It also boasts a vicious turn by Thomas Gomez as ""El Tigre, T.C... Jeffords' chief pistolero who is eager to throw the rope over Gilbert Roland's neck. Gomez was fresh from his greatest role in Abraham Polonsky's ""Force of Evil."" So in love are father and daughter, that although Stanwyck ultimately gains the upper hand and the ability to crush her father, she can't bring herself to do it. That job is outsourced to Gilbert Roland's vengeful, seemingly insane mother who guns the robber baron down in the street. "" [Shepler, Michael.

"Little Big Man (1970)","Directed by Arthur Penn. Cast: Dustin Hoffman, Martin Balsam, Jeff Corey, Chief Dan George, Faye Dunaway, Richard Mulligan. Jack Crabb (Dustin Hoffman) is 121 years old.

He's been a full-fledged Cheyenne, an Indian fighter, a snake oil merchant, master gunman, drinking buddy of wild Bill Hickok, colleague of Buffalo Bill, and is the only survivor of Custer's Last Stand. Crabb is either the Old West's most neglected hero or the biggest liar ever to cross the Mississippi. Little Big Man is Jack Crabb's story. In their article, ""The Hollywood Indian in Little Big Man: A Revisionist View,"" Margo Kasdan and Susan Tavernetti comment: "" In Little Big Man, Arthur Penn directed a film that inverts the mythologies of American frontier history usually presented in the western genre, and, in particular, the story of the westward expansion. The film combines established generic conventions--the post-Civil War period, Great Plains setting, conflict between whites and Indians--with a reconsideration of western history, a revisionist treatment of legendary figures of the time, of the western hero, and of Native Americans in a comic and ironic tone. This combination makes the film distinctive (while at the same time sows the seeds for such contemporary westerns as Dances with Wolves). (Film & History, xxiii (1993), 70).

""This film advanced the career of Robert Mitchum, a new star, and one who had already had a background in noir with the classic ""Out of the Past"" as well as in other noir-tinged works as ""Undercurrent"", ""Crossfire"" and ""When Strangers Marry."" Along with ""The Furies,"" ""Pursued"" qualifies as one of the few Freudian Westerns in that the protagonist, Jeff Callam, has been adapted and raised by the Callams following the unsolved mass murder of his family. He is plagued by nightmares involving gunfire and flashing spurs but he can never clearly see the faces of his parent's killers. In the course of the film he loses a coin toss with his step-brother and goes off to fight in the Spanish American War. On returning, he is forced to kill his step-brother in a gunfight and finds himself tormented by what he sees as an unnatural love for his step-sister. Combined with his recurring nightmares, Jeff proves a very modern figure, very like a shell-shocked G.I. returning from World War II. James Wong Howe, who had the same year, shot the classic noir boxing film, ""Body and Soul,"" with John Garfield, brought a dark brooding look to the film, with the night scenes providing a visual portrait of the protagonist's inner torment.""

Jeff Hillington is the extremely naive son of a wealthy Eastern family --he loves the old west so much he romanticizes its glories. When his father sends him to Arizona on business, Jeff expects it to be the place he read about in dime-store novels, and to appease him, the townsfolk put on a wild west show that turns real. 47 min.
