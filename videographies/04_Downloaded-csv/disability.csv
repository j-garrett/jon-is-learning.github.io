"Annie Dearest: The Real Miracle Worker","Conceived by deaf lesbian performance artist and playwright Terry Galloway, 'Annie Dearest' is a video parody of The Miracle Worker. Galloway and her creative team take about 9 minutes to demolish the myth of the sainted relationship between Helen Keller and teacher Annie Sullivan; a myth that Galloway feels has inspired but intimidated generations of deaf and hard of hearing children who were force-fed The Miracle Worker. This short parody takes a humorous look at how Keller may have been taught by a not so patient Sullivan. The 2 minute apologia that follows is a satire of another sort. Featuring the lip-reading video creator and her signing stand-in, it offers a critique in the guise of contriteness-addressing the outrage the video frequently inspires.

Constantly shadowed by their guide, Mrs. Pak, they fake allegiance to Kim Jong-il and hope for ""One Korea."" Only Jacob is allowed to speak his mind.

A central figure in the oralist controversy is Jacob Rodrigue Pereire. He claimed to have a secret method for teaching deaf children to speak. This episode is ""a record of the efforts of hearing people to supplant the language of the deaf with their language, to replace signs with speech."" 33 min. 
â€¢149; A Tale Based on Fact. This film focuses on Abbe de L'Epee, and the beginning of world wide education for deaf people. The chance encounter between Abbe de L'Epee and two deaf sisters launched him on his career with deaf students and inspired the abbe to begin his school. What is remarkable is that this occurred in an age when the majority view was that deaf people had no abstract ideas, no memory and, of course, no language. ""Fortunately, Eppe's independence of spirit kept him from adopting the prevailing views uncritically."" 28 min. 
â€¢149;Success and Failure. This film centers around two men, Jean-Marc Itard and Baron Joseph Marie De Gerando, who expended great time and energy in futile efforts to transform deaf students into pseudo-hearing students. There were, fortunately, outspoken critics of these efforts...men such as Ferdinand Berthier and Roch-Ambroise Bebian. In the end, both Itard and De Gerando learned the lessons of their failed experiments. 40 min. 
â€¢149;Fortune and Misfortune. This film centers on events that lead to the founding of education for deaf students in the United States. Thomas Gallaudet, encouraged by Mason Cogswell to learn the European methods of educating deaf students, enrolls at Saint-Jacques. It is here that Gallaudet convinces Laurent Clerc to accompany him to Hartford to assist in founding a school for the deaf in the United States. ""You will be a living proof that what has been believed impossible--the education of those born deaf--is indeed possible."" 30 min. 
â€¢149;Spreading the Word.This film centers around the efforts of Gallaudet and Clerc to establish the American Asylum, recruit students and seek funding for the school and its programs. These efforts involved extensive travel and public lectures not only to solicit funds but also to recruit students so the school would flourish. Within a dozen years of its founding the school was receiving students from half the states in the Union. ""This assembly of much of the deaf youth of America in one place was one of the main forces that created a true society of the deaf with a single language serving to bind them together."" 24 min. 
â€¢149;Concerning Women. In this film four women who made significant contributions to the education of the deaf are discussed: Alice Cogswell, Julia Brace, Eliza Boardman Clerc, and Sophia Fowler Gallaudet. Alice Cogswell was the deaf daughter of Mason Cogswell, and the source of the motivation of this pioneer educator; Julia Brace was the first educated deaf-blind person in America; Eliza Boardman, a student at the American Asylum, married Laurent Clerc, in what was the first deaf marriage in America; Sophia Fowler was the fourteen student to enter the school and eventually married Thomas Gallaudet. Their fourth son became president of the National Deaf-Mute College in Washington, D.C. 19 min. 
â€¢149; A Dangerous Incursion. Describes attempts to eradicate and eliminate the language and society of the deaf that had been nurtured at the American Asylum in Hartford. Horace Mann and Samuel Gridley Howe, self-proclaimed social reformers, squandered time, effort and money on the surface appearance of oral language rather than on the true bedrock of intellectual development. ""Powerful hearing people want to replace our language, to educate us in a foreign tongue, to disperse our gatherings, to ban our marriages."" 18 min. 
â€¢149; The Denial. This film centers upon the opposed viewpoints concerning signed and oral languages between Alexander Graham Bell and Laurent Clerc. Bell was a firm believer in oralism while Clerc favored a deaf community and sign language. Clerc believed that the overriding purpose of education was personal fulfillment, while for Bell it was integration of deaf persons with the hearing majority. 37 min. 
â€¢149;The Incurable Deafness. This final film of the series is reported from the perspective of Harlan Lane concerning his views on the current situation for deaf persons. He believes that the congress held by the Pereire Society in 1880 in Milan was ""the single most critical event which released a tidal wave or oralism which resulted in the submersion of sign language and signing communities. He feels the dominance of oralism and the supression of signing have resulted in the limited educational achievement of today's deaf men and women, 80% of whom, in America, are engaged in manual or unskilled labor."" 24 min.

Aletheia: The introductory tape to The Blindness Series, aletheia presents an indexing of categories investigating different aspects of blindness as metaphor. Operculum: The artist visits with seven cosmetic surgeons specializing in blepharoplasty (cosmetic eyelid creasing surgery) for initial consultation sessions. The doctors demonstrate different reshaping options and comment upon the prevalence and success rates for different Asian nationalities. Koré: By focusing on the blindfold, kore explores the eye as purveyor of desire, sexual fear, and the fantasy of blindness. Ocularis : eye surrogates: This video highlights several narratives concerning video surveillance -- not to reiterate the conventional privacy argument but rather to engage the desire to watch surveillance materials and society's insatiable voyeurism.

Ekleipsis: Inspired by a New York Times article about a group of hysterically blind Cambodian women in Long Beach, California, known as the largest group of such people in the world. Hysterical blindness is sight loss brought about by traumatic stress. The video delves into two histories: the history of hysteria and the Cambodian civil war, and speaks about the somatization of pain and loss. Alexia: An experimental video about word-blindness and metaphor, with accounts of Giambattista Vico's theory on the origin of language and Ludwig Wittgenstein's theory on aspect-blindness. Word-blindness is a condition that usually afflicts people who have suffered a stroke, causing them to lose the visual recognition of individual letters but perceive the entire word, or vice versa. Amaurosis: A documentary about Dat Nguyen, a blind guitarist living in Little Saigon, Orange County, California. Dat Nguyen was a ""triple outcast"": blind, Amerasian, and an impoverished orphan. The tape strives to present the life of one member from this unique community and promote his rich contributions. Epilogue: the palpable invisibility of life: Visualizes the unseen threads between mother and child, revealing how the ties that bind four generations of women become manifest when a great-grandmother's imploring words to persevere, passed from granddaughter to great granddaugheter, compel a woman to continue her maternal line by ancient means. 2009. 72 min."
