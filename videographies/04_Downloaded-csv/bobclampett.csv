In addition, the Gremlin's behavior is possibly a homage to Bob Clampett's version Daffy Duck (for example, he is seen in one scene riding an invisible bicycle, one of Daffy's old trademarks, among other acts.)"" The Gremlin holds the distinction, along with Cecil Turtle,the unnamed mouse from ""Rhapsody Rabbit"" and the fly from Baton Bunny, of being one of the very few antagonists to actually outsmart and rattle Bugs.""
