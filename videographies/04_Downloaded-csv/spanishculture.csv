"States of Terror: Counter-terrorism in the Basque Country (Etats de terreur: Guerre Sle au Pays Basque)","Separatist movement. Following an attempted right-wing coup in 1981, Spanish government officials secretly formed the GAL, an organization whose purpose was to attack ETA using similar methods of violence and terror. After a pivotal meeting with President Francois Mitterrand, Spain received the support it needed when France agreed to assist the GAL in their operations. Concentrating on the French Basque country --a sanctuary for many of ETA's members-- GAL actions were directed by Spanish government officials, deploying hired mercenaries to carry out bombings, kidnappings and assassinations with the compliance and assistance of the French police. Through interviews with government officials, judicial officials and prosecutors, journalists, and the families of victims - and incorporating rare archival footage --the director conducts a methodical investigation into the Anti-Terrorist Liberation Group (GAL).

Performer: Francisco Reiguera, Akim Tamiroff, Orson Welles; subsequent dubbed voices, Jose Mediavilla, Juan Carlos Ordonez, Constantino Romero. In this film, Welles is reviewing the personalities of Cervantes' Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. Welles has placed the characters in 1960's modern Spain and uses them as commentary on Spain's social life. Behaviors and customs, particularly bullfights, are explored. This dramatization of the Don Quixote story compiled of film fragments from Orson Welles, offers viewers a unique opportunity to see some of the master's mature story ideas onscreen and footage of the famed director at work. Originally released as a motion picture in 1992, although Orson Welles did not complete this film. The film was reconstructed from fragments that were studied and analyzed by Jess Franco, who adapted the film along with Javier Mina, who assisted with dialogue adaptation. PAL format  min.
