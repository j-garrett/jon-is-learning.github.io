"General Works on Modernist and Avant-garde ArtsЖ

"
"After Modernism: The Dilemma of Influence","The purposeful dismantling of the modernist myth has been the central issue of contemporary art making and art criticism. Since the 1960s, other disciplines, cultures and artists previously excluded from modernism's privileged canons have become absorbed into an ever expanding field of activity and influence. Younger artsts are a new breed of cultural scavengers -- anything is fair game for appropriation or reinterpretation. Here various modernists discuss their art works. 1992. 59 min.

Also presents the work of Robert Henri, George Bellows, Marcel Duchamp, Charles Demuth, Arthur Dove, Georgia O'Keeffe, Mabel Dodge Luhand, Marsden Hartley and Frank Lloyd Wright.

"â€¢149; The Empire of Signs. After the post-war era, Hughes traces the development of abstract expressionism and the life of Jackson Pollock, and explores how artists as different as James Rosenquist, Claes Oldenburg, Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman, David Smith, Willem De Kooning, Robert Rauschenberg, Romare Bearden, Joseph Cornell, Andy Warhol and Jasper Johns reacted to the new consumer culture.

"â€¢149; The Age of Anxiety. This final segment explores how American art has reflected the upheavals of the last 25 years. Hughes traces the evolution of abstract art and minimalism and considers the spiritual richness of earth works, in which nature is the artist's medium. He ends the series by profiling a wide range of contemporary artists including Edward Kienholz, Donald Judd, Richard Serra, Walter De Maria, Robert Smithson, Bruce Nauman, Richard Diebenkorn, Philip Guston, Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons, Susan Rothenberg, Eric Fischl, Louise Bourgeois and James Turrell.

Long before home video there flourished an alternative cinema culture on college campuses and around art theaters, where foreign film fare was often accompanied by a short subject. As reliable 16mm film equipment became available to non-professionals, artists independent of film centers began experimenting with cinema. Serious film societies sprang up in New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, holding semi-private screenings of non-commercial artistic films. This collection is of mainly American pictures, principally one-man artistic endeavors made from little more than an artist's desire to express feelings with a camera. 289 min.

Different styles and genres jostle each other from Len Lye's magical advertisement of Shell Oil, The birth of the robot, to Norman McLaren's anti-war classic Hell Unltd, while Elton and Anstey's Housing problems points to the future format of the television documentary."

"Entr'acte. (France, 1923)","""Two men approach a canon and fire it. Rifle-range dummies sway in the wind. A dancing ballerina turns into a strange bearded man. Two men on a roof-top terrace play a game of chess. A funeral procession, moving in slow motion, follows a coffin pulled by a camel. What can it all mean...? This extraordinary early film from director René Clair was originally made to fill an interval between two acts of Francis Picabia's new ballet, Relâche, at the Theatre des Champs-Elyseés in Paris in 1924. Picabia famously wrote a synopsis for the film on one sheet of note paper, headed Maxim's (the famous Parisian restaurant), which he sent to René Clair. This formed the basis for what ultimately appeared on screen, with some additional improvisations. Music for the film was composed by the famous avant-garde composer Erik Satie, who appears in the film, along side its originator, Francis Picabia. The surrealist photographer Man Ray also puts in an appearance, in a film which curiously resembles his own experimental films of this era. Entr'acte is a surrealistic concoction of unrelated images, reflecting Clair's interest in Dada, a fashionable radical approach to visual art which relied on experimentation and surreal expressionism. Clair's imagery is both captivating and disturbing, giving life to inanimate objects (most notably the rifle range dummies), whilst attacking conventions, even the sobriety of a funeral march. When the first performance of Relâche was cancelled because of the ill-health of one of is stars, the public were outraged. There was a belief that Picabia had staged the ultimate Dada stunt - the title of the show means ""respite"" in French. The controversy was laid to rest when the show opened, a few days later than planned. For its part, Clair's Entr'acte won widespread praise, although the response from the paying public was divided. As to what the film actually means, well that's anyone's guess. Like all good surrealist art there are an infinite number of possible interpretations, and one's appreciation and understanding of this film is very much a subjective experience. Themes which appear to dominate the work are death, mortality and the hastening pace of technology. Hence, one possible interpretation is that the film is mocking mankind's attempts to cope with the brevity of his existence. As progress is made, man has to run faster and faster to cram more and more into a fixed duration, his limited lifespan. Could the Entr'acte of the film's title represent that short period of what we call ""life"", that too brief an interval between two acts of an eternal duration?"" [Jim Travers.

Now the mystery can be lifted, since it was released as part of a French DVD(Retour de flamme, by Serge Bromberg's Lobster films) compiling restored shorts and cartoons, and transferred complete with the authentic original musical accompaniment, revealing that the film was in fact intended as an illustration of a song(The title of the film), which was in fact 3 minutes long, and which was recorded in 1930, which is obviously the accurate date for the film as well.

The editing is the essence, involving as it does an infatuation and exploration of the time/movement possibilities of the film. Here is an early example of physical potential being used, the structure being built up from the image content. The repetition of a woman climbing stairs, or the spinning of wheels as a close-up, gives a sense of freedom to the visual motion inherent in the subjects. [Michael J.

Born in Philadelphia in 1890, Man Ray settled in Paris in 1921 to join the Dada movement.

"Man Ray: Prophet of the Avant-garde","Man Ray is the quintessential modernist figure: photographer, painter, object maker and collagist, filmmaker and printmaker, poet, essayist and philosopher. Born Emanuel Radnitsky in 1890, he went on to become the leader of the ""American avant-garde"" and the most enigmatic of the Dada-Surrealists who transformed the Paris art world during the ferment of the 1920's and beyond. This profile follows the creative genius from his youth in Brooklyn to his glory days in Paris and, finally, to his impact on future generations of artists in a variety of fields. Also includes a never-before-seen interview with Man Ray in which he reminisces about his life and work. Based on the book: Man Ray: American artist / Neil Baldwin (Art/Classics N6537.R3.B31 1988 Room 308G; Main Stack N6537.R3.B3 1988)Originally presented as a segment on the PBS television program American masters in 1997. 56 min.

"It's Not My Memory of It: Three Recollected Documents","A documentary about secrecy, memory, and documents. Mobilizing specific historical records as memories which flash up in moments of danger, the tape addresses the expansion and intensification of secrecy practices in the current climate of heightened security. A former CIA source recounts his disappearance through shredded classified documents that were painstakingly reassembled by radical fundamentalist students in Iran in 1979. A CIA film called ""Burial at Sea""--Recorded in 1974 but unacknowledged until 1992 - documents the burial at sea of six Soviet sailors, in a ceremony which collapses Cold War antagonisms in a moment of death and honor. Images pertaining to a publicly acknowledged but top secret U.S. missile strike in Yemen in 2002 are the source of a concluding reflection on the role of documents in the constitution of the dynamic of knowing and not knowing. ""Interviews conducted in July 2000 with Ed Cohen (Office of Information Management, CIA), Steven Garfinkel (Information Security Oversight Office), and Lee Strickland (Information Review Group, CIA).""

Produced by Video Data Bank in collaboration with Electronic Arts Intermix and Bay Area Video Coalition","â€¢149;Jean VigoЖ"
"â€¢149; Program 1, Explorations of Presence, Performance and Audience.","The artists included here moved into video from performance, sculpture, photography, writing and dance. They used the video camera as a mirror, a tool to investigate perception, presenting performative strategies within the paradocically intimate and distanced theater of the video monitor. In most pieces the performer constructs an active relationship with the audience, and the viewer's awareness is specifically acknowledged.","â€¢149;Jean VigoЖ"
"â€¢149; Program 2, Investigations of the Phenomenal World -- Space, Sound, and Light.","In this anthology, the body of the artist functions as one kind of instrument in the presence of, or complicated by, the video and audio recording instruments. Issues of attention such as boredom and exhaustion of both the artist and the audience, are embraced as part of the potential dynamic range of the work. Some of the video projects also propose structural relationships between natural or biological and electronic systems.","â€¢149;Jean VigoЖ"
"â€¢149; Program 3, Approaching Narrative --""There are problems to be solved.""","The works here establish inventive formal staging for epic story-telling. These projects have no interest in seducing an audience into accepting a seamless narrative illusion of reality. Instead, problems are constructed around an audience's understanding of the real and construction of their attention. Audiences have to work to derive meaning from presentations that seek to rupture expectations and also challenge public storytelling and seek to decentralize cultural mythmaking by inventing new forms of theatrical space.","â€¢149;Jean VigoЖ"
"â€¢149; Program 4, Gendered Confrontations.","These feminist video works challenge the reigning but waning modernist and materials-based discourse of the '70s, as well as psychoanalytic theory and the construction of the subject. Video is used to examine one's own life and the experiences of female friends and family, and to question one's own relationship to ""her""/history. As histories of women in the arts and in society are explored, critical attention is also focused onto speculation about the existence of an essential female aesthetic, and the position of women as objects of the (male) gaze.","â€¢149;Jean VigoЖ"
"â€¢149; Program 5, Performance of Video Imaging Tools","In these video pieces artists explore video as an electronic material, and they are interested in the process of translating energy and time into waveforms, frequencies, voltages, and finally into video and audio images. The pieces presented here are documents of dialogues with tools or real-time performances of tools where a video signal is routed through an interface of modifiable electronic instruments.","â€¢149;Jean VigoЖ"
"â€¢149; Program 6, Decentralized Communications Projects.","Generated by artists, public access cable producers, and video collectives, this video anthology marks the efforts of cultural activists to redefine the asymmetrical relationship between transmission and reception, the production and consumption of American television. The introduction of the portapak in the politically-charged late '60s inspired proposals for a radically decentralized information system. By the mid-70's there existed a burgeoning alternative media network of public access cable channels, media art centers, public television stations and a range of independent venues that included pirate TV, media laboratories, and library video programs.","â€¢149;Jean VigoЖ"
"â€¢149; Program 7, Critiques of Art and Media as Commodity and Spectacle.","Through projects that are oppositional to both the economic and attentional structures of broadcast TV, artists target the nature of its spectacle, spellout critical manifestoes, undermine the selection of newsworthy events and public storytelling, and challenge consumers' investment in televisions' cast of heroes and occasional heroines. In these seven films artists re-present television and film images in an effort to reframe them and reconstruct the ideological context that constructs meaning for television viewers.","â€¢149;Jean VigoЖ"
"â€¢149; Program 8, Independents Address Television.","This final segment illustrates how early documentary producers in the 1970's worked to establish relationships with broadcast television that would deliver their independently conceived and produced television to large broadcast audiences. Some saw their challenging projects co-opted by broadcasters, who appropriated independent eye-witnessing as stylistic inventions for television news and dramatic programs. Presented here are 3 samples of early independently produced TV documentaries.","â€¢149;Jean VigoЖ"
"TV as a Creative Medium","In May of 1969, the Howard Wise Gallery in New York presented TV as a Creative Medium, the first exhibition in the United States devoted entirely to video as a form of art.

An off-screen voice, heard only by the audience, gives directions that would help them attain their goal.

"Centers.(1971)","The film was made by Acconci's using the video monitor as a mirror. As we look at the artist sighting along his outstretched arm and forefinger toward the center of the screen what we see is a sustained tautology: a line of sight that begins at Acconci's plane of vision and ends at the eyes of his projected double. The result turns the activity around: a pointing away from the filmaker at an outside viewer.

"Face-off.","This film is an ironic collusion of private and public, of exposure and masking, a tense ritual wherein Acconci divulges and then censors his self-revelations. He turns on an audiotape of his own voice addressing himself and the viewer, recounting intimate details about his life. Whenever the material becomes too personal however, he tries to drown out his voice and prevent the viewer from hearing yelling ""No, no, no, don't tell this!""

"Eija-Liisa Ahtila: The Cinematic Works","Eija-liisa Ahtila's films and cinematic installations experiment with storytelling creating extraordinary tales out of ordinary human experiences. These five films deal with separations, teenage girls' sexuality, relationships among family members, mental disintegration, and death. They investigate the processes of perception and the attribution of meaning, while the installations break down the story and divide it across the exhibition space. The stories are based on interviews and research, the results being transformed into material for the imagination during the scriptwriting process. Seemlessly incorporated into realistic settings using special cinematic techniques, these events give Ahtila's films their distinctive style.

"Peggy Ahwesh Compilation.","From Romance to Ritual (21 min.) -- I Ride a Pony Named Flame (5 min.) -- Martina's Playhouse (20 min.). Three films by Ahwesh, considerably different in style. In From Ritual to Romance, seemingly straightforward vacation movies soon reveal strained interpersonal relationships. In I Ride a Pony Named Flame, performer Margie Strosser assumes a number of disconcerting feminine guises, each branded with a pejorative label which may be ironic. Martina's Playhouse confronts the mostly male-coded tradition of avant-garde home moviemaking. In this psychologically challenging work, mother and young daughter trade places in a fraught dialectic of power and dependency. In between, adult women discuss their sexual desires, their discourse bolstered or thwarted (depending on your outlook) by recitations from Lacan. [Michael J.

Scary movie: Two girls personalize the horror genre with a plot and shot-by-shot structure of their own design, reveling in their ability to reproduce the tropes of horror while, at the same time, taking control of its meaning. She puppet: Lara Croft, the virtual girl-doll of the late 20th century, is recast as a triad of her personas: the alien, the orphan, and the clone in this work based on appropriated footage from the game Tomb Raider. Martina's playhouse: The little girl of the title oscillates from narrator to reader to performer and from the role of baby to that of mother.

Shot in pixelvision, Peggy Ahwesh's tainted soap opera is by visual definition a small world in which minute details are rendered large, with the character's surroundings having prominence but no meaning. 73 suspect words & Heaven's gate: Two text videos from a series that distills to a poetic and symbolic core, a variety of texts, source code, search results, and/or coded messages from the unruly databases that glut the Net.

"Scary Movie(1993)","A ""collaboration with Martina Torr, who by the time the film was shot, was some years older than she was in Martina's Playhouse. Shot in wonderfully high contrast black and white with very low key lighting, the film is one of Ahwesh's most beautiful and most light-hearted; it is also the most reflexive of her many nods towards the horror genre. The film features Martina and co-star/playmate Sonja Mereu. While Martina is costumed in cheap girls' dress up clothes, Sonja has a fake moustache, black gloves and prosthetic monster fingers. The first shot is a repetitive and jerky hand-held pan of a hand drawn music score while the sounds of Psycho-like violins play on the soundtrack. So begins what might be called an anatomising re-reading of the horror genre. The entire soundtrack is a pastiche of music and sounds native to the horror film ï¿½ screams, strings, squeaking doors, footsteps, etc ï¿½ although with a few corny phrases and sound effects that sound as though they've been lifted from a Warner Brothers cartoon. At various points a prosthetic rubber hand (obviously manipulated by a human extending from offscreen space) reaches mock-eerily to caress Martina who pretends to be asleep. Sonja probes/assaults Martina with kitchen tongs and later stabs her repeatedly with a tin-foil knife, and in turn is stabbed by the rubber hand wielding a similar weapon. In the middle of the film's duration, Sonja holds up a poster announcing the credits (she is credited as the 'Doctor/Killer', Martina as the 'Patient/Hand Lover'). Then we see the girls screaming, then dancing. They seem to have escaped their outing into the horror genre. The film ends.""

These short films by Austria's Martin Arnold take brief passages from classic Hollywood cinema (respectively, the films recycle scenes from The Human Jungle and To Kill a Mockingbird), subjecting them to an optical printing process which infuses these banal excerpts with an incessant ""stutter."" Both image and sync sound skip back and forth, creating a staccato rhythm which Arnold himself likens to turntable scratching in hip-hop. By prolonging filmic moments which ordinarily pass in a few seconds, Arnold's films reveal both the abstract choreography and, even more interestingly, the gender coding and politics which lay hidden within the most subtle, least unremarkable gestures.

""A brainy sex flick with a sense of humor, the film begins with a narrator/mummy who guides us through a number of vignettes promising to show what some of us go through in the pursuit of sexual pleasure. There's a fabulous ten minute opening, where the half naked go go dancers have vegetables thrown at them. One of the tales features a female photographer who tortures a male model. Another has a female burglar (Cathy Howard) caught by the house owner. The craziest involves a nerd hiring a blond call girl (Sue Bond) in pursuit of a menage-a-trois with his pet lizard; and there's a endearing misadventure with secret agent Lindy Leigh (Maria Frost) who does topless safecracking.""

"Anticipation of the Night.","One of Brakhage's longest early films, it combines heavily abstracted imagery with an apparent ""narrative"" premise. At the beginning and end of the film, a male figure seen only in shadow, with whom the camera is identified, hangs himself. In the thirty minutes these scenes enframe, we see what in a more traditional feature might be understood as ""life flashing before the eyes."" In this case, however, we more properly witness light flashing before our eyes. Portions of clear imagery emerge -- runs through the woods, low angle views of car trips, nights at the fair -- but the overall impression is one of childhood memory and its prelapsarian state of ""untutored vision"" .

"Double-blind","""In her premiere video project, French conceptual artist Sophie Calle joins with Gregory Shephard to create a voyeuristic tour de force. Armed with camcorders, Calle and her collaborator/partner Shephard head West in his Cadillac convertible to produce and document a real-life narrative of their journey and their relationship. With America as the backdrop for this unconventional coast-to-coast road movie, Calle and Shephard each narrates and records a personal diary, presenting strikingly different versions of the narrative/relationship. Aiming their dueling camcorders, the protagonists chronicle the elusive landscapes of human relations, wrestling to reconcile self, sexuality, and desire. The viewer is challenged to reconsider the subjective and cultural roles imposed by gender, sexuality, power, and tradition. Throughout, Calle seeks to redefine through personal investigation the terms and parameters of subject/object, public/private, truth, fiction, and role-playing. The quasi-documentary style evokes the films of Chris Marker, to whom Double-Blind is dedicated."" [Electronic Arts Intermix catalog] 76 min. 2002.

"Three Transitions","In three short exercises, Campus uses basic techniques of video technology and his own image to create succinct, almost philosophical metaphors for the psychology of the self. In the first ""transition,"" he appears to stab himself in the back, climb through the rupture in his body, and emerge whole on the other side. In the second execise, Campus wipes his face with his hand and ""erases"" its surface--only to reveal another image of his face underneath. Finally in conclusion, he appears to burn the living image of his face (as if it were a photograph), leaving only blackness. 5 min.

"Standish Lawder & Stanley Cavell","A professor of art history and film, a photographer and an inventor, Standish Lawder made truly experimental films by seeing what a predetermined idea about content, structure, or technique will produce when carried out in shooting or printing. Stanley Cavell, philosopher and professor at Harvard, had just published The World Viewed, his first book on film. In this January 1973 episode of Screening Room, Lawder demonstrates the intricacies of his home-made optical printer and shows examples of what can be achieved with rephotographing film. Gardner, Lawder, and Cavell also discuss the intellectual and psychological implications of his manipulations. Their frank commentary carries on over Lawder's test print of Intolerance, which he had just received from the lab and had not yet viewed it himself. Lawder also screens Necrology, Color Film, and Corridor. 1973. 74 min. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eDVD+5880"">DVD 5880Ж","â€¢149;Stanley CavellЖ"

Early formalist works which explore the manipulation ofelectronic color and image density through the camera obscura and image processing devices. In Objects WithDestinations, ordinary objects move in staccato rhythm across the screen, washed with subtle hues. In Windows, the image of windows in a darkened room isdigitized, densely layered, and otherwise abstracted in a series of graphic compositions. In Bathing, Hill transforms the traditional image of a bathing figure by subtly integrating color video and digitized, re-scanned stills. Bits is an abbreviated study of minutiae, textures and patterns, in which Hill explores editing techniques and rhythm. In Mirror Road, Hill creates an increasingly abstracted harmony of landscapes in layered compositions of movement.

"Kiyoko's Situation","Kiyoko's situation articulates the deeply embedded cultural roles of Japanese women through the parallel stories of two female artists, Kiyoko and Tani. In Idemitsu's narrative-within-a-narrative, ""Kiyoko's situation"" is played out on a television monitor within Tani's drama. Tani is paralyzed in her attempts to paint by her feeling that, as a single woman, she has failed in society's eyes. Kiyoko, a young mother viciously criticized by her husband and family for her fierce determination to paint, eventually compromises her art for ""maternal duty."" As Kiyoko complies with the family, Tani, isolated and despairing, is driven to suicide. Idemitsu's chillingly omniscient television monitor, which acts as the psychological ""other,"" metaphorically and literally condemns Tani to death. In the final cruel irony, she hangs herself, using the television monitor as a jumping-off point.

Le Prince applied for patents but the fix was in, leaving Edison and the Lumière Brothers to profit from his invention. He vanished under mysterious circumstances in 1890. Well, that's business, but I'm sure personal malice was not involved. In 1888 he made a number of short recordings.

Beauty = Det schoonheid (1970, 21 min.) -- [3] Even stilte = A moment's silence = Un moment de silence (1960-63, 10 min.) Music by Willem Breuker and others. I [love] money: New York, Geneva, Hong Kong and Amsterdam are major hubs of the world's economy. Great amounts of money circulate there, and whereas poverty is ubiquitous in the streets of New York, Geneva carefully protects its wealth behind impeccable facades. No one is unaffected by the myth of the all-powerful Dollar: the under-privileged struggle to survive talking about their unattainable dream, while businessmen, from the safe distance of their offices, lay down the tenets of the financial philosophy. Beauty: The dream world of a fascist spy named Beauty who destroys himself by attempting to impose a rigid working order on the world. The recurring themes of van der Keuken's work -- time, violence, the perception of reality -- are explored here with exceptional intensity. A moment's silence: One of John van der Keuken's first independent projects produced on an extremely modest budget. The coming and going of street traffic in Amsterdam slows and finally the city is immobilized. In the silence, short live sequences introduce simple poetic observations of a peaceful urban landscape.

Eye above the well: Explores India's spiritual and economic condition, moving from the city to the countryside in the region of Kerala, as it focuses on the essence of that civilization. Captured without commentary by a gliding camera are a cacophony of distinctly nonwestern sights and sounds: the bustling city streets, the serene landscapes of the surrounding countryside, a family preparing for dinner, an elderly actor performing his mythological drama, a modest country moneylender traveling from village to village, young girls at their singing lessons. Lucebert, time and farewell: One of the greatest Dutch poets of the twentieth century, Lucebert was also a major painter who participated in the Cobra movement. This is van der Keuken's acclaimed triptych of three short films on Lucerbert produced in 1962, 1966, and 1994. Unanswered question: A didactic verse on the mechanic (or rather, organic) function of memory and therefore, also on cinema.

Mask: During the celebrations of the bicentennial of the French Revolution, Johan van der Keuken made a film about the revolutionary ideas of equality, liberty, and fraternity. Rather than focusing on the festivities, he lingers on the crowds in the metro and on the platform. Among them is a homeless member of the poor class who is ignored by his more affluent countrymen.

Stanley Cavell, philosopher and professor at Harvard, had just published The World Viewed, his first book on film. In this January 1973 episode of Screening Room, Lawder demonstrates the intricacies of his home-made optical printer and shows examples of what can be achieved with rephotographing film. Gardner, Lawder, and Cavell also discuss the intellectual and psychological implications of his manipulations. Their frank commentary carries on over Lawder's test print of Intolerance, which he had just received from the lab and had not yet viewed it himself.

"A bientôt, j'espère (Be Seeing You)","A film by Chris Marker. From 1967 to 1976 Chris Marker was a member of SLON (the ""Company for the Launching of New Works""), which was based on the idea that cinema should not be thought of solely in terms of commerce. 1967 was also the year an important strike broke out at Rhodiaceta, a textile plant in Besancon, France. Chris Marker and members of SLON visited the city to document the strike and the lives and attitudes of the workers. The film's most important moments are composed of conversations with workers and their wives who believe the working class is at the mercy of a system that would like them to remain powerless. And so it was that their local demands grew to questions about the larger political system. Originally produced in 1968. 39 min.

"La sixièeme face du Pentagone (The Sixth Side of the Pentagon)(1967)","Directed by Chris Marker and Francois Reichenbach. On October 21, 1967, over 100,000 protestors gathered in Washington, D.C., for the Mobilization to End the War in Vietnam. It was the largest protest gathering yet, and it brought together a wide cross-section of liberals, radicals, hippies, and Yippies. Che Guevara had been killed in Bolivia only two weeks previously, and, for many, it was the transition from simply marching against the war, to taking direct action to try to stop the 'American war machine.' From young men burning their draft cards, to the Yippies chanting ""Out, demons, out!,"" to thousands of protestors rushing the steps of the Pentagon itself and some actually getting into the building, this is a remarkable time capsule and reminder of events from forty years ago, 1967-the turning point of opposition to a long and unpopular war. 26 min.

In Surprise Attack, a metal bar is tossed back and forth in Serra's hands while his voice, functioning as a paranoid metaphor, speculates on the nature and limits of self-defense. Anxious Automation involves time-space confusion.

Ekleipsis: Inspired by a New York Times article about a group of hysterically blind Cambodian women in Long Beach, California, known as the largest group of such people in the world. Hysterical blindness is sight loss brought about by traumatic stress. The video delves into two histories: the history of hysteria and the Cambodian civil war, and speaks about the somatization of pain and loss. Alexia: An experimental video about word-blindness and metaphor, with accounts of Giambattista Vico's theory on the origin of language and Ludwig Wittgenstein's theory on aspect-blindness. Word-blindness is a condition that usually afflicts people who have suffered a stroke, causing them to lose the visual recognition of individual letters but perceive the entire word, or vice versa. Amaurosis: A documentary about Dat Nguyen, a blind guitarist living in Little Saigon, Orange County, California. Dat Nguyen was a ""triple outcast"": blind, Amerasian, and an impoverished orphan. The tape strives to present the life of one member from this unique community and promote his rich contributions. Epilogue: the palpable invisibility of life: Visualizes the unseen threads between mother and child, revealing how the ties that bind four generations of women become manifest when a great-grandmother's imploring words tp persevere, passed from granddaughter to great granddaugheter, compel a woman to continue her maternal line by ancient means. 2009. 72 min.","â€¢149;Tran T.
