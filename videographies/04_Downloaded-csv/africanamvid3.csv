"Black Is - Black Ain't: A Personal Journey Through Black Identity","American culture has stereotyped black Americans for centuries. Equally devastating, the late Marlon Riggs argued, have been the definitions of ""blackness"" African Americans impose upon one another which contain and reduce the black experience. In this film, Riggs meets a cross-section of African Americans grappling with the paradox of numerous, often contradictory definitions of blackness. He shows many who have felt uncomfortable and even silenced within the race because their complexion, class, sexuality, gender, or speech has rendered them ""not black enough,"" or conversely, ""too black."" The film scrutinizes the identification of ""blackness"" with masculinity as well as sexism, patriarchy and homophobia in black America. 1995. 88 min.

"Blacking Up: Hip-hop's Remix of Race and Identity","This documentary examines the popularity of hip-hop among America's white youth and asks whether white identification is rooted in admiration and a desire to transcend race or if it is merely a new chapter in the long continuum of stereotyping, mimicry and cultural appropriation. Does it reflect a new face of racial understanding in white America or does it reinforce an ugly history? Against the unique backdrop of american popular music, the film explores racial identity in the United States. The film draws parallels between the white hip-hop fan and previous incarnations of white appropriation from blackface performer Al Jolson to mainstream artists like Elvis Presley, the Rolling Stones and Eminem. It interweaves portraits of white hip-hop artists and fans with insightful commentary by African American cultural critics. 2010 57 min.

"Blacking Up: Hip-hop's Remix of Race and Identity","This documentary examines the popularity of hip-hop among America's white youth and asks whether white identification is rooted in admiration and a desire to transcend race or if it is merely a new chapter in the long continuum of stereotyping, mimicry and cultural appropriation. Does it reflect a new face of racial understanding in white America or does it reinforce an ugly history? Against the unique backdrop of american popular music, the film explores racial identity in the United States. The film draws parallels between the white hip-hop fan and previous incarnations of white appropriation from blackface performer Al Jolson to mainstream artists like Elvis Presley, the Rolling Stones and Eminem. It interweaves portraits of white hip-hop artists and fans with insightful commentary by African American cultural critics. 2010 57 min.

"Didn't We Ramble On.","Film examines how West African people have passed down their rites and spiritual fervor, generation by generation, through the black marching band. As long as 700 years ago, the Yaruba's had musicalprocessions at funerals. By the 17th century, African musicians were seen in Turkish marching bands and admired and copied by the monarchs of Europe. During both World Wars black military bands played a major role in maintaining troop morale. In the U.S. today, the tradition of the black marching band continues on the football fields as exemplified by the Forida A&M Marching Band. In New Orleans today, a jazz procession, a direct cultural link to the Yoruba ceremony of 700 years ago, is an integral part of the Afro-American funeral observance.

Covering more than one hundred years of United States history, traces the evolution of Black American caricatures and stereotypes that have fueled anti-Black prejudice. Loyal Toms, carefree Sambos, faithful Mammies, grinning Coons, savage Brutes and wide-eyed Pickaninnies roll across the screen in cartoons, feature films, popular songs, advertisements, household artifacts, even children's rhymes. These caricatures permeated popular culture from the 1820s to the Civil Rights era and implanted themselves within the American psyche. 1986. 57 min.

"Faubourg Tremé: The Untold Story of Black New Orleans","During slavery, Faubourg Treme was home to the largest community of free black people in the Deep South and a hotbed of political ferment. Here black and white, free and enslaved, rich and poor co-habitated, collaborated, and clashed to create much of what defines New Orleans culture up to the present day. The neighborhood developed during French rule and many families like the Trevignes kept speaking French as their first language until the late 1960s. Treme was the home of the Tribune, the first black daily newspaper in the US. During Reconstruction, activists from Treme pushed for equal treatment under the law and for integration. And after Reconstruction's defeat, a ""Citizens Committee"" legally challenged the resegregation of public transportation resulting in the infamous Plessy vs.Ferfuson Supreme Court case. Shot largely before Hurricane Katrina and edited afterwards, the film is both celebratory and elegiac in tone. Directed by Dawn Logsdon; written & co-directed by Lolis Eric Elie. 2007. 68 min.

"A Portrait of Jason.","""Filmed in one wild night at New York’s Chelsea Hotel, Shirley Clarke’s explosive Portrait of Jason is a landmark of nonfiction film – the combination of a visionary director, a complex and enigmatic subject, and a moment of new cinematic and social possibilities. Jason Holliday is an unapologetically gay cabaret performer with charisma to spare, a knack for drama, and a life that’s provided him with plenty of stories to tell – about racism, homophobia, parental abuse, show business, drugs, sex, prostitution, the law, and whatever else he can think of while the cameras are rolling. Jason is endlessly entertaining – he sings, tells his stories, performs, breaks down, gets back up, keeps going. But he is as elusive as he is talented, and the more intimate the details he reveals, the less clear his ""identity"" becomes. As the night goes on he plays an increasingly intense game of cat-and-mouse with the filmmakers, who can be heard egging him on from behind the camera. The climax of the film is a shocking attempt by the crew to break through the layers of Jason's charisma to reveal the person underneath."" A film by Shirley Clarke. 1967. 105 min.
