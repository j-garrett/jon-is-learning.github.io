She abandons the corporal who in a fit of jealous rage stabs her. Contains much singing and dancing with Bizet's score replaced with indigenous Senegalese music and choreography.

"The Colonial Friend (L'ami y'a bon) (Germany / France, 1997)","Directed by Rachid Bouchareb. ""Rachid Bouchareb's indelible and haunting short film The Colonial Friend is a muted, yet thoughtful and compelling true historical account of the 1944 massacre by the French army of indigenous African soldiers who sought to collect wages for their military service. Centered on a Cameroonian farmer, Abi, who, like many able-bodied indigenous men from colonized territories, leaves his family to heed the patriotic call for conscription into the French armed forces during the early 1940s as part of the nation's war campaign against the Germans, he serves with distinction during the war, fighting - and often dying - alongside French and colonized soldiers in the battlefield until he is captured and interned when France falls into the hands of the Germans. Eventually repatriated at the end of the war, Abi briefly returns to his family before rejoining his fellow Senegalese veterans to demand their unpaid wages at Camp de Thiaroye, a peaceful protest that soon turns deadly when the French army turns its armaments towards its own soldiers to force their evacuation from the military installation. Elegantly (and incisively) rendered in two-tone (black and red), pencil sketch animation, Bouchareb understatedly, but effectively presents a pervasive image of subtle, yet omnipresent division and differentiation that continues to surface despite the perpetuated myth of colonial assimilation and enlightened occupation.""

"Sankofa. (1993)","Directed by Haile Gerima. Cast: Kofi Ghanaba, Oyafunmike Ogunlano, Alexandra Duah, Nick Medley, Mutabaruka, Afemo Omilami, Reginald Carter, Mzuri. Sankofa is an Akan word that means, ""We must go back and reclaim our past so we can move forward; so we understand why and how we came to be who we are today."" Written, directed and produced by Ethiopian-born filmmaker Haile Gerima, SANKOFA is a powerful film about Maafa-the African holocaust. Done from an African/African-American perspective, this story is a vastly different one from the generally distorted representations of African people that Hollywood gives us. This revolutionary feature film connects enslaved black people with their African past and culture. It empowers Black people on the screen by showing how African peoples' desire for freedom made them resist, fight back, and conspire against their enslavers, overseers and collective past through the vision on Mona, who visits her ancestral experience on a new world planation as Shola. We share the life she endures as a slave and experiences her growing consciousness and transformation [description from web site]. 1993. 125 min. ; ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eDVD+X4821"">DVD X4821Ж, Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/evhs+999:1596"">vhs 999:1596Ж","â€¢149;Ѭ href=""http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0108041/"">Credits and other information from the Internet Movie DatabaseЖ
