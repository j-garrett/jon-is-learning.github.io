"Liberia: An Uncivil War","Provides an in-depth case study of one of the many brutal civil wars that have sprung up across Africa. It is also an exciting example of war-time journalism--harrowing reporting with bullets ricocheting just feet from the camera--placed in a historical context stretching back nearly two hundred years. Reporter Jonathan Stack is besieged in the Liberian capital of Monrovia where President Charles Taylor says he will not leave until peacekeepers are in place. James Barbazon, embedded with The LURD (Liberians United For Reconcilation and Democracy) who have pledged to pillage the country until President Taylor leaves, introduces General Cobra, Col. Black Diamond and other soldiers, slightly more than children. On August 5th 2003 - with the rebels at the bridges leading to Monrovia, the Nigerians are at last persuaded to send 750 peacekeepers and the U.N. soon follows with 14,000. But what remains in the viewer's mind is President Bush's empty promises of help during the darkest days of Liberia's civil war. Produced and directed by Jonathan Stack. 2004. 102 min.

During the 1990s, non-governmental organizations such as the World Food Program distributed seeds and farm tools to the poor, and the government allowed them to live and farm on public land.

Four television shorts produced in four different African countries to be shown on the African television series Africa Dreaming. In Sophia's Homecoming (Namibia) a woman who has worked as a domestic returns home to a terrible discovery: the ruptures caused by apartheid can never be repaired. In Sabriya (Tunisia) a modern woman disrupts the patterned mosaic of male Maghrebi society. So Be It (Senegal), based on a play by Wole Soyinka, follows the destruction of a well intentioned foreign doctor confronting fear, rage and powerlessness in a remote Senegalese village. The Gaze of the Stars (Mozambique) is a story about machismo in Mozambique, so powerful that it drives away whatever it loves. 1997. 112 min.

"Milking the Rhino","A ferocious kill on the Serengeti; warnings about endangered species... These clichés of nature films ignore a key landscape feature: villagers just off-camera who endure the dangers and costs of living with wild animals. The Maasai tribe of Kenya and Namibia's Himba -- two of earth's oldest cattle cultures -- are emerging from a century of 'white man's conservation,' which threw them off their lands, banned subsistence hunting and fueled resentment. They are discovering that earnings from wildlife tourism can rival the benefits of livestock. But change is not easy. Charting the collision of ancient ways with Western expectations, this film offers complex, intimate stories of Africans at the forefront of community-based conservation. Directed, produced, written and edited by David E. Simpson. Dist.: Ѭ href=""http://www.kartemquin.com/"">Kartemquin FilmsЖ. 2008. 83 min.

Malnutrition remains the main cause of maternal and infant mortality, and over half of all pregnant women suffer from iron deficiency anemia.

"School's Out! (Life; 5)","Explores the issue of private versus public schools in Makoko, a shantytown in Lagos, Nigeria. Average income in Makoko is about fifty dollars a month. The people of Makoko appear to have a choice: Children can go to the free state school, or they can pay at one of a growing number of small, private schools that have opened there. Research into how and why these private schools have emerged in such unlikely circumstances has been organized by a team from the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Their research reveals that in communities like Makoko, parents are voting with their feet. They think the state system has failed, and a new and interesting grass roots movement in education seems to be the result. Produced and directed by Dick Bower. 23 min.

Everywhere he encountered the jihad or holy war.

"Darwin's Nightmare","Documentary film that exposes the poverty and misery of people living on the shores of Lake Victoria in Tanzania who are dependent upon fishing the Nile perch from the lake for their meager earnings. The fish are exported by air to Europe to be sold cheaply and the planes that arrive to transport the fish at first seem to arrive empty, but turn out to carry weapons to Africa and fish away.
""Some time in the 1960's, in the heart of Africa, a new animal was introduced into Lake Victoria as a little scientific experiment. The Nile Perch, a voracious predator, extinguished almost the entire stock of the native fish species. However, the new fish multiplied so fast, that its white fillets are today exported all around the world. Huge hulking ex-Soviet cargo planes come daily to collect the latest catch in exchange for their southbound cargo? Kalashnikovs and ammunitions for the uncounted wars in the dark center of the continent. This booming multinational industry of fish and weapons has created an ungodly globalized alliance on the shores of the world?s biggest tropical lake: an army of local fishermen, World bank agents, homeless children, African ministers, EU-commissioners, Tanzanian prostitutes and Russian pilots.""

"The Donor Circus.(Life; 5)","Looks at the economic situation in Zambia and how foreign aid is being utilized by the Zambian government and non-governmental organizations.

There are many individual NGOs in Zambia involved in local projects, independent from government and funded directly by international donors. But now the government is arguing that it should be in control of dispersing all international development aid. The days of individual donors funding individual projects could be a thing of the past.
