"How Men Propose(1913)","Directed by Lois Weber. Cast: Chester Barnett, Margarita Fischer, Grace Darling, Phillips Smalley. ""How Men Propose illustrates Lois Weber's interest in male-female relationships, even in this early comic short. Structured around repetition and reversal, the comedy shows its heroine entertaining multiple marriage proposals from different suitors, each unaware of the other. If at first the humor seems to revolve around the heroine?s fickleness, those assumptions are reversed in the final scene. There we learn she is a professional journalist studying how men propose and wisely exploiting the men's willingness to be fooled by her feminine charms. By keeping viewers unaware of the heroine's motives until the end, the film challenges expectations about conventional male and female behavior.""

"Baby Face (1933)","Directed by Alfred E. Green. Cast: Barbara Stanwyck, George Brent, Donald Cook, Alphonse Ethier, Henry Kolker, Theresa Harris, Margaret Lindsay, Arthur Hohl, John Wayne. It's the age-old story of the girl so mistreated by men that she's determined to get revenge. Lilly (Baby Face) sleeps her way from basement speakeasy bartender, literally floor by floor, to the top floor of a New York office building. Bank submanager Jimmy McCoy finds her a job in the bank only to be cast aside as she hooks up with the bank's president. ""The Hays office recommended that the picture be pulled from the theaters for its violations of the production code. ...There was extensive correspondence between officials of the AMPP and Warner Bros. executives Darryl Zanuck and Jack L. Warner regarding various changes which were intended to make the film more acceptable to censor boards across the country. The main thrust of the changes was to attach an ending which showed Lily losing everything she had gained and returning to her hometown in order that viewers would not be tempted to believe that vice was rewarded. Originally the character of the cobbler professed a Nietzchian philosophy which was unacceptable under the production code. The character was changed to become instead the moral voice of the film, and was used to indicate that the character of Lily had been wrong to advance in the by using her body. Also cut were the most blantant references to the fact that Lily was being kept by men.""

"Female (1933)","Directed by Michael Curtiz. Cast: Ruth Chatterton, George Brent, Lois Wilson, Johnny Mack Brown, Ruth Donnelly. In director Michael Curtiz's romantic comedy Female, Ruth Chatterton plays Alison Drake, the iron-fisted president of a motorcar company. Alison oversees the daily operations of her male employees with a predatory gaze and frequently exercises her right to engage with them in any way she deems fit. She meets her match in an equally strong-minded new employee, Jim Thorne (George Brent), and the two engage in a smoldering, contentious, sexually charged duel. The action of the film--one of the first to depict a female character turning a man's world to her advantage--feeds on the novelty of presenting a woman as a corporate shark and bedroom hound. Though it's obvious the filmmakers thought they were creating a scenario that would never actually happen, Alison's world-smashing exploits make the bulk of the film (before she begins to question her nontraditional lifestyle) a protofeminist romp. Brent and Chatterton were married at the time they made the film, and the natural chemistry between them is abundantly evident. Curtiz packs the screen with extravagant set design and period detail. 60 min.

"I'm No Angel (1933)","Directed by Wesley Ruggles. Cast: Mae West, Cary Grant, Edward Arnold, Gregory Ratoff. The bold Tira works as a dancing beauty and lion tamer at a fair. Out of an urgent need of money, she agrees to a risky new number: she'll put her head into the lion's mouth! With this attraction the circus makes it to New York and Tira can persue her dearest occupation: flirting with rich men. Among the guys she searches for the love of her life, from whom she only knows from a fortune-teller that he'll be rich and have black hair. When she finally meets him, she becomes a victim of intrigue. ""West, more imposing than coquettish as Tira the Lion Tamer, wields physical presence like a boxer and sexuality like a gunslinger throughout the film. From her opening scene, where she's introduced to a carnival crowd as ""the girl who discovered you don't need feet to be a dancer,"" until the end, when she gets her man (Cary Grant, 29 years old and looking about 14, as upstanding society fellow Jack Clayton), Tira owns the screen. It's not hard to imagine either why I'm No Angel, often considered the last film of pre-code Hollywood, was the breaking straw for the Hays Office, or why Depression-era audiences loved it so much. Tira violates conventions of race, class, and (of course) sex, and she goes entirely unpunished by the plot of the film. Instead, West, who took sole credit for the story, screenplay and dialogue, is careful to give herself the last laugh--the real currency of a film like this one--in every scene. In the climactic trial, she cross-examines much of her romantic history to prove, to a judge and jury with whom she flirts hilariously, that she's ""no angel"" but that she is, indisputably, a heroine. Here at SFist, we are hard pressed to think of a recent studio film in which a hypersexual female lead gets away with so much.""

"She Done Him Wrong (1933)","Directed by Lowell Sherman. Cast: Mae West, Cary Grant, Owen Moore, Noah Beery, Gilbert Roland. Mae West as Lady Lou, a toughlady with a heart of gold, who dallys with assorted beaus, becomes entangled in murder, saves a Bowery mission and still has enough energy left to belt out a tune or two! ""Is that a gun in your pocket or are you just glad to see me?"" One of the lines that got Mae West in hot water and a Depression-stricken Paramount into the black, in Mae's blockbuster adaptation of her stage hit ""Diamond Lil,"" with Salvation Army captain Cary Grant as the hunk she asks to ""come up and see me sometime.""
""Mae West spent her career on the stage and screen skirting and sometimes transgressing the boundaries of sexual and moral propriety. In 1926 and 1927, she outraged some critics (and landed herself in jail) with two sensational Broadway productions, Sex (a play she wrote about a Montreal prostitute, in which she also starred) and The Drag (a 'homosexual comedy-drama' that she wrote and staged). In 1928, New York police arrested her again, this time for her play about a troupe of female impersonators, Pleasure Man. In 1932, she brought her brand of ribald humor to the movies. West's move from Broadway to Hollywood was surprising, given the substantially tighter moral scrutiny under which the film industry operated.""

Stories about three very different women and the men they attract. Adelina sells black-market cigarettes in Naples, is married to the unemployed Carmine, and faces a jail sentence. She can avoid it as long as she's pregnant. Several years and seven children later, Carmine is exhausted, so jail looks inescapable as does her contempt for Carmine. In Milan, Anna drives a Rolls, is bored, and picks up a writer. She talks dreamily of running off with him until he dents her car; that gets her emotional attention. Mara, a Roman call girl, turns the head of a naive seminarian, prompting a run-in with his granny and a vow of abstinence. Mara's fizzy lover from Bologna grows impatient. 120 min. ; ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eDVD+5534"">DVD 5534Ж, Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/evhs+999:2430"">vhs 999:2430Ж","â€¢149;Ѭ href=""http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0057171"">Credits and other information from the Internet Movie DatabaseЖ

"Little Vera (Malenkaya Vera) (Soviet Union 1988)","Directed by Vasily Pichul. Cast: Natalya Negoda, Andrei Sokolov, Yuri Nazarov, Lyudmila Zajtseva, Aleksandr Negreba, Aleksandra Tabakova. The title character of the Russian Little Vera is a headstrong teenage girl, played by Natalya Negoda. To the dismay of her parents, Vera lives only for the moment, making no provision for her future. She'd rather hang out at local cafes in garish makeup and provocative clothing. A chance meeting with handsome student Sergei (Andrei Sokolov) develops into a sexual relationship. Her parents send out Vera's brother (Alexander Alexeyev-Negreba) to talk some sense into her. This proves doubly dicey when it turns out that the brother is an old acquaintance of the rebellious Sergei. Vera lies that she's gotten pregnant by Sergei, so he obligingly marries her and moves in with her family, which serves only to make matters worse. Vera's drunken father (Yuri Nazarov) ends up stabbing his son-in-law. Persuaded to lie about the incident to keep her father out of jail, Vera takes her family's side. A last-minute tragedy is barely averted, but we get the distinct feeling that Vera's problems with her family in particular and her life in general are far from over [synopsis from Ѭ href=""http://allmovie.com/"">All-Movie GuideЖ] 110 min. ; ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eDVD+8369"">DVD 8369Ж, Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/evhs+999:379"">vhs 999:379Ж","â€¢149;Ѭ href=""http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0095574/"">Credits and other information from the Internet Movie DatabaseЖ

"McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971)","Directed by Robert Altman. Cast: Warren Beatty, Julie Christie, Rene Auberjonois, Hugh Millais, Shelly Duvall. ""What many consider to be Robert Altman's best film is a western, set in some wild, frozen corner of the Northwest Territory, where somehow there exists the shanty town of Presbyterian Church. And an itinerant, bluffing gambler named John McCabe (Warren Beatty). And a professional whore and realist named Mrs. Miller (Julie Christie) with whom McCabe has both a business relationship and something akin to love. And a host of miners and prostitutes whose mumbled reveries and half-expressed movements reflect the tenuousness of life in a precariously built town barely able to protect them from the changing seasons (superbly captured by Vilmos Zsigmond's photography) and politics. It's a western, but an Altman western, filled with Altman humor, Altman moods and Altman absurdities. When McCabe goes out to face the mining company's hired guns, it's morning, not High Noon, and Mrs. Miller, the realist, has already retreated to the sure indifference of the opium pipe""--Pacific Film Archive film note. 121 min. ; ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eDVD+1275"">DVD 1275Ж, Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/evhs+999:419"">vhs 999:419Ж","â€¢149;Ѭ href=""http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0067411/"">Credits and other information from the Internet Movie DatabaseЖ
