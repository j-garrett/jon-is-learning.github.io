"Simon of the Desert (Simón del Desierto) (Mexico, 1965)","Directed by Luis Buñuel. Cast Claudio Brook, Silvia Pinal, Enrique Alvarez Felix, Hortensia Santoveña, Francisco Reiguera, Luis Aceves Castañeda, Enrique Garcia Alvarez, Antonio Bravo, Enrique del Castillo, Eduardo MacGregor. Buñuel's bizarre, very off-beat film based loosely on the life of the 5th century saint, Simeon Stylites. Simon has stood on top of a pillar in the desert for six years, six weeks and six days. His saintliness and denial prompts the Devil to try and tempt him in a variety of guises (all of them female). A bizarre conclusion, with a hint of nuclear catastrophe waiting in the wings, rounds things off quite nicely in this off-beat film. Special DVD features: A Mexican Buñuel (1997), a 50 min. documentary by Emilio Maillé ; new interview with actress Silvia Pinal ; new and improved subtitle translation; new essay by Michael Wood and a reprint interview with Buñuel. 45 min. ; ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eDVD+X1133"">DVD X1133Ж, Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/evhs+999:165"">vhs 999:165Ж","â€¢149;Ѭ href=""http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0059719/"">Credits and other information from the Internet Movie DatabaseЖ
