"American President","2000. 60 min. each installment","â€¢149; Part l: Matter of Destiny: Family Ties The last thing that the Founding Fathers envisioned was a hereditary chief executive. Yet, power inevitably passes from generation to generation and several families have returned to the White house. Focusing on John Q. Adams, Benjamin Harrison, Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy, part 1 reveals both the blessings and the curses of inherited power. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+7161"">Video/C 7161Ж","â€¢149; Part 2: Matter of Destiny: Happenstance. Nearly one in five American presidents has died in office. The vice presidents who succeeded them were often chosen for the ticket less because they were equal to the task than because they provided some electoral advantage. Focusing on John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Andrew Jackson, Chester Arthur and Harry Truman, part 2 looks at what happens when such a man takes office -- frequently facing widespread conviction that he is unworthy. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+7161"">Video/C 7161Ж","â€¢149; Part 3: Politics and the Presidency: an Independent Cast of Mind Is an independent mind the best approach to the presidency? The four men profiled in this segment took little account of political affiliation, becoming presidents, in essence without being politicians. Taken together, they present a cautionary tale: all had difficult presidencies, and neither of the two who sought a second term was re-elected. This segment profiles the careers of J. Adams, Taylor, Hayes, and Carter. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+7162"">Video/C 7162Ж","â€¢149; Part 4: Politics and the Presidency: The Professional Politician In our nation's early years, taking part in political affairs was considered a duty and an honor, but not a way of life. It was not long, however, before the professional politicians, and the parties they represented, began to find their way to the White House. While the skills necessary for political success can be helpful to a president, they do not guarantee success. This segment profiles the careers of Van Buren, Buchanan, Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+7162"">Video/C 7162Ж","â€¢149; Part 5: Executive Vision: The American Americans have come to expect that their presidents will bring to the office a particularly strong sense of national mission. The four presidents chronicled here may have understood the character of America in different ways, but in all cases a belief that there was a distinctly American way of doing things guided their decisions. This segment profiles the careers of Jefferson, Coolidge, Hoover and Reagan. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+7163"">Video/C 7163Ж","â€¢149; Part 6: Executive Vision: The World Stage The president has no greater responsibility than representing the nation on the world stage. These four men engaged in this task at critical times in American national history and their achievements on the world stage stand as their most durable legacy. This segment profiles the careers of Monroe, McKinley, Wilson and Bush. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+7163"">Video/C 7163Ж","â€¢149; Part 7: The Candidate: The Heroic Posture From the beginning, the presidential office has beckoned to national heroes renowned for their selfless service to their country. This affinity is especially strong for men of military fame, for the president is formally the commander-in-chief as well as symbolically the steward of the national interest. This segment profiles the careers of Washington, W. H. Harrison, Grant, and Eisenhower. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+7164"">Video/C 7164Ж","â€¢149; Part 8: The Candidate: Compromise Choices With the rise of political parties came the dawn of political compromise: nominees were selected because they were less offensive to some voters than those who might have been the best candidates. Two of the men profiled in this segment found the presidency beyond their abilities, while two proved themselves worthy of having been called to the highest office in the land. This segment profiles the careers of Pierce, Garfield, Harding and Ford.

These four presidencies are benchmarks in the development of executive power. Three stretched the office to its limits; the fourth over-stepped those limits and brought on a new era of presidential weakness. This segment profiles the careers of Jackson, Cleveland, T. Roosevelt and Nixon. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+7165"">Video/C 7165Ж","â€¢149; Part 10: An Office and its Powers:The Balance of Power The American presidency was conceived as one part of a larger system of institutions, and its effectiveness rests in part upon a good measure of cooperation among the branches. This episode examines presidential leadership in eras of an increasingly divided government. The presidents presented here suggest four different conceptions of governance within a constitutionally structured balancing act. This segment profiles the careers of Madison, Polk,Taft and Clinton.

"America's War on Poverty.","â€¢149; Vol 1: In This Affluent Society. In the early 1960s, hundreds of Kentucky coal miners are displaced by machines and strike out at their former employers. Millions of others displaced by machines across Appalachia and the rural South head north to begin a new life in Chicago, where they face overcrowded tenements and schools, and the familiar inequities of segregation. This program recounts these stories of desperation and hope and explores the origins of the federal government's war on poverty and how attitudes toward race and faith in the accessibility of the American dream shape the battle plans for the nation's greatest effort to reduce poverty. 57 min.

Early 1965 is a critical period for President Johnson's war on poverty. The Office of Economic Opportunity's goal to have the poor themselves design and run anti-poverty programs attracts strong opposition from local and state governments. Head Start is created to provide poor children with adequate nutrition, health care and the educational advantages that other American children enjoy. This program focuses on the Head Start program in Mississippi. 57 min.

The context for the war on poverty shifts after 1965. Urban rebellions provoke a sense of urgency for some, while others now see the war against poverty as hopeless. Increasingly, the media and the public equate poverty with inner-city black communities. This program looks at the anger and despair of the poor and the powerless, and the anger and frustration of the middle class at having to pay for ""others' mistakes."" It also examines attempts made in Newark, New Jersey, to reclaim the inner city through public/private partnerships. 57 min.

By 1967, poverty warriors increase the sophistication of their tactics at the same time that a number of outspoken opponents rise to national prominence. This program highlights the beginning of Legal Services and VISTA, two programs that combined individual action with the idea of volunteerism. Lawyers team up with migrant farm workers in California to fight for better education, health care and working conditions, and VISTA volunteers and local residents organize against strip mining in Appalachia. Both stories raise significant questions about activities the government funds in the name of fighting poverty. 57 min.

The Nixon Administration and the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO) bring the nation to the brink of overhauling the federal social security system and replacing welfare with a guaranteed income for all citizens.

"[Bush, George W.] George W.

Prior to winning the presidency, George Bush served as a U.S. congressman, ambassador to the United Nations, chairman of the Republican National Committee, chief of the U.S. Liaison Office to China, director of the C.I.A, and vice president under Ronald Reagan. Despite soaring approval ratings following military victory in the Persian Gulf, his years as president after the war were marked by unrelieved decline. As the economy faltered and a recession set in, the supply-side economic policies of the 1980s were questioned and Bush was forced to break his promise of ""no new taxes."" Further damaging his chances for reelection was the impression that he was more concerned with world affairs than the problems vexing Main Street, USA.

"Constructing Public Opinion: How Politicians and the Media Misrepresent the Public","The media regularly use public opinion polls in their reporting of important news stories. But how exactly do they report them and to what end? In this interview, Professor Justin Lewis demonstrates the way in which polling data are themselves used by media to not just reflect what Americans think but instead to construct public opinion itself. Addressing issues such as the role the media play in ""manufacturing consent"" for political elites, what polls really tell us about public opinion, and what Americans actually think about politics, the program provides a new way to think about the relationship between politics, mediaand the public. 2001. 31 min.

While campus evangelists go head-to-head with campus radicals Billy Graham and Richard Nixon join forces to champion ""The Silent Majority."" Watergate soon teaches Graham the perils of political entanglement. But the die has been cast, and in Kanawha County, West Virginia--where a local textbook controversy escalates into jailings, bombings and a miners' strike--the Religious Right is born.

When Presidential candidate Jimmy Carter declares himself ""born again"", the media is befuddled--but his religious faith helps convince voters he can heal the nation. 1976 heralds a new era for evangelicals in every arena, yet modern life also means divorce, feminism, and gay rights. At the White House Conference on Families, conservative Christians choose polarization on those issues over reuniting the American family. Narrator: Cliff Robertson.

Seizing the pro-family agenda, New Right conservative strategists midwife a brood of new Christian political organizations, most notably Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority. These groups experience a heady overnight success, registering millions of evangelical voters and helping sweep Ronald Reagan into office. Yet once in the White House, his mainline Republican advisors actively suppress the traditional values issues. Evangelical leaders are forced to choose between 'speaking the truth' and 'going along to get along' in the political realm. Narrator: Cliff Robertson.

Anti-abortion activists cheered when Reagan named one of their own, C. Everett Koop, as Surgeon General. By the mid-80s, though, AIDS hits home even in fundamentalists circles and Koop splits with his former allies over the proper Christian response to this 'sign of God's judgement.' Pat Robertson mobilizes an 'invisible army' to support his bid for the presidency.

While George Bush strains to win their trust, religious leaders turn to a new crusade: building a true grassroots power structure from the ashes of the Robertson campaign. The fruit of their efforts, the Christian Coalition, is now one of most politically adept membership organizations ever. Yet many inside the movement question if, in gaining power in the secular world, conservative Christians have lost their evangelical soul.

"[Ford, Gerald] Gerald Ford's America","Scrutinizes the ""first one hundred days"" of the Ford presidency. In Part 1 WIN (the title refers to the slogan ""Whip Inflation Now""), the TVTV crew follows Ford on a goodwill tour of his old constituency in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Having promised to end the ""national nightmare"" of Vietnam and Watergate, Ford took office only to face inflation and a looming recession. Ironically contrasting political rhetoric with the reality of working and middle-class America, TVTV juxtaposes a main point of Ford's platform -- that Americans should curb their spending habits -- with a GOP fundraiser in which wealthy patrons bid extravagantly for a football once held by Ford. In Part 2 Chick to sheik, the filmmakers examine the assertion that political deal-making occurs at the social level, they take careful note of the high cost of entertaining: $10,000 for one diplomatic function. As an ironic footnote to history, the tape culminates in a party for the Shah of Iran at the Iranian Embassy, complete with birthday toasts to the soon-to-be-ousted ruler.
