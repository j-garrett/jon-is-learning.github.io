"Dress to Kill","Directed by Lawrence Jordan. Eddie Izzard spins free-flowing jokes about San Francisco, transvestitism, squirrels, American optimism, Hitler, the British royal family, mass murder and Stonehenge. Izzard romps through human history and transforms surprisingly complex ideas into biting satire--as well as knockout bits of sublime frivolity, like describing the movie Speed entirely in French. 1998. 180 min.

"Freeheld","Detective Lieutenant Laurel Hester spent 25 years investigating tough cases in Ocean County, New Jersey, protecting the rights of victims and putting her life on the line. She had no reason to expect that in the last year of her life, after she was diagnosed with terminal cancer, that her final battle for justice would be for the woman she loved. The film chronicles Laurel's struggle to transfer her earned pension to her domestic partner, Stacie Andree. With less than six months to live, Laurel refuses to back down when her elected officials -- the Ocean County Freeholders -- deny her request to leave her pension to Stacie, an automatic option for heterosexual married couples. The film is structured chronologically, following both the escalation of Laurel's battle with the Freeholders and the decline of her health as cancer spreads to her brain. Directed by Cynthia Wade. Special features: 100 additional minutes of never-before-seen footage, including: Oscar Day: Behind the Scenes, The Making of Freeheld, Laurel and Stacie's Video Diary, Laurel's Childhood, Communities Respond to Freeheld. 2007. 140 min.

The film works on many levels to reposition the mythic tale of the Beatles boy's life by casting '80's women in mod drag, effectively mapping the lesbian sub-culture onto heterosexual mass culture. Discounting the importance of historical accuracy, Dougherty gives an incisive reading of the creation of pop culture icons with John Lennon portrayed as a projection of our society's collective needs and desires. 1989. 40 min.

"The Homosexuals (CBS Report)","A CBS Reports program that underscores the difference between modern (1966) sexual morals and those of the dominant culture. Mike Wallace attempts to give even-handed treatment to a subject very much taboo at the time by concluding that homosexuality is most probably a disease, mainly a male phenomenon, involving those incapable of maintaining deep and long lasting relationships. Gore Vidal makes an appearance and sounds a modern tone in the depths of this 40-year old stopped time piece, but his insights and observations are cut into pieces amidst much broader coverage of insistent anti-homosexual psychologists on the one hand and shadowy interviews with male homosexuals. A media history landmark produced in the same New York City that three years later saw the Stonewall riots that began the modern era of gay power activism. 1966. 44 min.

In Marshmallows, Jack tells a funny, pathetic tale ""on"" himself--a nightmare of failing to catch Mekas--called variously ""Uncle Artcrust,"" ""Uncle Fishhook"" and sometimes ""Old Uncle Oldie""--in the act of duplication."" [description from Ѭ href=""http://www.facets.org/"">FACETS catalogЖ] Also includes Ron Vawter's performs portrayal of a classic Roy Cohn after-dinner speech for the Society for the Protection of the American Family.

'These two men, who had nothing in common except their death from AIDS in the late '80s, are resurrected by Vawter and Godmilow in a constrast of stance, from which is born, little by little, a sensation of undoing, of sadness, of finitude' (La Stampa)."" 1998. 90 min. ; Roy Cohn/Jack Smith also on ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+7682"">Video/C 7682Ж, Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eDVD+X3479"">DVD X3479Ж","Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender,

"Regretters","Regretters gives heartfelt voice to two transgendered people who underwent sex change surgery to become women. Now, years later, they would like to return to their original, masculine selves. Through their experiences we learn how very complicated gender identity is; morphing from one gender to another is not accomplished solely by sexual reassignment surgery. Orlando and Mikael are Swedish, now in their sixties. Meeting for the first time, they face one another on a stage and engage in a spontaneous dialogue. Orlando, an androgynous dandy dressed in a red velvet suit, had one of the first sex change operations in Sweden in 1967. He tells of his eleven year marriage to a man who never suspected that his wife had not been born female. Mikael, dressed as a man, underwent the surgery in the 1990's when he was fifty years old. He has tried to convince his doctors to change him back, as he feels desperately lost between genders, trapped inside a body that is not his. Written & directed by Marcus Lindeen. 2010. 60 min.
