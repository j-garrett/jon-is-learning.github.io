"Age of Hope, 1900 (People's Century).","The dawn of the twentieth century was forged in hope and optimism. Here interviewees from Europe, Asia and the United States (boasting an average age of 102), recount the part they played in the century's early history. Whether fighting on the barricades of the failed Russian Revolution of 1905 or campaigning for votes for women; recalling the Paris Exposition of 1900, or President McKinley's assassination or witnessing the sinking of the Titanic, all remember the changes they lived through and the clash of forces and ideas before World War I. 1998. 56 min.

"The Cold War. 1998. 47 min. each installment.","â€¢149;Comrades, 1917-1945. Though ideological enemies, the Soviet Union and the United States are allies against Hitler during WWII. At the end of the war, Europe is divided, and the one-time allies now confront each other knowing that the United States has the atomic bomb. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+5735"">Video/C 5735Ж","â€¢149;Iron Curtain, 1945-1947. The Soviet Union dominates Eastern Europe. Churchill warns of the consequences. Stalin insists that the governments of the Soviet Union's client states be pro-communist. Impoverished after the war, Great Britain opts out as a world power. The United States assumes the mantle of world leadership. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+5735"">Video/C 5735Ж","â€¢149; Marshall Plan, 1947-1952. The United States adopts the Truman doctrine, pledging to defend freedom worldwide. Secretary of State George Marshall plans to bolster economic recovery in Europe. Seeing this as a threat, Stalin forbids his satellites to participate. The world effectively divides. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+5735"">Video/C 5735Ж","â€¢149;Berlin, 1948-1949 In Berlin, the American, British and French sectors form a Western enclave in the Soviet zone of divided Germany. In June 1948, the Soviets blockade the city, but the Western allies successfully airlift in supplies. In August 1949, Soviet scientists explode an atomic bomb, establishing nuclear parity between the two superpowers. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+5736"">Video/C 5736Ж","â€¢149; Reds, 1947-1953. Following Stalin's domination of Eastern Europe and the loss of China, American democracy falls victim to anti-communist hysteria, but survives it. Eisenhower is elected President. In the Soviet Union, Stalin reinforces the climate of terror on which his rule is based. When he dies in 1953, the Soviet people mourn the end of an era. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+5736"">Video/C 5736Ж","â€¢149;Korea, 1949-1953. In June 1950, North Korea invades the South, with Stalin's blessing. The United States, backed by the United Nations, defends South Korea, and then is confronted by communist China. In mid-1951, the war grinds to a bloody stalemate but eventually an armistice is signed. Aggression has been contained. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+5736"">Video/C 5736Ж","â€¢149; After Stalin, 1953-1956. Thaw is conceivable with Stalin's death. Khrushchev outmaneuvers Malenkov for power and visits the West. Germans, Poles and Hungarians attempt to rise against Soviet rule. In 1956, an uprising in Hungary is ruthlessly crushed by Soviet tanks. The United States, pledged to contain rather than overthrow communism, does nothing.

In October 1957, the first Soviet satellite Sputnik orbits the earth--to the dismay and fear of the United States, frustrated by its own ineffectual space program. In 1961, the Soviets launch Yuri Gargarin into space. America will have to meet the challenge. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+5737"">Video/C 5737Ж","â€¢149; The Wall, 1958-1963. The fate of Germany remains unresolved. West Germany has been admitted to NATO.

Khruschev decides, with Castro's agreement, to install short-range and medium-range missiles in Cuba, only 90 miles from the U.S. The United States detects the missile sites and blockades the island. The superpowers confront each other; but rather than embark on nuclear war, they each step back. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+5738"">Video/C 5738Ж","â€¢149;Vietnam, 1954-1968. Vietnam has been divided since the end of French colonial rule. The North is run by communists, the South by anti-communists. Ignoring warnings against involvement in a nationalist struggle, the United States commits its armed forces. American protests against the war mount as the U.S. begins to realize this is not a war it can win. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+5738"">Video/C 5738Ж","â€¢149; MAD, 1960-1972. Throughout the 60s, the U.S. and the Soviet Union are locked in a nuclear stand-off; each realizes that bombing the enemy could provoke retaliation and self-destruction. Nuclear strategy evolves into Mutual Assured Destruction, or MAD, in which both sides are guaranteed certain annihilation in the event of nuclear war. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+5738"">Video/C 5738Ж","â€¢149; Make Love Not War, The Sixties. Western economies grow and prosper, fueled partly by armaments production.

There is racial violence in U.S. inner cities while rock music comes to express the mood of a disenchanted generation. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+5739"">Video/C 5739Ж","â€¢149; Red Spring, The Sixties.In the Soviet bloc, communist rule stifles ambition and achievement. Soviet defense expenditure cripples economic growth. The young lust for totems of America's youth culture--blue jeans and rock-n-roll. In Czechoslovakia, Dubcek attempts limited reform, but in 1968, Soviet force crushes the Prague Spring. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+5739"">Video/C 5739Ж","â€¢149; China, 1949-1972. Chinese communists win the longest civil war in 20th century history. Mao's land reforms are popular but in 1958, he embarks on a series of catastrophic changes. China maintains an increasingly uneasy relationship with the Soviet Union. In 1960 the Sino-Soviet split paves the way for President Nixon's historic visit to Beijing. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+5739"">Video/C 5739Ж","â€¢149; Detente, 1969-1975. North Vietnam launches a new offensive against the South. The U.S. steps up its bombing campaign but seeks peace through diplomacy. Nixon and Brezhnev sign the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT). The U.S. finally withdraws from Vietnam. Detente culminates in the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+5740"">Video/C 5740Ж","â€¢149; Good Guys, Bad Guys, 1967-1978 The superpowers use surrogates to wage ideological and often physical conflict. In 1967 and 1973, American backed-Israel triumphs over Soviet-backed Egypt and Syria. In Africa, the Soviets exploit nationalist, anti-colonial struggles. The U.S. supports South Africa in its battle against communism. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+5740"">Video/C 5740Ж","â€¢149; Backyard, 1954-1990. The U.S. has always regarded Latin America as its own backyard. Fearing the spread of communism, it seeks to destabilize leftist governments. In 1973, the CIA helps overthrow the Chilean President Salvador Allende; in the 1980s, it supports right-wing extremists in Nicaragua and El Salvador. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+5740"">Video/C 5740Ж","â€¢149; Freeze, 1977-1981. Concern for human rights in the East grows; detente ebbs. The Soviets arm Eastern Europe. The U.S. threatens to site missiles in Western Europe. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan ends detente. Promising tougher measures against Moscow, Reagan defeats Carter for the presidency. In Poland, martial law is imposed. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+5741"">Video/C 5741Ж","â€¢149; Soldiers of God, 1975-1988. Afghanistan is a war that costs the lives of almost 15,000 Soviet conscripts and an estimated one million Afghans. The U.S. supplies billions of dollars of weapons to unlikely allies--Islamic fundamentalists. The result is a Vietnam-style conflict which takes its toll on the Soviets and hastens the end of the Cold War. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+5741"">Video/C 5741Ж","â€¢149; Spies, 1944-1994. Early CIA attempts to penetrate the Iron Curtain are thwarted. The U.S. reacts with increasingly sophisticated technological intelligence--the U-2 spy-plane, satellite reconnaissance and electronic eavesdropping. Yet human spies remain important. Sometimes betrayers, sometimes betrayed, many spies pay with their lives. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+5741"">Video/C 5741Ж","â€¢149; Star Wars, 1980-1988. Reagan boosts U.S. defense spending and proposes the Strategic Defense Initiative, an anti-missile system in space. New premier Gorbachev knows the Soviets can't match the U.S., and wants to liberalize and reconstruct the Russian economy. After summits in Geneva, Reykjavik and Washington, the leaders agree to drastic arms cuts. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+5742"">Video/C 5742Ж","â€¢149; The Wall Comes Down, 1989. Incredibly quickly, the Soviet bloc is breaking up, virtually without bloodshed. First Poland, then Hungary, then East Germany slip away from communist control. Gorbachev makes no effort to hold them back with force. Amid scenes of jubilation, the hated Berlin Wall comes down. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+5742"">Video/C 5742Ж","â€¢149; Cold War. ConclusionsThe U.S. proves the stronger, the Soviet Union implodes. Germany is reunified. Shorn of its empire and communist domination, Russia faces its future with its economy in chaos. The balance of terror that has kept the peace for more than 40 years vanishes. The Cold War has ended without the use of nuclear weapons. ","Ѭ href=""http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/eVideo%2FC+5742"">Video/C 5742Ж","Eastern Europe: History and Politics"

"Grandma's Tattoos","Reveals the fate of thousands of forgotten women, mostly teenagers and young girls, who survived the 1915 Armenian Genocide but were forced into prostitution by their captors. Many of these women were tattooed as a permanent mark of their status. Filmmaker Suzanne Khardalian begins the film by remembering her grandmother: ""Grandma Khanoum was not like everyone else. She had blue tattoos on her face and hands. She despised physical contact. She never hugged anyone, never gave kisses. And she always wore gloves, which hid her hands and her tattoos, and her secret."" Haunted by these memories, Khardalian embarks on a personal journey into her family history to investigate the truth behind her late grandmother. Eventually small truths are revealed and pieces of the puzzle begin to come together. In 1919, just at the end of WWI, the Allied forces rescued nearly 100,000 Armenian girls and children who, during the war years, were forced to become prostitutes to survive, or had given birth to children after forced or arranged marriages or rape. These women were forcibly marked, tattooed, as property, the same way you mark cattle. Following the war, many of these women were viewed as impure and tainted, and often shunned by society.
