"","Agent Yellow: Not a Chinaman's Chance","This film focuses on the ambiguous role forced upon Chinese scientists and engineers who have contributed significantly to American military research while still remaining largely invisible, except when singled out for disloyalty, as in the recent case of Wen Ho Lee, or the 1950's McCarthy Era case of Hsue-Shen Tsien. It explores the pervasive American perception of China in either/or terms: either a sinister threat or a potential partner, and explores how these attitudes have led to a wariness about Chinese involvement in U.S. military technology. Produced and directed by Christine Choy. 2006. 27 min.

"The American Tapestry: Searching for the American Dream","Gregory Nava's trenchant but human examination of the American migration experience. In this documentary the much celebrated Hispanic filmmaker (""El Norte"", ""Mi Familia"", ""Selena"", etc.) explores the very personal accounts of five American families from a variety of enthnic and racial backgrounds. An elderly Polish Jew relates his arrival at Ellis Island as a seven year-old boy in the 1920's. A Chinese-born grandmother from Oakland, California recalls her own childhood arrival on Angel Island in San Francisco Bay in the early 1930's.

An African-American woman, the daughter of a slave, describes her childhood on a sharecropper's farm in Alabama and her eventual migration to Chicago.

"More to the Chinese Side.","""I used to think that we were the typical Asian American family,"" muses William Gow, a fifth-generation Chinese American of biracial descent, as several family members describe instances of how they are commonly mistaken for other ethnicities. Intrigued by thesemisperceptions, Gow invites his parents and other relatives to share their experiences and views on how they see themselves in relation to the larger Asian American community. His Caucasian mother and Chinese father provide insights into raising biracial children; his Chinese cousin observes how being adopted repeatedly throws off people's expectations of him. Interspersed with historical details about Chinese immigration to the U.S., the interviews warmly touch upon the complexities of a family negotiating ethnic identities within an Asian American community that is constantly changing. 2003. 17 min.
