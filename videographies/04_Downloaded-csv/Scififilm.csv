Combining punk rock and post-apocalyptic mayhem, Arrabal's outrageous adaptation of his infamous stage play is a gallows-humor romp in a wretched dystopia. The inhabitants of a junkyard at the edge of a nuclear crater live hand to mouth all the while being hounded by authorities from a corrupt government. Among them is Emanou, a punk rock star agitator doomed to betrayal by one of his own. A raucous and absurd retelling of the Christ story with thugs, murderers, pimps and punks. 87 min.

Hard Drive is a fictional road-movie in which a man running from technology hits the highways to meet with anarchists, hackers, cyber warriors and the boys from the Pentagon before joining the combatants in the information war. With paranoia spreading like a virus, the U.S. prepares to dominate the international brave new digital age. For many it is a step to far, and the threat is that businesses will use their power to suppress dissenting voices under the guise of protecting national interests. The question is who will win the cyber war? 54 min.

"Ice (1969)","Directed by Robert Kramer. Cast: Luke Wilson, Maya Rudolph, Dax Shepard, Terry Crews, Anthony Campos. Years into the American future urban guerillas are at war with a fascist state. We are drawn into the experience of a group and its claustrophobic politics. A cooly impersonal documentary tone and a sense of immediacy masks very personal fantasies and fears about revolution. Non-actors (including Kramer himself), drawn from the ranks of student activists and militant groups around New York, play the main roles. The emphasis is on violent action and on the discussion of tasks and terror rather than on ideas and causes. 128 min.

In a sparsely populated town set ten years after a nuclear war, the townspeople have discovered a supply of canned food but are waiting for Mr. Goldsmith to return from the cave to get the message from ""the old man"" to tell them whether it is contaminated with radiation. Some of them want to take their chances and eat the food, but they refrain from doing so after seeing the disastrous harvest yielded when they did so with their choice of land rather than taking the old man's advice about which areas were contaminated. When Mr. Goldsmith, the town's leader, returns, he informs them that the old man has declared the food contaminated and that it should be destroyed. When a group of soldiers enter the town, they try to dispel the townspeople's strange beliefs about the man in the cave. It is ultimately revealed that in reality they have been listening to a computer the whole time (no explanation is given, however, as to who, why or how the computer was placed there, or what had been powering it all this time). In a fit of rage at being deceived, the town destroys the computer and eat the canned goods it claimed were contaminated. However, as Mr. Goldsmith had insisted, the ""old man"" was correct; without an authority figure to tell them which foods are safe, the entire town (including the soldiers) dies - except for the lone survivor, Mr. Goldsmith(And also the town's horses).

"Quest for Fire (La Guerre du feu) (Canada / France / USA, 1981)","Directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud. Cast: Everett McGill, Rae Dawn Chong, Ron Perlman, Nameer El-Kadi. Colossal adventure odyssey that turns the hands of time back to the very beginning of man's existence. Against the perilous atmosphere of rugged terrain, rival tribes, and savage beasts, the vital quest ensued for the crucial flame and the knowledge to create it. The constant struggle is vividly re-created to make this a true visual extravaganza which also focuses on human drama as the primitive people experience their first feelings of compassion and caring for others. 100 min.
